I see what you mean, but I've had Linux systems set up so that if the mouse stayed on a window for a certain time period (greater than zero), then that window became active.  That would be one solution.  Another would be to simply let clicks pass to whatever control they are over, whether it is in the currently active window or not.  Is that doable?I am using Iwork and OpenOffice right now But I need some features that just MS has it.I've been using that on my MacBook Pro since I got it, with no issues.  Last week I got an iMac and immediately installed StartSound.PrefPane but it doesn't work -- any ideas why?  The settings on the two machines are identical (except the iMac has v1.1b3 instead of v1.1b2), but one is silent at startup and the other isn't....+agreed.  I would add that I think you can choose to not clone everything so it takes less time to make a bootable volumeApplications are removed from memory by the OS at it's discretion.  Just because they are in the 'task manager' does not imply they are running and in memory.  I have confirmed this with my own apps.

After a reboot, these applications are not reloaded until launched by a user.Honestly, I don't know.  It's definitely interesting though.  I'm currently scouring Google, since it would save on input clicks.  I'm just concerned that any solution might get a little "hack-y" and not behave consistently in all UI elements or applications.  The last thing I'd want is to not know if I'm focusing a window or pressing a button :(Could you expand on the features for those not familiar with ShakesPeer?Apple's vernacular is Safe Sleep.@Micheal - That might be a good question by itself?Anything faster than ShakesPeer will do actually. It is about 10 times slower than anything else (on other platforms) that I've ever used.time to get a new battery :)  maybe check out the nupower/newertech batteries at OWC.Are they any faster?this is a great feature btw... when i got my mid2010 macbook pro it really surprised me that the machine was able to recover from running down the battery.  All my programs were still there and I hadn't lost any work.someone else would have to comment on that... as I said I haven't tried them.  Just pointing you to some alternatives :)That command actually quits all running programs and logs the user out, which is likely not the desired behavior.

edit: in regards to Shift+Cmd+Opt+Q@Scottie: Come on, give me more then a few seconds.This will logout instead of locking. Although it will still require a password to return, you lose the session.@Jacob: You're not reading "the other option" for this.Wow. that's a classic screenshot: 10.2 or 10.3 era.Visor, while neat, I found to be a slight pain in the ass at times.Just a FYI, using smcfancontrol for an extended amount of time can wear out the fan bushing, leading to heat problems later on.As far as I know the System startup sound is burned directly into the computer's ROM, so firmware versions and such likely come into play. I'm sort of guessing, though, as that's a level of the system architecture I'm not overly familiar with.True, SMC fan control can be problematic if used heavily. I'll only use it if I'm doing something processor-intensive for short periods of time. Otherwise, I figure the system is smarter than I am for determining optimal fan speeds.@Chealion: Yes it is.Unfortunately, overheating has become a problem for my (now 4 year old) MBP, and smcfancontrol is the only thing I've found that keeps it from just locking up and requiring a hard power cycle.  Otherwise, just opening iPhoto can freeze my computer.  Anything over 70 degrees C and I'm in the danger zone of locking up.@Apostlion: Simply because it's subjective does not mean it can't be answered. There are (community defined) "good" applications that are useful on a daily basis.How so? I've never encountered any bugs or crashes with it, and in my workday I'm constantly jumping to my Terminal for command-line operations. Makes things so much easier -- one quick keystroke and my Terminal pops into view with keyboard focus.This applies only to web and document views as far as I know. If you click any other control in an window, it triggers regardless of wether it's active or inactive. Just a clarification.I'm on iPad (3.2.1). Now that you mention it, I have heard that there are some compatibility issues with certain jailbroken apps in 3.2....I think I'll just delete the iPod application and see what happens lol@David: Then a sensor might be bad or damaged. Take it to apple.I'm a cat owner, so I find every few months I have to open my computers up and blow the collection of cat hair out of them. If you've got pets that shed, might be worth checking.@Josh K: I disagree... I think that questions should always be able to be "answered".  I realize that many questions can have multiple right answers, but when a question is this subjective, every single answer from ever single user could theoretically be correct.@calavera: You must concede that it is not always the case. Simply because there are many "theoretically" correct answers does not preclude it from being good question. We want good questions.I'm not able to find an option for creating a 'smart' playlist.  I'm assuming this would be what I would need as it would automatically include newly added music, but the file menu only allows creation of 'dumb' playlists.Agreed with Josh. That's not normal behavior, so on an older machine it's very likely a sign of some kind of hardware failure.@Josh K: It didn't even notify me that you had answered.but that turns it off for all applications. I would just like it turned off for Safari.This discussion should be continued on meta, but I think it is the _subjective_ tag that was banned, not subjective questions.  The feeling was that the tag didn't add anything.doesn't work on my new iMac either.I'm not exactly sure what you mean by 'web and document views' but it seems to happen basically everywhere for me.  For example, if I have a Finder window open but inactive, and click on a file in it, all that happens is Finder becomes active -- I have to click the file again to get a preview of it.  Same for the X-Windows application I currently have open, although Studer appears to have a fix for that below.Stating which model of MBP you have will help, as the architecture changes over time. Assuming Unibody, at least?Can you list the file hierarchy you have under `~/Library/Application Support/Textmate`? Especially the `Bundles`, `Pristine Copy/Bundles` and `Plugins` folders.Unfortunately where I live "take it to Apple" means "ship it to Apple."  Maybe someday when I get a replacement for it and it becomes a secondary machine, but for now it's not worth it.  Shipping costs, repair costs, downtime, etc.  Maybe if it was happening during my 3 year service plan, but now it would be too much of a hassle to send it to Apple to _maybe_ fix it (since it's not entirely clear if any one particular thing is broken/replaceable).Voted to reopen - it is subjective, but a popular and useful style of question, if kept as a wiki and not repeated too much. These questions are mostly accepted on gadgets.stackexhange.com for example.You can also create a Keyboard Shortcut for this in the Keyboard Preference Pane once the menu item is made available!Awesome, I'd never seen this before.iWork support RTL but not as good as MS office.it's good trick but it's not my answer, you said " it's unavailable to the system until you reboot" but I eject my boot camp 3 month ago and I lost it in my startup disk and after that I more than 50 time reboot my laptop and still can't see my Windows partition in startup disk in system preferenceAlthough the user interface of VLC isn't the most intuitive or best designed in the universe, it is indeed the best all-round kitchen sink multimedia player for OS X as well as most other operating systems.:D Yes I install NTFS-3G Driver, is there any way I Solve this bug? or I must remove this 3rd-party software?@asbjor: The UI is something you have to learn. Like keeping your fingers off the keyboard while it's playing, otherwise you end up changing something like the audio delay or aspect ratio.Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any easy workaround. See "Known issue" for possible solution: http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/2010/06/ntfs-3g-for-mac-os-x-2010522.htmlTanx For your Help, I was really confuse what was my problem and now I find.I hadn't tried it before, but just did. Cool, and nice, but it lacks support for sound delay. Subtitle delay was there though. If they add sound delay I would definitely consider switching.I just read through the [iPhone 4 warranty pdf](http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/iphone/), and skimmed the iPhone 3GS dito. And I can't see that this statement is correct. They _may_ request the service in the country it was bought, but it's not demanded.For my unit Mac Pro (Early 2008) the specs show 5400 series Xeon on Apples websiteThat's exactly how I do it. I am surprised that their isn't something like this "out of the box".This is not correct. Virtual Memory is not memory that is allocated on disk (that is called swap). Virtual memory is that has address space allocated but is not in physical memory. That might seem like the same thing, but it subtlety different. In many cases programs allocate memory without ever touch it. In those cases the programs are using a lot of virtual memory. To give a concrete example, my system currently is using 512MB of swap, but has 196GB of virtual memory allocated (which is a pretty typical amount for people running Snow Leopard on K64).Nice work! I thought for sure the solution would have used `defaults`@Louis, if the virtual memory has been allocated but does not make use of RAM or the hard disk, then where is it?Ah, sorry. The answer is "maybe." The first units for that revision were shipped with fully populated sockets and 5400s, and you could upgrade them. It would not be shocking if later in the year they removed the socket and/or downrated the power supply to save costs. If your system has the socket and an appropriate power supply you need to get a Xeon with same stepping as the one in your machine (within a single processor model there are several different revisions, called steppings, you generally want to match steppings for SMP, or you might experience random errors), and an Apple heat sink.Didn't do the trick.  I had high hopes for that Super User suggestion as well, but it didn't work either :(  It's definitely the resource forks, and I've tried creating that local nsmb.conf file (even rebooted just to make sure) but the error persists.  It still creates the ._ file on the server and throws the same error, leaving a data file of zero bytes.+1 for your trick but what if we want do the same thing for all application? it's better find a general solution.No, sorry that would be equally annoying :)@Louis: You are correct.  It is a bit confusing however because of the way that Activity Monitor displays these bits of information.  The 196GB of VM you refer to is not the actual size of the swap file but it does describe the potential size of the swap file.  Notice how they use the phrase "can be used as memory".@Michael: nowhere.  It's theoretical.  Just because it's been allocated and assigned an address doesn't necessarily mean that it's actually being used.  The low level bits of the OS know when to map those addresses to physical locations in RAM or swap storage, but there's no need to tie up that space if the application is not actually storing information at those addresses.  Not only that, but you'll notice that column for each process, Virtual Mem, doesn't come anywhere close to adding up to the VM Size.  The processes aren't actually using all that memory.@David: Any chance of knowing if it works with Leopard? You can also try using veto_files on the server which is sometimes the cure and other times the cause of issues with Finder. (http://serverfault.com/questions/15044/preventing-mac-os-x-clients-from-polluting-windows-shares-with-resource-forks/15437#15437)You can do it using default to modify the underlying file ` /library/preferences/systemconfiguration/preferences.plist`, but the daemon running in the background won't pick it up, so you will need to kick configd and possible some other stuff after you do that. They all are signed up for a notification off the system config framework, so if you use that (which scutil does) it posts the notification after it does the equivalent of a defaults write.it was the only benefit of jailbreaking? and what was the answer for part 1?No idea on 10.5, sorry.  I've tried veto files, tried stuff here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4017  No dice yet.  There are multiple causes for this generic Finder I/O error, but so far I haven't found a solution for mine.I think this is too subjective as it stands.@Chealion I don't think so because I really want some good app, when I was use XP I can do my job only with paint but I can't find such a simple app in os x. it's really strange for me that there is good & free & simple application for editing image in os x!Didn't realize the differentiation between focused/other windows of an app before.
 
Option-Command-H works as planned.  If you have a app focused it will leave that one alone also.Quicksilver is really cool and very close to what I'm looking for!Yup, hence my suggestion to select the Finder first if you want to show desktop. It's actually "Hide Others", not "Hide All", so that makes sense.I'm going with this as the answer because you don't need to install anything... quicksilver is cool for a lot of things though!  Thanks!Cool tip, thanks Scottie!This isn't working for me... I have a screen saver setup and the required login when waking from a screen saver.  Did I miss something?To make a new CalDAV account go to ICAL > Preferences > Accounts and click the plus "+" button.@Am1rr: Ug, can't edit to rephrase the question. Try asking for an alternative to GIMP for OS X or a native port of GIMP.This one looks pretty good... how do you setup the keyboard shortcut for it though?@Josh it better change to ALternative to paint. because GIMP was not so simpleThe author has changed the question.the Pixelmator problem is that it's not free, it's cost about 50$ i need free one.Sweet, thanks everyone!That's good to know... wouldn't want the thing to turn of on me in the middle of something!Oh, that makes total sense with the aluminum case... I guess I just never thought about it!  Thanks!Thanks for the suggestions guys!If you move an application to a different monitor, won't it remember that location and be there the next time you launch it? That's pretty much how it works on my setup.The Exchange (Google Sync) mail support is a little lacking. I continue using IMAP for mail, and use Exchange for contacts and calendars. Works great!Nice, this one looks like it just works!The first line of that script will switch you back to a space with a running terminal instance the moment it runs.Which brand is the printer ?@Am1rr3zA It's a lot more useful now instead of just a list of image editing applications question. (Where we could copy and paste from the 2 or 3 that are on Super User)It's not switching on my computer. Perhaps on account of having Terminal set up to follow me in "every space", although it's not actually following me in this case.You mean from Griffin not Belkin right ?Thanks a ton! Of note, this method doesn't allow me to see the other computers on the computer this is run on but works in order to see that computer which is precisely what I need. Of note, it doesn't even need you to be signed into MobileMe. This is a crosspost from Super User - if you'd like to answer it there as well.You should up cote the VLC suggestion and make this a comment rather than answering the question again with the same application.There is plenty of VM that is not actually swappable. For instance, if you mmap a 4GB file it takes 4GB of VM, on read it will page in directly from the file, and under pressure it will be thrown out (not swapped) since the original file can simply be reread. VM and swapping are really completely different things, VM is simply used to figure out what to swap in.Nice, but you have to build it from source. I'm fine with that, but most people aren't.The point of the question is that Terminal is already running in a different space. By definition, that can never happen if Terminal's following you everywhere you go. How did you manage to prevent Terminal from following you around when it's set to every space?The Esc key is OS X is exactly in the same place it would be on Windows, right above backtick/tilde.Actually, not all PPCs supported little endian mode. In particular the G5 did not. That was not a big deal for most Mac OS X software, since it was only possible to access little endian mode using VMM (Virtual Machine Manager), a feature that was only used Connectix Virtual PC for managing a second address space holding the physical memory of the emulated PC. That was one of the reasons it took so long for Virtual PC to support G5.Voila looks like it might be worth the money.  It captures screen recordings as well.  I may have to purchase it, I'll update if I do.@NReilingh: I think he meant "a key with the same effect".It's quite possible that I just never quite wrapped my head around Xcode's SCM integration, but I've been much happier with Murky (and Versions before that) doing my SCM outside Xcode than I was trying to get Xcode to do it.Apparently, somebody (me) pressed the minus sign and removed Terminal from the list while playing around. So now every Terminal is stuck on its own desktop.

Did you actually try the mini-script above? It definitely works for me.The old Apple Extended keyboards are legends. Mechanical tactile keyboards beat the pants off the new membrane keys ;)yeah you're right. Changed it aboveTextMate has an awful UI - just like TextWrangler...VLC is sooooo old fashioned. They are working on a new UI for it, and a hope they'll make it happen soon. That project is called [Lunettes](http://wiki.videolan.org/Lunettes).Movist is really great. If you just need a media player without all that special voodoo VLC could do, give it a try.+1 I didn't know that. Great.Ah, sorry, I misunderstood. The advice above about an NTFS driver is likely your culprit.What I did was expand the answer as to _why_ I liked it, and how to use it together with other software, and what other players I tried. An answer with just a name is pretty meaningless I think. I myself would've want to know why.I really wish that the default keystroke for zooming in Photoshop AND the default keystroke for changing the language input AND the default keystroke for invoking Spotlight weren't all the same. :(+1 - This tip alone has just totally justified getting involved in the beta. I don't know how I haven't found this previously, but I have often wanted to access the menu without a mouse.+1. Even though I suggested another alternative below, I couldn't live without TextMate. [hugs TextMate]"I'm not really satisfied with the text-editors available *for MacOS X*." Is there an editor you've used on another platform that you prefer? It may be possible that a comparable equivalent exists for OS X.@scottie same hereI said in my question I use Seashore but it's was so bad.can you link your image. because you image was corrupt here!I forgot about this one, it's pretty complete and has the advantage of also being free and open-source.Eclipse is a full IDE - I want a small lightweight editor. I'm using Eclipse for big projects, but for small ones it's too much overhead.I can't remember what I used on Linux and Windows but I can't remember that I really liked an editor there...thanks for clearing that up. so then what is the correlation, if any, between VM size and the virtual mem column that is displayed per process?XCode is a full IDE, not what I'm looking for. Unfortunately TextMate isn't free :(The VM size is the total amount of address space allocated in the app, regardless of what the ultimate backing store for that address space is, and whether or not it has actually been touched.I should point out I was not clear in the first comment VSIZE includes all of RSIZE (all resident pages are still mapped in the virtual address space of the app). I should have said "but it is not physical memory", not "it is not in physical memory."Nothing attached to it. 
I am only connected to my Time Capsule.I did what you proposed but it only made it worse.
When I start Textmate it blocks immediately.

What I did before the problems started was changing the computername. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. It sounds odd that that could be the problem.@Am1rr3zA I re-uploaded it.Hrm. I'm not really sure what the issue could be, then. I don't know offhand if changing the computer name could affect TextMate or not. Have you tried changing the computer name back to what it was originally?

Maybe try this: create a brand new user account on your computer and launch Textmate in there to see if you can replicate the problem? That would at least help narrow down if the issue is related to something in your Home directory or not.Actually, Xcode 4 added Git and not Mercurial (as of Developer Preview 2, it could change until the final release)A SSD is not only more reliant, but also faster, as there are no spinning things, so there may be some gain in putting it in an iMacThe ideal program for you doesn't exist. Or, rather, it does and it's called TextMate.@Nagon right, I fixed it. Thanks.Indeed, I forgot this aspect too !+1 for you're not going to find it.
You have way too much prerequisites to find something that will match exactly.I agree that there are things, well *lacking* with text editors. I also find that between TextMate / VIM and a little shell magic I can deal just fine.Especially if, as Josh said, 'free' is one of those prerequisites.The first two are the standard emacs keybindings, and you can use many of the standard emacs keybindings on (all?) Cocoa applications.  `ctrl+t` is a favourite one: for transposing two characters.I love ctrl-alt-cmd-8; we used to do that at all the computers to joke people, but if you're working at night it works well too.Nice trick! Thank youTrue. Nice one for `ctrl-t` !Virusbarrier is really good.v1.1b3: is that a beta release (the b in the version number)? If so, you might want to try installing a stable release.PS: There's a list of all Mac OS Keyboard Shortcuts available at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343Cool. Thanks for the info!While this is true, it's also a much easier upgrade to think about at a later date. The benefits of a faster processor in a desktop certainly outweigh those of an SSD.Beta was my first thought too, but my guess is that it might mean build... The previous version that I installed a year ago on my MBP was v1.1b2, and the download site only offers one release for Intel processors, 1.1b3, under the heading "Version 1.1, Latest version".That's not really what was asked though -- it wouldn't keep contacts on the phone and two different computers all in sync.@longda: Go to the Keyboard Preference Pane, and go to the Keyboard Shortcuts section. Add a new Application Shortcut with the menu name of Lock Screen. (http://www.macworld.com/article/49080/2006/01/lockscreen.html)but it was bad what if the size of program was 1GB?1GB would be the size of whole update. Not only iTunes. AFAIK - iTunes takes a bit more than 100MBs so far.I know what is the size of itunes, I mean what if we install apps with size of 1GB each time we want update must download all 1GB!Yes, that would be the case. But most of the time - those apps are being split into few smaller utility apps.Thanks for the link... I still can't seem to get the keyboard binding to work though.  Very sad since that link walks you through how to set it up... :TI like it!  I think this is the closest to what I was looking for.This isn't correct at all. Applications can be "patched" so to speak.Once again I think Activity Monitor's terminology is confusing our discussion.  In your second to last comment you say that VM size is the "total amount of address space allocated in the app".  Are you actually referring to the "Virtual Mem" column that is displayed for each process?Try moving files in Spotlight. ;) You can do just about anything you want in QS.That's somewhat true if you're only using Quicksilver as a launcher.  It's considerably more than that.  However, even just as a launcher, I've found quicksilver to be:
-faster
-smarter (pulling up apps + commonly used files, rather than just the best search match)
-More adaptable (If you regularly type "pho" and switch down from the first result of Photobooth to the third result of Photoshop, it'll figure that out and start putting Photoshop first for "pho").good point.  The problem with these particular copies is that the folders reside on an NTFS volume, so I don't have write access in OS X :/  Do you know of a way to compress the files on the NTFS volume before copy?@calavera: You could [enable write support](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090913140023382). ;)`diff -qr` is awesome for quick and dirty checks.@intlect This does not work for me. It changes to the desktop Terminal is already running on.It won't really solve my problem: most of the time I want to run a program in French, but _sometimes_ it will be English.Under the hood, it just launches the program with a `-AppleLanguages (French)` switch, which is what I really needed. Thank you!Have this +1, since you were just a few seconds too late. Thanks for the preferences tip, I didn't know it.Next time I'll be faster ;)Console? Where in console?

I have chained multiple smart mailboxes together to get the result I want but this shouldn't be necessary if the filters worked the way they shouldit's a good way but it's not easy as Language Switcher can do.If this fails, start iTunes, connect the power cable, hold the power and home button for 10 seconds.  Release the power button, but CONTINUE to hold the home button and you will be able to restore.Confirmed. I have got a SSD in my desktop and I still get those moments where I think "hang on, that should have taken much longer - surely something went wrong". But nothing went wrong - it worked just very fast.+1 with a few choice plugins this is by far the best "light weight" text editor available.I think it's bug, and there is no other short key except what you said (cmd + `)Console.app in the Utilities folder - if there is an error message it should show up there. I wasn't able to reproduce it on my end - but yes I agree that chaining mailboxes shouldn't be necessary.The kids in our school call it the x-ray mode.Depends if you're more a GUI- or a CLI-man.This no longer work in Snow Leopard.If I was to get an SSD, it wouldn't be for the reliability - the speed & responsiveness is the main advantage they offer. @LessPop, that is the sort of stuff I was looking to hear, but what do you have that backs that up? I would have assumed it would almost certainly be the other way around.@NReilingh why you think is lacking for mail?It doesn't seem he wanted to restore his iDevice.Looks promising. Has somebody already use it ?@LessPop For the given use-case of web browsing and word processing, a faster processor would make no difference. An SSD, on the other hand, would have an immediate and stark difference. Your PC would boot in less than 30 seconds, for instance.I think you get what you pay for in most cases and a text editor is no different so don't expect to get everything you're looking for at no cost.  The price of TextMate is really worth it IMHO.@Adam Lassek: Uncheck "When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application" under System Preferences - Expose and Spaces - Spaces. You'll still be able to switch to the space where an application is if you double click it's icon on the dock.Aha! When I disabled that option, I can simply switch to the Terminal app and hit command+N. Much better!By VSIZE I am referring to what to something that is not listed in activity monitor, you can see it listed in top if you want. What Activity Monitor lists in the virtual memory column is what is generally referred to as VPRVT, which is is the amount of virtual address used by the app that is not shared with any other apps.The development of WebScripter has been suspended and is now being offered as freeware but no new versions will be released. :'(Redcar is not finished! :(Yeah, I was kind of expecting that, however, I find it slightly odd that there is no way (apparently) to cycle through all open windows in the OS, irregardless of which application has opened them.Is there a menu in Adobe Acrobat Pro to do so? If this is the case, you can define your own shortcut in Preference Pane > Keyboard > Keyboard ShortcutsYes, and I was successful upgrading, but it doesn't make sense that this issue would return every time I wanted to upgrade.Thanks Scottie that was the solution. 
Although I am not sure what the cause is but creating a new user and working with that solved the issue.
With the "bad" user there was also something bizar with the terminal. If I have the time and more experienced I definitely going to find out what was the cause. I've transfered everything to the new user and work with that now.for the books you can search in amazon.+1 - my experience too. I've yet to find a USB hub (or a port on any of my Macs and Dell PCs) that will noticeably charge my iPad.I don't understand what you're trying to achieve, do you use your Laptop as router and connecting the iPod Touch to it with a VPN ?Is the book you've mentioned still relevant?
I ask this because it is from 2006 and maybe outdated?Careful for apps that override the default keystrokes with their own. Photoshop is particularly annoying in this regard.aha, that makes sense.  Thanks Louis.How are the machines connected ?That documentation is slightly dated, recent updates to the AirPort Extreme do allow a USB drive to be plugged in and used as a Time Machine storage device.  AirPort Extreme + 1 TB USB disk = cheaper and just as effective (I've used one for recovery, worked fine) Time Capsule :)Even if the disk is Windows-formatted? Huh. News to me!true, I actually used to use an external USB drive to do time machine in the past, but now I need to make it to work w/ Windows share and I know it's possible to do@Geert VanLaethem: While the book is from the Tiger era much of it still holds true. Where the book is outdated the info should at least get you on the right track to find out what has changed.I would think it's still relevant. I wonder if a second edition is planned.@Scottie: Well, not a Windows formatted disk.  The relevant part of the documentation likely still applies, but the external disk on the AirPort Extreme part is dated.but doing that isn't sufficient, you've gotta create disk image as wellthis option just work when you RIP the CD but when you download MP3 this option doesn't work. then it's not a proper answer for me:(how are you connected to internet and server?what quicksilver does?@Am1rr: Ah, I thought these were from CD. Second option: [iEatBrainz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEatBrainz), though that comes with issues like not having an "official" UB.Quicksilver is an intuitive, self learning, application launcher and system manipulator. Best I can phrase it.This won't just sort out files, it will group by file type. Folders won't appear first and all file types will be separately sorted.@Scottie - Also bear in mind that when backing up to a "Windows share" the true format of the disk (Windows NTFS, FAT32, EXT3, etc) becomes irrelevant.The problem with subjective questions is they lose relevance much more readily. The answer to a specific problem generally remains the same as the days go on. The answers to a subjective question such as this generally become less relevant in the face of time.

3-can you explain which part is related to my answer?I must add some note about your answer:
1-iEastBraind was not supprted in futur and developer leave the project but maybe in future they put the source of code in sourceforge.
2-Jaikoz was not free :(
3- except iEatBrainz other application you suggest was not compatible and work with iTunes :(Too bad. I will be keeping an eye on it for when it does start to mature.In the past I've used Multiclutch for this, but Multiclutch is 32bit and doesn't seem to work on Snow Leopard. There doesn't seem to be viable replacement at this time.Can we make this Community Wiki? And also 1 app per answer?
Much easier to check if something has already been said and to edit to add information about said app. Thank you.It seems to depend on the application.  Terminal does remember, X-Windows doesn't, for example.I too have the latest version, but I have swedish as my system language so a screenshot from my computer would probably be even more confusing. But in the latest version it's still the setting that's located second to top in the Tweaks tab.
And when the alpha expire there will probably be a new one released or the final version will be released, which will cost 15$ according to the developers website.+1 to sole your -1, because I thought your answer was related. I don't know who give you -1 and why!I like this one, but it's better if it's also free :Pbut it was not what I mean, path finder was a separate program and also didn't what I want!@Loic: Good point, I noticed it has been reopened.It is the only book of that sort written specifically about OS X.VirtualBox is just plain awesome.I don't want to write to my NTFS volume, I want to get stuff off of it so I can wipe it and do something else with it :)  Also, muddybulldog touches on the other issue this would cause.  The files are very large, so compressing them would likely take a long time for very little benefit considering that CloneZilla already gzip's the img files.  For something smaller, compression would definitely make sense for quick checksumming.I've had the same issue here...@Geert: The book is definitely still relevant.  I wondered the same thing until I got my hands on it... unless Apple changes the entire architecture and rewrite the kernel, this book will be useful for a long time to come.I know the site is still in beta, but really? Downvoting someone for directly quoting Apple's own support docs? Tough crowd.Thanks for the link to TotalFinder, I'm finding it very useful already. I like the hidden files view - nice and grey rather than same colour as normal files, and the tabs are proving useful too.@Am1rr3zA - see my answer below for a picture of the current tweaks screen.Tanx for your help, but why don't vote for your answer?@Am1rr3zA - TotalFinder was @Nagon's answer really - if you were allowed to paste images into comments then I would have just put this image below his/her answer. :-)ok I got it, but I vote you for your help, and accept and vote @nagon answer.@robsoft - If you don't mind I can put your image in my answer or at least point to your answer in some way? :)could make your answer community wiki, please?@Jacob could make your answer community wiki, please?could make your answer community wiki, please?@am1 could make your answer community wiki, please?@josh could make your answer community wiki, please?That's what I suspected. Thank you for the answer though, it seems to be the closest to a solution of this.Thanks! But yeah I did all of these. They weren't quite as intensive as I'd like.Yeah I am going through the Currency Converter example again now. Yes I am actually looking for a complete beginner tutorial. I saw "Dashcode for Dummies" but it won't be out until February 2011 lol.Love the [command] + [option] + [click on desktop] tip - that's really useful!I'm definitely interested to know this.  I discovered upon buying a new iPhone and giving my old one to my wife that "resetting to default settings" or whatever it was called in iTunes did _not_ reset everything.  The first thing she did was try to download an app and it prompted her for my iTunes store password with the email pre-filled in.@josh I removed TextMate since there's already an answer with it and made Adium a separate one.@Nagon - by all means, be my guest! :-)@robsoft I linked to your answer, thanks for contributing with a proper screenshot! :)+agreed. Bean is very quick + not bloated like openOffice.@Loic: That's fine."XML" doesn't really need "human-readable file".What version of Mac OS X are you using? Both Leopard and Snow Leopard's version of TextEdit opens .docx files fine for me.As I said, the network connection is fine- I kept ping running in a terminal window and saw no loss in connection.  If it's a network issue, it'd have to be for less than a second (or affect only Aim traffic).

Chax I will check out, though.Over VPN, but initially I can connect them to same LANNo. I want to use my iMac (sorry didn't clarify that) that sits at home and use that to provide a secure connection to the internet when at the coffee shop or other public places.That's almost what I was looking for. Didn't knew that someone "continued" Smultron :)Yep that's what I've been doing. Thanks!@robsoft: I didn't know about the joining of PDFs.
Can you explain how this happens? (Or am I misunderstanding you?) IE: document1.pdf and document2.pdf and then save it out as a merged document.pdf?

I've tried the obvious stuff and it doesn't seem to work.I had to use this method right now instead of mine, because I didn't have the Mac OS X DVD with me and it works perfectly !true, but it's still a pretty cool tip... maybe better suited as a comment though :)+1 Would love to find a fix for this - especially when clearing the history does nothing to resolve it. (Just shows as "Top Hit").This worked perfectly, going to leave this open for a day or so to see if there's a faster way to do this on the fly from the address bar though. Thanks!It's fast enough I think :P and also your welcome.@LessPop_MoreFizz: Does this fix it for you?That didn't do it, same error as before.Just came to the site to ask the exact same question!@Jacob Community Wiki means every user can edit and add information to your answer. See http://cl.ly/24dW for more information.@less if you don't want to click, you can always use `Opt+Cmd+2` to access HistoryI really wish it would notify when an answer had been posted...@Cameron - sure, I didn't get this at first. It's not totally intuitive. First, open a PDF document. Press Shift-Cmd-D (or select View Sidebar from View menu). Now drag another PDF file (from Finder, Desktop etc) onto the PDF file you can see in the sidebar (drop your 2nd doc on top of the 1st, not into blank area of sidebar). Preview will join the documents together (you can revert, or save, save as, etc). All of the pdf stuff seems to be driven through the sidebar. Let me know if you get it, otherwise I'll try make a little online tutorial. :-)@Chealion: Yes it does.@LessPop_MoreFizz: Good to hear.Is this possible with an iOS device, or only old / classic iPod?TextMate 2.0 is the new Duke Nukem Forever ;-)possible duplicate of [Is there any features like winamp auto tag exists for iTunes?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/286/is-there-any-features-like-winamp-auto-tag-exists-for-itunes)@gsharp I believe there are issues with syncing saved drafts. Google has this information posted in "known limitations." http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139635@datagutt: How good is it at detecting Windows viruses? Sometimes I get infected documents from Windows users, and I really hate passing them on to others.If you can put it in disk mode you can use it with anything. I'm not up to date on how to do that with newer iOS devices, but I assume there is a way.And if you ever want to make sure that no one can reset your password this simply, you can boot your OS X Install Disk and go to Firmware Utility and set a password.

After that, no one will be able to boot from another source without first typing the firmware password.That's brilliant! No longer do I have to wait for bloated Acrobat to open do merge documents.

My issue was I opened both PDFs up at once, which stuck them both in the sidebar as separate PDFs, and wouldn't let me do it. Trick is to just open the one, and then do the dragging.

Thanks much!If you have Firebug open you'll notice it checks about once a minute for new answers. If it's closer then that it won't notify.It's also a great clipboard manager, giving access to history via a keystroke. One of the most feature-rich apps I've used.Did you forget a line? It isn't working, and when I stick the code directly into Terminal, it asks for my password. Possibly that's why it isn't running in the up script too?

Actually, removing the su line (and it's counterpart ' below) doesn't work either. I would expect it to at least make the dir and possibly connect, but not let me access the folder.

(and yep, set nameserver is checked)@Josh K: Not sure why but on Apple.SE it hasn't worked for me. Am1rr3zA's answer was up for 10 minutes without a notification as I was fact checking my answer.The `su` command is used to impersonate someone (you in this case). Both scripts are executed as `root` and he doesn't need a password when using `su` but another user will need one. If the command inside `su` isn't working alone, the problem comes from here. What exactly did you type ?I always switched to finder and then used Hide Others, never knew you could click the icon on the dock to do it though!  Very handy tip thanksThat seems to be the only solution.This only works for the current session.Okay, wasn't sure that tunnelblick would run it as root.

If I take the command inside of the su and drop it directly into terminal, it runs fine. If I remove the su part and just have the command in the up script, nothing happens.

exit 0+1 for your brief and complete explanation, but if you add some image it's become better.+1 for your reference!It is quick! I was just looking for something like Preview, but this is great.I like this solution better. Much less hassle.I already disabled it and it doesn't have any effect. Does it work for you?
BTW, I'm running 5.0.9370.Thanks. Will probably do that if I don't find anything on the Mac side...Damn. I thought I could use this to switch between OS X and Windows efficiently, but the boot loader won't let you boot on anything else than Mac OS if it's been put in hibernation.I think for you it's better to use parallels Desktop. it's really good software and make you able to boot your install windows on your mac.Are you sure quicktime is actually installed- and is installed where iTunes thinks it should be?@Am1rr3zA: I already have VMWare Fusion, that I use for work-related stuff. The reason I want to boot my machine on Windows is to play Starcraft 2, because performances on OS X are far below those of Windows.I am glad you plat Starcraft II, I am a big fan of blizzard too but I get starcraft for OS X and don't have your problem :PI did a lot of cleanup. Changed all the app names to `##` (because it was the most commonly used in the existing answers. Moved links so that they were within the app names.  Removed some first-person descriptors.@Jacob it would also allow me to edit your entry so that its format is similar to the other answers :)yes, i just meant the ESC key has no effect.It's funny, Textmate, along with a browser and Terminal is open almost all the time on my desktop, but whilst it's a great text editor I could 'live' with the alternatives.@Am1rr3zA: it's totally playable under OS X for sure. However, with my current-gen MacBook Pro under Windows I can put the game in 1680x1050 with graphics somewhere above medium and still get a smooth 60+ frames per second, and it never drops below that. Under Mac OS, with the same settings, things aren't smooth. So it's good for you if you like Starcraft II under Mac OS, but until Apple or NVidia or whoever's responsible does some serious efforts at making the graphics drivers better, I'll play it under Windows because there is a very noticeable difference.Ditto. Open permanently and the main reason I moved from PC's - a decent unix access point.Works on iPhone as well+1 nice question I must search about this subject.Exists a Free Solution?I edited my answer you can use this method for free.Ok, Today I will try with the one I have.Ok, Today I will try with the One I have+1.  Especially the point **the iPad's battery [...] is charged (again, slowly) when the iPad is asleep.**  I confirmed this; took my 50% charged iPad to 91% after a few hours, even on a USB port that had it displaying "Not Charging" when the screen was active.  Thanks!The reason the bootloader will not let you boot into something else when there is a hibernate image is that the hibernated version of the kernel may have references to blocks on the disk, and if you boot into another OS it wouldn't know that, which means it could modify the disk. When the hibernated OS was thawed it would then potentially write out its dirty buffers to the disk on top of blocks that had already been modified, leading to disk corruption. Fundamentally, it is never safe to thaw a hibernation if there is a chance the filesystem it is rooted off has been modified.Wow - that was faster than I expected. :-)At your service, Sir.Free version info: http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/acornfree.html

"You can use Acorn 2 without paying a single cent. How awesome is that?

Here's how it works: when you first download Acorn, it runs in "trial mode" for a couple of weeks. If you decide not to purchase it after 14 days, the trial will end and Acorn will disable some advanced features, but will continue working for your image editing needs. You can still open images and crop, filter, rotate, add layers, add text, touchup and just have fun with your images. All without paying a single cent, and completely guilt free."Thanks, that's interesting. I don't have anything in my 'My Documents' folder in Goodreader, but I'll have a go at seeing how I would get stuff into there. :-)I agree so much. Prowl is amazing...calavera: can't wait for Mac OS XIYou can get it in via a plethora of different means: iTunes file sharing, opening from email, (tap and hold an attachment), via any webdav server, mobileMe, you name it they probably have it...@Louis Gerbarg: I didn't think about that (probably because Windows can't write to Mac OS files), but that seems like a good reason.@Tom - thanks, have got it now. Nice one!This is all setup already. The problem is the routing from VPN connection to the internet. It isn't working.How do I repair permissions and where are the logs?http://osx.iusethis.com/Nice. I couldn't add a screencap, as I'm currently on an older Mac that doesn't support it so the option isn't there.Apple release an update some days ago to enable this feature on older Mac (older, yes, but newer than 2008-2009).+1 I really love this 3rs-party.Hasn't shown up on my machine, but my home MBP is the early 2008 model, so it's likely not a supported option. No biggie, since it was one of the first things I disabled on my work computer.iOS is so weird. No filesystem means you have to do the clunkiest stuff that should be so easy.There are 3rd party Windows drivers that can read and write HFS+, as can Linux, or a second OS X install. The firmware doesn't know what will happen once it boots the OS, all it can tell is whether or not it is booting off the same partition it booted off the last time.this just solve time issue and some one on superuser told me how solve other problem?What's the point with the clock setting ? I don't see how they're related.I just want said that this registry solve the clock issue not the problem about I lost my login items that I set in the system.Actually, I believe you should post another question about the login. And accept this answer for the wrong date issue.@Cameron - It's installed in the same place the original iTunes installation installed it.as I edit my question I explain that the date issue was solved before in superuser I just copy & paste my question from there, and also I changed my title, Sorry for any inconvenience caused.Like the person told you on Super User, you've got two problems, so you've got to ask two questions.
Since the time problem is solved, **remove it (the registry hack) from this question**. This led @studer to think you still had a time difference problem and might fool other people too.For similar options, also look at Google Quick Search Box. Apple's Spotlight now has many of the more interesting Quicksilver features as well.If you reboot OS X without booting in Windows, do the login items disappear? I can't see why booting to Windows would mess up the Mac OS X login items.awesome! I didn't know either about the merging. Why would they hide it that much?I know nothing about Windows Live Writer, but would iWeb fit your needs? It's bundled with every Mac.if spotlight would appear in the middle of my screen, I'd be almost happy, but Quicksilver is still way much better for launching appsIn the past when I was doing this sort of meta-organization, I used the Comment field for it. I eventually gave up because I didn't want to manually tag 5,000+ songs! :)no it won't disappear, if I directly boot my os x.+1 for iStat. Best Gadget I knowI don't vote for closing, but I predict this question will be closed.It needs at least to interface with existing blogging platforms, using MetaWeblog APIit's community-wiki, not a question. problem is already discussed here in the comment of the question : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82/os-x-applications-you-cant-live-withoutI know, but you will see what happen, in order to the SE rules this must be closed. but I myself Wonder what is the benefit of community wikiit's a useful resource that doesn't answer a specific question, but helps the community.I am agree with you.I suggest you use @LessPop_MoreFizz solution because if you use NTFS-3G you may encounter some bugs such as: all NTFS drives will disappear from the "Startup Disk" preference panecan you update your post with the list of your login items?I'd rather use a solid MacFuse-based solution like NTFS-3G which runs in userspace (it means that if it crashes it won't crash your mac) than an untested, undocumented, not recommended solution in kernelspace (it will crash your mac). See the comments on MacOSX Hints for more evidence. Also, NTFS-3G now is behind a company that makes money off of this.@pablo if you really can't live without it, maybe you should put more time in specifying why, no?I was going to suggest emacs, but obviously this fits the billYeah, this might be a bit too SOish for this site, but I wouldn't vote it down.

And does this Apple link http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23441?viewlocale=en_US by chance help at all?ya I really love this features, but it is not so hidden.Wow.   I had NO idea.   This makes me think I need to go back and read GoodReader's docs to see what else it can do.@Louis Gerbarg: Yeah, I know that. It should have read "My Windows installation".Just so you know, files there are supposed to be inert, and will not break anything should they stay in place.The built-in write support is disabled because it is __unstable__. I've corrupted a drive using it.Check out @Tom's GoodReader workaround.@zneak: Thanks for the explanation. It's still annoying that it takes up space on the hard-drive.I think I don't get what exactly you want! because you can use zoom tool (right-down corner) to increase font of files and folder. do you want something else?Basically I want to increase the display scale factor to have a bigger (in size) menu bar that'll allow:
1> increased font size for Menu Bar and the left panel of the Finder Window
2> larger 'close', 'minimize' button on the menu bar

Using zoom-in and out constantly does get tiresome and decreases work efficiency. I am a graphic designer and use Adobe tools such as Flash, Photoshop, Dreamweaver extensively. 

I can't use my macbook pro much because of tiny font and GUI elements. Feels like I bought an expensive piece of paperweight.The question was how to prevent access to the hard drive, not finding it. I want to protect my data prior to find my laptop, as here in Denmark, a simple 100 dollars a year insurance for personal goods, will cover the full amount of a new laptop, phone, glasses, etc.You're asking for resolution independence, which Mac OS hasn't fully achieved yet. The best you'll get is probably AppleDisplayScaleFactor.That's a pretty dirty hack.It's probably related to a LaunchAgent. Maybe I can find which.'mac resolution independence' forums have been around 2007 and some claim that apple confirmed it would be available with Leopard but nothing has happened.

Anyways, Thanks for you help guys.I bet you won't find a Mac OS X driver for this product.Another +1 for iStat. Crucial app on any Mac.cool, thanks for that one :)seems like MarsEdit is the most used/standard/best option for nowWhy downvoted? If you *can* live without Eclipse, perhaps just abstain from upvoting this?Even for my purchased content? Do I have to reauthorize the new computer?BootCamp is not the only way. You could write the driver yourself ;)Firefox and Mac OS X just don't mix :( Safari also has add-ons :)I think iWork pwns :)With VMWare, USB ports can be overridden by the Windows OS, so anything plugged into a given USB port will be seen by Windows. But it seems to me it would just be easier (and cheaper) to find a modem that explicitly supports Mac OS X.Why is this "community wiki"?At the same time, large suites like Adobe's Creative Suite sometimes don't have an uninstaller but instead detailed instructions on how to manually uninstall all components (and it's not fun at all).Update: Chax is an ok workaround.

It's probably better to get used to it.  (You won't have it remapped on a school's, library's, or friend's Mac for example.)  I switch between OS X, Windows, and Linux all the time and while it took a little getting used to each of them, spending the time has been worth it.+1 really nice and usefull app.Thats well and good, but in the meantime I have no work laptop. I'm also choosing to deal directly with the retailer here (not Apple), as New Zealand consumer law states that they should be responsible for redress in this situation. It also states that, regardless of any manufacturer warranty, the goods must last a reasonable time without failure (meaning that a NZD $3500 laptop is effectively warranted for much longer than 1 year). That is why extended warranties here are a real consumer rip off... but thats another story :-)I use Jing for that as it can be used for screencasts up to 5 minutes as well and not only pics :)I never liked the app :( I installed http://www.phpmyadmin.net and use it from localhost.The service's provided by the Dictionary application.

You have 10 answers, with the community settling on TextMate (though I'm a `BBEdit` man myself) and Xcode, but you more or less shot down every single one within the comments. I don't think you're ever going to find the "perfect" text editor that suits your particular tastes unless you just code it yourself.Doh! I guess I should have looked through the apps. ;)@zneak - You're right. Spotlight is the way to go.

I cloned my whole drive, booted from said clone, and created the symbolic link from there.  So there were some minor differences in that I created the symbolic link like so: `ln -s /Volumes/NewUsersVolume/Users /Volumes/NormalBootVolume/Users`.  Rebooted and tested all my apps out, even ran today's security update.  So far everything is working like a charm.I think he's actually asking how to remove individual searches or auto-completes from the list.  Like when you search "porn movies" and forgot to turn on private browsing, but don't want your girlfriend to know you searched for that in her browser.  If you remove all history, she'll want to know what you have to hide, but if you leave the search in there, it might pop up when she's searching for potato salad.

As for the warranties, sounds like you've got a good thing going down there.  Here, if your screen dies on a macbook pro out of warranty, it'll cost more to fix it than to replace the laptop- Applecare at $300 for an additional 2 years is a pretty good deal.One solution if your stuck pixel is within acceptable limits is to find a good Apple Authorized Repair shop in your area.  These people are authorized to do repairs for free under Applecare, and can use some degree of discretion in doing so.  Some will go strictly by the book, but some will get things like this repaired despite it being inside acceptable limits.The application Stickies is much more useful in my opinion. Faster, easier to use, and can use the keyboard shortcuts for fast recording purposes. :)I remembered that, however for a previous version of Mac OS X it was for searching only within file names. Now it is like you said.I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'show anything'. Anyway I've looked at other plist files and they have the same values, so I don't think that's the problem.Transmit 4 is awesome.

This still makes the phone vibrate regardless of if the number is in the black list.You could use the Migration assistant to just get back everything from your old Mac."However this doesn't work" What do you get instead? Does `launchctl` exit like everything went fine, or you have an error? Does `launchctl list` show the daemon?Ditto, unfortunately.When's that going to happen?*Soon*, as Apple released the beta 3 on August 3rd, I would say in less than one month.You'd think that, but it's fairly common I found out : http://bit.ly/awMg9tIt doesn't really matter what Apple thinks, as this defect is covered by New Zealand consumer law. Under this law, Apples 1 year warranty is also much shorter than their actual legal obligations here. If it develops a fault within a few years after this period, I should still be able to get it resolved at no cost. We have a Consumers Guarantee Act that states that goods must be of a reasonable quality (which covers the stuck pixel) and last a reasonable amount of time before going to the dogs. 

I tried a few of the suggestions prior to contacting the retailer, but thanks anyway.Yeah, consumers are well taken care of down here. Retailers still haven't cottoned on to this though, and still try to sell extended warranties when you purchase expensive goods, but us consumers have been well trained by consumer advocate groups that these are rarely necessary, and in fact the claims process is sometimes harder than getting redress under the Consumers Guarantees Act.

I just hope that I'm not the fella solely responsible for keeping the screen quality metric down, and that my next replacement doesn't have the same problem. :-)could you please tell what is your cpu and amount of your ram? and how many apps you install?Somebody with a big more reputation than me want to creat a "case" or "accessory" tag?Same exact thing for me... good question!Sadly, I have to agree there is no OSX feature built-in... :(I change my accepted answer because I think your answer was better.Oops...guess I was skimming...Works in a lot of apps too, not just Safari.  Very handy for long lists.Who/what defines *reasonable quality*? Apple says one stuck pixel is within the spec, as does the  [ISO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization). Can you send a laptop back if it doesn't make you a good cup of tea in the morning? From what you write, it's irrelevant that the maker never said it *would*. Yikes!++ for VirtualBox.  It's free, easy as hell to get started with basic functionality, has awesome documentation, has lots of advanced options once you get more comfortable, and is indeed VERY stable.I'm going to try this right now, this is _much_ better than the way I've been doing it.+1 for your trick, but do you know why apple just let resharing AFP? or do you have any link?@Amirr3zA: I'm not sure why - it's not in the documentation either. To be honest I was expecting to not be able toYa, that's was I though, too.There's no multitasking on a 2nd generation iTouch, I don't think. Unless it's jailbroken.It worked!! I've been waiting for this for months. Thank you so much!As long as this is a CW why vote it down?!?!Yes, I have been through those steps without success.*Cycle count is 469, which means battery has been discharged and recharged 213 times* how does the math behind this work?Have you tried calling AppleCare?Thanks. I actually decided to take another option: mount my NAS as a NFS share, which appears then automatically in the list of volumes.Ah, so they are mostly useless for a lot of people. Wish they could be permanently removed :(Why do you want to remove them ? They don't take any space (if empty).Close the door ?If you only want answers to match "How to I tell OSX to use the software I installed via macports?", perhaps you should edit your question. Because, you're asking two different things.Hmm, maybe it is just a bug in my version of Acrobat (9.3.2), I'll see if I can upgrade it.+1 Me too! Especially the swearing. And it rarely works (I suspect the Mac's audio-in is still asleep at this point). Briefly blipping the power button works fairly often, though.Ah, yes! This was the command that I needed! Thank you very much. :)So, when the iPhone is connected, you are able to manually trigger the sync process, and that works fine, yes?@muddybulldog, what makes you think this would be "un-pruned"? A poll like this can very much be dynamic and "alive", because we have 1) the voting system, 2) ability to edit posts, and 3) possibility to add new answers when new great apps appear!Cheaper alternatives exist, but I haven't regretted buying Things (having used it for almost 2 years). I like the simple yet powerful UI.Bummer. In looking at the threads in some of those links, there are pointers to possible issues, like misbehaving connected peripherals, and the like. Either way, I would still take it in to a Genius Bar if I were you, though. At least then an Apple employee can look at it, register the issue into their system, and maybe get you in line sooner for a fix later.Oh, brilliant - thanks! I've upvoted his answer there, and given you some credit here for pointing me to the right place. There are some good suggestions there, and I almost can't wait for the problem to occur again now. :-)+1 for Torchlight. If you enjoyed Diablo II, you'll love the crap out of Torchlight.Steam is not a game though. As much as I would love to upvote this purely based on the awesomeness of Steam, I encourage you to submit actual games, not distribution platforms :pA comparison of available virtualization options has been discussed quite a bit over on Superuser as well. Worth checking out.

http://superuser.com/questions/45680/whats-better-a-better-vm-app-vmware-parallels-or-virtual-pcBah! 53 seconds too slow! :P+1. This is definitely the way to go if you're wanting to play games at all. Gaming in a virtualized environment is nothing more than an exercise in self-flagellation.+1 I use VMware Fusion to run Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, 2008 etc. I'm a software developer (Windows, database, desktop apps) and the fact that I can give my VMs to PC-owning clients, and they can load them up and use them in VMware Workstation, is a huge bonus. The integration between OS X and the virtual machine (particularly Windows ones) is very good, with networking, shared folders, clipboards etc. It works much better than you might expect it would!That really depends on the kind of work you do. If you *must* use Xcode, AutoCAD or Photoshop, then of course you need a laptop/desktop. But I know a lot of people (writers, musicians, painters) who get real work done on the iPad, with much greater efficiency than a laptop/desktop.+1 for the picture.I used to use TweetDeck, but after trying this (when it was made free and renamed Twitter for iPhone) I haven't gone back. Very smooth, inspired UI.Seems to be the best option available.Repairing permissions seemed to work! Thanks!+1 for Portal.  Since its on Steam I think you can re-use your license as a switcher.This would probably be a better question to ask on SO, as they would have much better knowledge of what is and isn't possible from a programmers perspective.Just like quicksilver .)That's done the trick, thanks.I didn't vote it down, but it's a very wide ranging question, perhaps it would be useful to target it a bit more specifically. It's essentially an entire computing platform, potential uses are extensive.What type of Wifi router is the iMac connecting to? Is it the only device connected to the router when the issue occurs?Agreed. Definitely sounds like a permissions issue. Get info on the folder described above and let us know what permissions are set.For reference I had this same issue with my iMac - it was fixed with 10.6.+1 for originally having found the solution.The term reasonable quality is intentionally vague, as it has to cover a broad spectrum of consumer items. That is also why the CGA doesn't define a set period to cover goods for, and instead states they must last a reasonable time. After all, you wouldn't expect a $50 chilly bin to be as robust as, or last as long as, a $3000 refrigerator.

Over here a $3500 Macbook Pro would be considered a high end laptop, and as such it would be reasonably expected that such a premium product would be free from any manufacturing defects, which a stuck or dead pixel would be considered to be.And as for your tea making argument; that isn't a question of quality, but one of stated or expected functionality. It would only be relevant if the manufacturer had advertised that the laptop DID make a morning cuppa, but it failed to perform this advertised functionality (or if it was commonly accepted that laptops do indeed make cups of coffee). 

Likewise, it is expected that a refrigerator will keep your food cold. But if you bought one that doesn't, the manufacturer doesn't have an escape clause just because he didn't state that this particular model of fridge kept stuff cold.Your Google Foo is better than mine :)
9.2.1 so I guess it's not fixed.Most addictive game EVER !The phone doesn't need to be jailbroken, just unlocked.Whatever advantages there may be for one person may not necessaraly be advantages for you. Intel based Mac's are great, boot up an Ubuntu VM or boot camp and try it out. Figuring out what's best for you is best done *by you*, not anyone else.How would you get it back into the dashboard? Would you have to delete it and then add again?I forget what brand it is (net gear I think), but we have the iMac, a MacBook, MacBook pro, four iPhones, and the iPad connected to it, and the iMac is the only device experiencing this issue.no click it and press f4 (show dashboard) and release widget.None of the tweaking applications (Onyx, Cocktail, etc.) have this preference, so assume it may be non-existant.IMHO a very handy, instantaneous way to control music playback at home. Unlike with infrared remotes, walls are not an obstacle. :) When first trying this (some 2 years ago), it was one of those tech "wow" moments.Some things still put Firefox above competition: intelligent (learning) address bar autocomplete; huge selection of *good* add-ons (Safari or Chrome don't even come close). Too bad Firefox is slower than Chrome...Though some Firefox features still aren't matched in Chrome, I nowadays find myself mostly using Chrome on OS X because it's just so much faster.why rebooting? a `sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist && sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist` will do fineDoesn't look like he can move to a Mac as get. There isn't any point in installing Windows on a MacBook Pro when you've already got it on another laptop. Accepting this answer.iTerm is even better.At work I have use Word, however I write my text in Pages and then export to Word. Pages is a well crafted product.Awesome when combined with MacFusion.Sadly this shortcut doesn't work in Chrome :-(Was too lazy :PI actually did decrypt a backup that was from a few weeks ago with a program called "iPhone Backup Extractor", and I found the following files in it. oscpcache.sqlite3, keychain-backup.plist, TrustStore.sqlite3, and some other miscellaneous folders. I remember that oscpcache.splite3 and Trustore.sqlite3 and keychain-2.db was in the Keychains folder. Im not sure how to recreate it again.If you have copies of keychain-2.db, oscpcache.splite3, and Trustore.sqlite3 then just copy them back into "/private/var/Keychains/" and you should be good.Thanks for the quick answer.
So, the upgradability of the Mac Pros is realistically only really in terms of HDD, RAM & GPU if you discount the mostly insignificant processing improvement from 2.66 to 2.93. 
I don't know how it is historically, but it seems even less likely then that upgrade paths will exist to newer processors in the future.There is no chance that these machines will be upgradable beyond Westemre. Sandybridge (Intel's next part) uses a completely different socket and adds a 4th memory channel. There might be a few more Westmere SKUs added, but I would not expect any CPU upgrade path.That's an excellent question. I don't understand why some people down voted it.academics use TeX (pronounced 'tech' please! :D)@Carmine: I say no to LB. Quicksilver is free, and *does much more*. Besides, where's the fun without a little application instability?The only file I dont have is keychain-2.dbGood info. Thanks.

TeoThat is the one with your actual data, the others are incidental. The only thing I can think of is if you can somehow force a iTines to reactivate the phone.also note that your linked article is from 2002 :) os x has changd alot since tthen.@reg There's a lot of app launcher out there (I know, Quicksilver is more than that, but still...) and we simply can't have one topic for everyone of them. Besides, Quicksilver is no longer actively developed, since its main developer is now working on Google's Quick Search Bar.Shouldn't this question be a wiki ?I know it was for 2002 so I asked this question otherwise I do whatever he said, but now I have some more questions. 1- in your example you can find "Open" in finder menu and make new option as the exact name action("Open") but what if I can't find "Exact name of menu command" like shortcut for Quick look(no apps no menu no...) or etc.? 2- and also how find what shortcut related to which apps e.g. screen capture (shift+cmd+3) is for what apps?(maybe it was not a good example :( )see the edits! :DI believe there was a period when my MacBook Pro would also behave like this after sleep. I don't remember if I found any solution to this.

I've not had it with 10.6, though.

Perhaps it's time to think about upgrading...+1 for your detailed approach, however I rather not resort to hacking the plist file (I assume the MacPorts distributed one is right, and will be overwritten again when I upgrade it). Turns out it was a simple rights issue.Worked like a charm, thank you!it's unclear if this actually works, though -- and these so called "phonebook sims" are really rare.I asked about this ~year ago at [MacRumors](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=725091) but have so far only got lots of "me, too!" answers and a couple of misunderstandings.+1 Tanx for you answer I got some of my questions but still have little more, indeed I want some command line method and also want know the file that store shortcut.With "Toggle the sidebar" you probably meant "Enable the sidebar" or something like that (i.e., make it visible).Typing worked but pasting didn't - so I think Carmine's answer is better, though it's good to know about this anyway.Thanks for the tag Am1rr3zA; I wanted to add 'package' but it's new, as am I...Thanks for this answer.TM should delete old backups itself. What does consol.app show for processes named backupd?This probably should have been a comment rather an answer.This should be moved to Stackoverflow.@Philip Regan I thought about it, but there's not really much programming involved, to me. If I'd been asking a `cron` question, wouldn't superuser.com be the right place? Since `launchd` is Apple's version of `cron` (and also `daemontools`, and possibly other things), I thought this was my best option.Not really an answer to the specific question I had, but thanks anyway, maybe I'll try it out sometime.After restarting I have, 2.53GB free, no process takes lot of CPU timeThanks, but I think I need to remove the volume again from the privacy tyb.

Using a well designed product will help. That said, I encourage you to try it. It's even better if you try an 'hard' distribution like Gentoo or a *BSD: knowing how it works will help too.On my previous MacBook Pro it was instantaneous, now on this one it takes a few seconds to switch the sound output from the internal speakers to the headphones, but it doesn't freeze the computer in the while.I don't think you can snap in or out a window manager under OS X.It seems weird that there's no free alternative, but this was worth the cost.  I really only use 'Full Screen' and 'Next Monitor', but it's worth it.I can contribute a data point: I had a volume that couldn't be shrunk, and running iDefrag on it (in its default mode) did the trick.yes.

You can track them down by hand (~/Library/Application Support and ~/Library/Preferences are good places to look) or use an app (like AppZapper or anything here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/470/how-do-i-uninstall-a-program-completely-on-a-mac)very nice -- what's the surface of the case like? hard plastic? rubbery? too grippy (i.e. hard to slip into your pocket)?Oh darn. I didn't read the fine print. I had to get the free case within 30 days of purchase of my phone. GrrrrrI prefer xScope, though I hadn't heard about rulers.This.

Again, as you said, not massively convenient though.Wow, awesome tip. Didn't realise you could do this. Fab.Thanks! It looks like the tool should do the right thing, though it's somewhat ugly and doen't have too much functionality compared to Remote app. Some things like getting the (names of the) playlists and search don't work though, which minimizes the usefulness :-/

So any other suggestions?Is there a spot were it lists that?  Also, I dont have any bluetooth headphones, but I guess my mom does and she sits on the couch by me when we're in the living room.  Don't know if that would cause some blue tooth annoying-ness.This looked promising; I downloaded it & tried it, but unfortunately it does not sync notes with Mail.app or iPhone Notes.   :/ There are notes yes (and the UI even looks like the iPhone Notes app), but they are not synced with anything.I've done this successfully with World of Warcraft, so it might work for Skype as well.You get what you pay for.Ok, thanks to all for the answers, I will try the NTFS-3G, I will write the feedback+1 because even though I think Office as a whole is an absolute beast of bloatware, Excel has a place in a lot of my processes. Numbers tries a little *too* hard to be different, I think.Why do people insist on downvoting in these types of questions. That's really in poor taste, I think. If you don't like something, just leave it alone.Hmm.. the price probably depends on the Apple store (e.g. for me prices show in Euros) Which price should we note?Really nice one. Can even play rmvb files !@Juan: yes, prices vary and are in different currencies. I think the most "universal" for our purposes is USD; you can check the US$ prices for each app at http://appshopper.com.

Over here we use the euro too, and I personally chose to put both USD and EUR prices e.g. in [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/706/iphone-apps-you-cant-live-without/708#708).Yeah I've tried it before, just didn't want to pay for such a solution if I can find a satisfactory free one. Thanks for the tip, though!A [VNC client](http://superuser.com/questions/32006/mac-vnc-client-for-controlling-mac-mini-remotely) is of course an option, but I find that's kinda slow/clumsy for controlling iTunes. Compared to a small, dedicated app anyway (like the one for iPhone).@Studer: Why did you remove the `osx` tag? It seems kind of relevant here.Cant get much smaller than the shell script :)If they paid for MobileMe they could locate you, and send you messages, but obviously that isnt important to them, so keep it :)I would like to add that although correct, some javascript extensions use other functionality that IS platform specific. For example an extension I came across which takes a screenshot, and only works on the mac.You can have Mac OS X Server run BIND9 itself (DNS service).I will have to wait a while to see if this works before accepting an answer :)+1 use it more than all other apps combined.I have a similar feeling..I only say it because I had an iPod battery go bad once outside of the warranty and the price to replace it was almost as a new one. I was told that was pretty much Apple's strategy when it came to mobile devices.Deleted my comment because i couldn't format the code.This will piss off anyone who uses your computer that isn't used to that configuration.It appears this suggestion on the link you posted works..


After you get the "this page is outdated" error, click on your email address in the upper right corner, to access your iTunes account. It will prompt you for your password. Once you're on your account page, click Done, and you should be back at the "My App Updates" page. Now, updating all of your apps should work.What makes you think it's Spotlight corruption?I wouldn't give an iPhone to soilders - it needs to be recharged far too often!@Nippysaurus That's pretty weird. Was it an extension that used the official extension API? I really don't know how you would do this using it.Have you tried restoring an older version of that sparsebundle? Like, the one just before your Mac died instead of the one during the time your Mac was dying.I'm sure it has to do with binding the service to a specific IP address for listening, but I don't know enough about that to provide a good answer.@Jonik: Because it's not specifically about `[osx]`, it's about `[itunes]`.@Josh My thought was something with the firewall, as you could just allow/block the port to the service, but I don't know how or if it's even possible with the stock OSX firewallrun `hdiutil attach -nomount -noverify -noautofsck -stdinpass -debug MyImage.sparseimage` and post the debug log. might be helpful.In "System Preferences" -> "Sound" -> "Output" tab. 
See the "Input" tab also.I found that same blog entry just after I posted this question last night, and did what he said. I let the process run overnight, and was able to access the .sparsebundle this morning. Looks like that did the trick!@Josh: That's not true. The question is asking about certain kind of software (for controlling iTunes) **specifically for OS X**. (An `[itunes]` question might well be related to iTunes on Windows; this one is not.)Oh, and the question itself is great! I'd very much like to know about such OS X app too.Glad I could help! Time Capsule is so error-prone - I managed to destroy a backup by copying it to a different disk, wiping the drive, and copying it back!

But you were the first to provide the right answer, so thanks for that ;)@Jonik: Perhaps, but it isn't specifically talking about `[osx]` except as a requirement for the software.This would be individually configurable between user accounts, though, I'm assuming. If you've got multiple users using the same user account, though, then yeah you'd have to take that into consideration for sure.+1 for this.

Or is there something else you want her to do?When I have spotlight re-index the drive, the problem fixes itself.1) Read the serial number on the SIM card. 2) Call the SIM card provider, have them look up that serial and contact the owner with your contact information. 3) Wait for the owner to contact you.Sorry, that isn't what I meant. I want to be able to quickly queue up songs into the iTunes DJI am sharing over Bonjour, but my MBP is not on all the time.  The desktop machine shares over Bonjour as well, and that is always on.  I do all my ripping, conversion, tagging, etc on my MBP.  I want the music on my MBP for when I'm not at home, and I want everything to also be constantly shared at home as well.If I understand you correctly, that's probably going to be hard with a hotkey, because you'd need someway to select the songs you want to add and then hit the hotkey to add them. iTunes DJ does a pretty good job of adding songs automatically for me so it's endless. If you want to delve more into iTunes, you'll need to play with AppleScript..you can start here. http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/info01.phplooks very TextMate'ish. Promising.TextMate shaked the editor world when it arrived. Every new editor needs to compete against it and if you are just a single developer then it's very difficult to catch up. I quit working on my own open source editor and switch entirely to using TextMate. Sorry.The video that nudged me into writing this question, was the keynote published yesterday. I would guess that it used Quicktime?Hell? Sure it takes some time to get used to everything and to be as productive as you were on Windows, but I didn't find it hell at all.

As previous poster said. To make it happened you do need:

Mac OS X Server version
AquaConnect Terminal Server software (depends what version of server you want to use)Hell at this case means "uncomfortable" :)What *bundle* of Gimp for Mac OS X did you choose (where do you get Gimp from) ?Well, I asked that question too, this is a separate problem. Now I can't get Spotlight to index my drive.I would prefer to add them to the front of the queue, but that solution could be workableI got it from here: http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/News/News.html Any hope?No idea. Do you have a FireWire cable with which you can plug the two computers? It's a whole world faster.No, but I think I'll get one. Is there any trick to doing a file transfer via FireWire, or should OSX fallback to using that instead of the ethernet connection. 

As a long term solution though, I'd love to find out why file transfers between the Macs are so slowIt might be worthwhile to explain just what this script is doing (eg. "Basically it's a shell script that parses your bookmarks.html file and writes it out as .webbookmark files in the Spotlight cache -- which is what Safari does with its bookmarks" ripped from the source)These are all formats available *if* you hack your original Apple TV and install Perian and Flip4Mac. Until more is known about the new Apple TV (namely can you even install Perian and will an ARM version of Perian be available for the A4) these won't work at all.How are all the computers connected? You should be seeing about the same speeds between all 3. Is what you're transferring have a very large amount of small files?With a FireWire cable, you can boot your Mac in "Target Mode" (by pressing T before the Apple logo appears), and this will make the other Mac think your targeted Mac is an external drive. It's much faster than network transfer.Do you mean broken links?I bought iDefrag, did a compact defrag and then tried using bootcamp again.  It still gave me the message to back up and then use disk utility to format my drive as a single journaled volume and then restore / try bootcamp again.

They should just change the name to ios weekly.So do I. (filler text)In the future, I suggest just bypassing your router and connecting the computers directly with an ethernet cable if they're both gigabit. I think you'll be impressed with the speed of the transfer.Would a crossover cable be required for that, or can I connect two Macs using a standard ethernet cable?And then you can move around the menus with the arrow keys, press Enter to expand a menu, and again Enter to run a command.I can see there being just far too many issues surrounding privacy and the simple legality of doing this. It would be a much safer idea to have the phone dropped off at the police, AT&T store, or an Apple Store untouched and let them sort it out. I know I'd be bothered by a complete stranger that doesn't work for Apple or AT&T rooting around my phone. Just drop it off and be done with it.I guess it should work with ethernet.
The problem is the Mac Mini can only be accessed via WiFi and there's no other computer to trigger the "wake up" packet.

I guess the only way of doing this is just leave it always sleeping and use the remote or something. I miss good old days when Mac keyboards had a power button for the machine. :(I let it run overnight, drive is now fully indexed, thanks!@Kyle - Does iPad really only have 256mb?

If not, then it's a hardware problem.When I go into the Disk Utility and look at the partition tab for my hard drive it says that it is formatted as "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" and I do only have a single partition.Is this still happening after you did this? http://bit.ly/9zg771Skitch is the reason I switched from Windows to Mac over a year ago (although I continue to be unsure if I'm happy about the switch or not.)Thanks, this works like a charm. The only thing that's annoying is the colors - even though I've changed the ones in Google to match, my iPhone occasionally forgets about a calendar and then assigns it a different color when it learns about it again.Yeah, the monitor has been tested with another source (works fine), and I tested the mini with another display today, and it worked fine. It's absolutely on the side of the computer. I'm not convinced that it's hardware though, since, as I said, it's capable of displaying video from firmware (i.e. Option-booting shows the HDD select screen as normal, and Single User Mode outputs to the display just fine as well). An OS reinstall is next on my list of things to try, but I'm as much curious about *how* this manages to happen as in getting it fixed at this point. :)I have the same problem. Too bad Apple doesn't provide a way to address this. Typical.No, it's not the particular screen model. I misstated. I tested the mini with another display today, and the same exact issue occurred.

I don't think a New User will help as it's losing it's video output as it gets to the login screen.You had good experience with OWC for a MacBook Pro?

I've mapped to something crazy (Cmd-Opt-Shift-P) to Quit, and I'm mapped Cmd-Q to Find.  It shows up correctly in the menu, however, Cmd-Q still quits Firefox.Hmmm.. see me comment below, but that doesn't seem to work in my case.  Does Cmd-Q or Quit have special properties?The machines are an iMac and a Macbook Pro, and using .local makes no difference.@Cleggy Can you see things like iTunes sharing and AFP sharing from one Mac to another? If so, then Bonjour works and I have no idea why appending `.local` doesn't work. If not, then your router's not passing Bonjour packets for some reason, in which case I would suggest getting a different router, as this one is more trouble than it's worth.Using this method is exactly what I did to determine that they had no been added, but this is certainly a good answer, thank you :)Especially as it is the only solution to virtualize Mac OS X (although restricted to Mac hardware only).I'm no longer seeing iTunes sharing (did work with the old router), and AFP sharing only works using the IP address. This may be a course of action investigating further. The router is a relatively new model, so perhaps Bonjour support is currently incomplete or buggy. If I have no joy, I'll nag the manufacturer before returning it.@Cleggy Yeah, with AFP I was wondering if you could see the other computer in Finder automatically. One crazy thing - you mention this is a modem/router, is it possible that each computer is being assigned an *external* IP?Nope. Definitely internal (in the 192.168.2 range). Another odd symptom is that the Mac machines show up in Finder as 'PC Server'. I have emailed Belkin support for clarification on their Bonjour support, but I suspect I may have to take you up on your suggestion, and return it for a more Mac friendly modem/router.Works fine here.

It updates live, so you could try to install the widget, then see if a new message comes up.He means open /Applications/Utilities/Console.app and read the system logs while you proceed with the installation. There might be a relevant error or message that may point you to the right direction. Are you an Administrator? Do you have permissions to install applications? Etc.Has the file been deleted?

I had a feeling there would be some meta-way to turn this off. :-)I would have tagged this as Firewire-800 and RAID but I don't have the rep to make tags and we don't seem to have suitable tags created (yet!)Thanks Louis. I guess I didn't really explain the nature of the data on the drive to begin with - these are archives and backups of files on my laptop, not the 'originals' themselves. I'm not using the raid device *instead* of backup, I'm already using one JBOD to keep my backups on, and as an alternative to copying those backups to a second volume (backup of my backup), I want to use RAID to do that step for me. I appreciate the good advice though!@calavera It's definitely related, though the answer to that question was not a keyboard shortcut, so I'm inclined to keep this question open.If you're looking for an answer to a programming question, please ask on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

I'm not sure the problem is with Finder either, but I was hoping that causing Finder to restart might cause other aspects of the system to realise it needs to be 'awake' again. :-)The computer is already awake (otherwise he wouldn't be able to log in via SSH or use the Shares).Evernote and Pages generally work well for me as well. Haven't tried Penultimate yet but have been looking for a mind-mapping solution for the iPad so will be taking a look shortly.In that case RAIDing them makes perfect sense. The one issue is that since they are separate external enclosures you want to be extra careful about plugging/unplugging them, as doing it willy-nilly could cause the raid to degrade. The setup you have seems like that is not a problem, but just make sure you are careful.I contacted Belkin to see if they supported Bonjour, and here was their response:-

"We understand that you want to know if the Belkin router supports Bonjour protocol.

This is true for most network backup situations, other vendors just use proprietary databases or tar files, in stead of disk image that can browsed by usersWikipedia now says 256MB, and doesn't include the [citation needed].

It just seems a bit expensive, as iPhone apps go: $30 for the app plus $80-100 for the receiver dongle. Still, good answer!Only works for iPod nano (5th gen and newer). Not iPhone.Post Production is fine.  I'll look into each thing you've mentioned.Yep. The Camera app needs a little lock icon.@puri: Yes, though it could have the same hardware.@Daryl: Yes. Otherwise you can use **Chealion**'s solution to manually remove the quarantine flag.What's awful about TextMate's UI? The entire UI is basically just a document window...Yeah, that's true. Although Germany is the only country in Europe where that's the case.I guess my next question would be - does iTunes 10 solve the issue? :-) Running out of ideas unfortunately. Does sound like an odd situation.This application has saved me several times while taking college courses.  Apparently the college I attend thinks Microsoft products are the only products available.I tracked down a 32g 2nd gen iTouch with the newest iOS.  You are correct, it does not have multitasking capabilities.Thanks.  I was hoping keep the auto-lock feature.  Mail seems to be able to fetch the passwords from the keychain and use then while I'm logged in to fetch and deliver my email.  Why can't iCal behave the same way?I suggest re-ordering in rough order of effects. Brightness probably belongs at the top of the list.can it be done via pref pane?Related to this tip, option+any volume key will open the sound system preference pane, and shift+vol up/down will change volume silently (without the little plink sound.)@jdiaz No. There is no option in System Preferences to flush the DNS cache.Do you mean iTunes and is the metadata just in the files(e.g. mp3s) or in some other sytem?@Mark: Question edited for your commentGood idea, mankoff.  I've reordered the best I can, but if anyone has any suggestions let me know.  I've also added a link that has the list with pictures.metadata stored in music not in iTunes,you just have problem in rating and number of play.I could only connect to my mac computers using SMB, because AFP didn't work. Other bonjour provided services such as my shared printer and shared iTunes library also didn't work. I could not ping machines by name, and instead had to ping the IP address directly. Name resolution did work correctly from my Windows 7 based HP laptop and Fusion VM.

When I swapped the Belkin Share out for my old DLink modem/router, all these services were once again available.Another way to put it is that it is kind of like a "history" of what apps were used. With some "multitasking" involved. Just saying :DNike+ works with iPhone 4.@g: Do you mean to type those keys on a connected keyboard? Pretty sure the iPad keyboard does not have the "Option" key?Solely for Apple products?Spotlight allows me to start playing a song in the background without using the mouse. Swapping to iTunes and back would use many more keystrokesYep, just for apple products :) Apart from the apple site of course, because I'm sure apple they screen those reviews.Yep, just apple products like the iMac, iPhone, OS X, etc ...Nike+ works on iPhone 3GS !What Chealion said: Did you go to the MenuMeters pref pane (at the bottom, in the "Other" category in System Preferences) to turn on the meters you'd like?Not on my Iphone 4 iOS 4.1. Maybe this is a setting managed by the exchange administrator? Also the "No Limit" is missing from my list of options.The only thing that springs to mind was that the new router had a different subnet range (192.168.2) to the one it was replacing (192.168.0). All my computers were originally configured using the old router, although I did remove the Ethernet connections from the OSX Network preferences and added them back in again. What I didn't try was to set the new routers subnet range to match the old router. What sealed the deal for me returning the router was Belkin's tech supports complete unwillingness to help when they found out I was running Macs (due to admitted lack of knowledge on their part).What do you mean by missing file songs? Do you have items in your iTunes library that are non-existant of your hard drive?+1 Cool - I didn't realise they'd changed this in iTunes 10. You certainly didn't used to be able to do it in older versions (I've tried before and wondered why they'd be so brain-dead as to prevent you from doing it). Thanks!That is pretty sweet. Is there any reason why I don't want to turn that option on?That's correct. Your Exchange admin can control those settings, so it's possible you're simply not allowed for security reasons or resource management. I'm running an account on an Exchange mailbox and I have all the options available.Couldn't find it quickly looking at their site, but MacUser in their print magazine have an Apple hardware roundup at the back of each issue with tweaked review ratings based on how the product compares here and now, rather than when it was initially reviewed.Working a treat, so far! I had the data already on one disk, so I used that enableRAID then rebuild approach. Thanks for your help!This solved the issue.Ok, thank you Chops.-1 changing ownership of system folders is a bad, bad idea. The whole point of UNIX permissions is to ensure that people can't just break anything they (or a malicious process) wants to. If some change is made necessary by a user's needs, `sudo` is there.+1 for keeping authorizations strict, and altering `$PATH` and `$MANPATH` to include user directories. If the installed programs don't require systemwide installation, it's a much better alternative.(I can't edit my other comment anymore) You should make the difference between system-owned programs and user-owned programs. Do you need to make the binaries available to everyone? If so, you do well to put them in `/usr/local`, and it would be better if this folder's ownership remained to the system (since it's available systemwide). Otherwise, you should install them in directories you own (like `~/bin` and `~/man`, that you'll very likely have to create yourself). What if certain binaries in `/usr/local` depended on the set UID bit?Thanks very much. I'll check into this!@zneak: please read the official wiki http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/installationI remember how much I hated preview back in 10.4 days! Now, thanks to the fact that Quicklook took over some of his duties, I love it :)gcc and other development tools do automatically look in /usr/local so it does affect the systemI note the official Homebrew wiki does say use /usr/local and I would use it with a sudo - @zneaks and my comments re the chown mean we disagree with the wiki.Read better: I _encouraged_ installing there. What I strongly discourage is changing the permissions. Encouraging to install in a systemwide directory but saying that "sudo is dangerous" is borderline nonsensical IMO. Besides, them telling you it's a good idea doesn't automatically make it a good idea.@zneak: `sudo` is more dangerous than changing permissions to a folder and installing as a user insteadxattr worked (with the -d option) but I did need to use sudoI did actually post for advice on a New Zealand geek orientated site (www.geekzone.co.nz), and had tried all the suggestions there before returning the device. Thanks for all your advice, and I'll let you know how I fare with my new one.The problem isn't that it's a "system" folder; it's that it is a "systemwide" folder. Even if there's nothing there, `/usr/local/bin` is still in the default `$PATH` value, and whatever you put there can be used by other users too and should be _trusted_. If the whole `/usr/local/` directory has the same permissions `/usr/local/share/man` currently has on OP's setup, anyone can go and change any binary with a script that does `rm -rf ~`.iPhoto implements a locking mechanism to help prevent two copies of iPhoto from opening a given library at the same time. If you try to open a second instance of iPhoto, you'll get a message saying that the library can't be opened because it's locked, and iPhoto will automatically quit.I use quicksilver and it can't search in pdf by default maybe can do it with some plugin or script.+1 answer to this question is really useful for me.I think @Chea want general answer and he put some sample crash your answer is specific for posted sample.Of course it will, replace 'mother' with 'partner', 'friend', 'enemy' or anyone else who might call.+1 for actually trying to answer the stated question!@Am1rr3zA why don't you put a bounty if you really want it answered? :)Good luck with it, let us know if you run into problems!Your link isn't.whoops.  fixed the link.@Nippysaurus - well, then, your answer's above. Macworld generally does solid reviews of whatever Apple's shipping.@Chops - You're referring to [www.macuser.co.uk](http://www.macuser.co.uk), I presume? Here in the US, it's been a *long* time since I last saw MacUser in print.Feel free to edit - would like a better answer if possible.Are you using Adobe's Adobe Reader plug-in with Safari and Firefox or the built-in OS X PDF viewer?

Too slow to be usable, when trying to import got an error saying images could not be transferred.What if these are old episodes of an existing podcast?Add colums "Plays" or "Last Played" to see what has been listened to.@mankoff: True. That won't show the blue dot, but it will provide some visual indicator+1 Afloat is one of my must-have Mac applicationThanks! It's a great help.Under the View menu, there's the "Show Path Bar" option which achieves a nice result.@John Gietzen No idea for sure. I think it should but give it a try!Have you tried running it from the command line? `softwareupdate --list` to see if it spits out any errors?This is so AWESOME. I didn't know you could do this. Thanks very much.it's like grep :)I like its animation when setting a window to stay on top, however, it doesn't support almost any of the applications I use daily.The question said 'iTunes Windows'Thanks, I found a solution, but I may try some of those later just to see how well they workAt what point in this process did you discover the MBP was unplugged? Is the problem continuing to happen after the MBP is fully recharged?ZOMG!!!  "By default, any hostname ending in .local is treated as a Bonjour host rather than by querying the DNS server entries in Network preferences."  ARGH!!! why couldn't they have picked something like ".bonjour"?  see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2385?viewlocale=en_USugh, you can't simply disable bonjour because of http://tech.karbassi.com/2007/11/06/leopard-turn-off-bonjour-mdnsresponder/does pinging the IP directly work?indeed, changing your domain name appears to be the path of least resistance.  I'm surprised -- apple typically makes very smart decisions in how they choose to implement things.  this is the first implementation decision I've come across which I'd really consider to be quite a boner.  I mean seriously, picking ANYTHING other than ".local" to special-case for bonjour would have been better.@Kyle yes, it does.  I should have thought to mention that.  I'll update the question.Yes, but having the POSIX in the title does away with the icons and extra space that get in the way of longer paths. Usually, I only see the icon folders and the names are either truncated or left out completely. Not terribly useful, really.Awesome.  Is there any way to get the dot to show?@dori Right after I initially realized that the machine was not starting up and that the charge indicator was not on. And yes the problem continues even with the battery charged. I didn't try re-seating the memory until I had verified the battery charge. I can hear that something is 'on' in the machine when the sleep light blinks. Not sure if I'm hearing fans or the drive.I was used to Launchy from Windows world, and found Quicksilver. But after few days, I found that Spotlight works just fine for me and I never use Quicksilver. It was also pretty hard to find shortcut that didn't collide with some other program that I use.@John As far as I can tell, noQuickSilver is much more then simply an application launcher. ;)This is the gallery app I referenced in the question- despite the name of the app, it is not a universal app, and the ipad version just scales up the iphone or runs in a tiny window.Not just Mac though.Yep I tried that too. Just freezes just like the GUIAlso an output from your Console would be helpful to see where the problem might be.I guess I'm using the built-in plug-in - the page displays in the browser window, and as far as I can tell I don't have any Adobe Acrobat Reader plug-in for either - nor can I find anything online that resembles one.  Works just fine on Windows...+1. Would love to know **why**. Of note this has been standard practice with **Finder** since the early 90s if not all the way back. `cp` on the command line merges just fine.There is a link to the SuperUser question at the very top of this question. I did not link directly to "the" answer on SuperUser because It has been constructed from parts of several other answers. I did, however, add links to each partial answer (using that handy "link" button) in the second paragraph of this answer. How many more links do you want? `;)`Before 10.6 (eg. 10.4) it would just change the EXIF Orientation flag. Currently the version in 10.6 (unsure about 10.5's) it just saves it out as another JPG which means information is lost and it doesn't touch the EXIF data.Thanks!  I'll try this.BTW, did you mean to link to a question at superuser.com?  No link in your last sentence.Does this occur on your iMac as well?@Chealion: I do believe you've misspelled "Mail.app" in that tag.@e.James: Oops. Thanks. Fixed that.He would be "upgrading" from the gimped Apple TV OS.  FYI, Apple does in fact sell full, non-"upgrade" licenses.  The Snow Leopard upgrade is for Leopard owners... users of Tiger and previous must buy the "full".  However, from my experience and other peoples' anectodal evidence, the upgrade edition does not care whether you have any version of OS X whatsoever.it's pretty sad isn't it?  such a simple thing that can cause so many headaches... including destroyed data!!!  I think the question is a litte too open-ended though.  Maybe change it to something like "how can I copy with merge rather than replace?"also try posting a similar or identical question on http://ifixit.com.  There are a lot of hardware technician types on there.Been playing with this a lot and I really love it.  I was beginning to think that I would be stuck with the cruel joke that is VLC forever.  This app beats the crap out of VLC for ease of use.  It even seems less buggy.  I can play the same file in both apps and VLC skips and does all kinds of weird crap while Movist just plays the file perfectly.Mmmm... already had Adobe Acrobat downloaded and installed on this Macbook, and updated to the latest version.  Just on the off chance, I deleted that version from the /Applications directory, and downloaded & installed fresh.  Exited and restarted Firefox - zero change in ability to browse that document.  Can you browse the links in that file from your Mac?I have a same problem here since yesterday after update my MBP it's batery just charged 50% after that adapter stop charging and heated so much then yesterday it will not charge anymore and can't turn it on although by adapter attach it.So... now Safari won't open the file at all, nor hand off to Acrobat Reader - just opens a blank window, nothing else.  I'd had some other extensions loaded for being able to open PDFs in the browser window, instead of having to open them in Acrobat Reader.  I disabled those, and now Firefox will open the file and hand off to Reader... but Reader still cannot open any of the file links on that page *except* one... that I'd already downloaded directly to the same directory that the hpr-index.pdf file is in.  So *that* file is where the index is pointing to - in the same local directory.Also worth noting... you can annotate pdfs using Preview. This is useful for all sorts of things; adding simple shapes to highlight/emphasize things, adding (colored) text for note-taking, etc.I really can't stand VLC.  Buggy, extremely difficult to configure, ugly as hades... the only thing it has going for it is the sheer number of different formats it will play.  Why should I have to be an expert in video and audio codecs to configure my player?  Movist beats this one by far.Can't believe this one wasn't mentioned already.  This is indispensable to me with all the crap I put my Macs through :)for your second part of question I must say yes if you update to next firmware it flush every thing and need to jailbreak again.@Chris, sure did.  Fixed.@Martin - Just tried that. Starts to boot up. Then screen goes black.@calavera - Thanks for the ifixit link. Looks like they have a lot of diagnostic and troubleshooting info.I think glyphboard is not available outside the US.Spiritual successor or actual successor?

Updated my answer with how you can access the secondary files but it should technically be working. (Even with just OS X's renderer)@Dori: true, but this really sucks when you have a bunch of folders underneath the folders you want to merge :/Looks like this was it. I could not boot with one of the DIMMS in either slot. Booted with the other DIMM in both slots. Thanks.You should be more clear that this answer was copied and pasted from [Macworld.com](http://www.macworld.com/article/132788/2008/04/spotlight2.html).Its my pleasure :)Thanks for the heads up.

It seems very strange to me to expect that two folders will be merged seamlessly.  As a programmer, I often want to remove old/obsolete files, and a merge would not do that.@Chealion:  When you say "cp on the command line" merges just fine, I was surprised.  But, "cp -R a/* b/" does appear to merge a/subdir into b/subdir in some way.  I'm not sure I trust it.  Note that when you use mv instead of cp, you get an error message.These all look to be Power PC based Mac commands.  My question was meant to be slightly more subtle and look for Intel based vs Power PC based as well.Thanks, so I need to account for this in my app :)You should mention that this was copied and pasted from [an Apple.com support page](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/15638.html).@khedron I learned it merged when I attempted to have it do a replacement and wondered why things went screwy with a project I was working on. It merged perfectly much to my assumption's chagrin.I do too, but shirts only move the fingerprints, not remove them.Havent been having any issues lately, so marking as answer :) Thanks you Studer.Actually most of those work across both architectures and the page is current (March 2010). Other than the Open Firmware specific keys, the Mac Classic specific keys and the Target Disk Mode key that does not work on non-firewire MacBooks regardless of architecture, what isn't covered?@Martin: No, a fresh user still failed :-(Great answer.  I'm using this all the time now, this used to frustrate the hell out of me.@calavera - Ok. So by matched sets they just mean that the voltage and speed are the same?@calavera - I get it now. The retailers just make sure that the specs match. ;~)@wdypdx22: Close... Actually matched sets are designated so by the manufacturer, not the retailer.  A matched set is supposedly tested by the manufacturer to verify that all modules in the set are nearly identical (within some tolerance) in their specs.  Basically it boils down to the fact that a memory module has a set of listed specifications, but variance in the manufacturing process means that not all finished modules will adhere strictly to those specifications (but they'll be close).  So a matched set has been "verfied" to fall within a tolerance for that spec.For your purposes I wouldn't worry about matched sets.  I would just look at the listed specifications.  Just about anything that is by a respected manufacturer (Crucial, OCZ, Kingston, etc) will be close enough to the listed spec that it should work if said listed spec matches with the listed spec of your Apple installed memory.hopefully this doesn't confuse you more...  feel free to ask if it does :)and if you need your original memory's specifications, hopefully there is a serial number or part number and manufacturer on the RAM module itself.  Then you may be able to look up the part number and find the original specs.  These are also shown under "memory" in system profiler, but they're in hex format so you'd have to find a conversion table (probably a site that lists manufacturer codes) on the web.  So you'd look at the details in system profiler for your one good memory module.hahaha sorry for all the spam but I keep thinking of things... basically this all will make you a more informed consumer, but you could always go the easy route and contact OWC (macsales.com) or macmall, etc.  They should be able to provide you with a module that they know will work with your current module.  They'll basicallly have already done all the legwork we discussed here :)I just answered your question on superuser. Too little, too late? oh well :PWill do. Today I ordered the DGN3500, after reading a positive review of it on a Mac website. The only downside was the setup wizard software is Windows only, but the routers web interface also has a setup wizard, and I'm not one to shy away from a bit of tinkering anyway :-)Sadly, I don't believe System Prefs can set keyboard shortcuts to launch apps.@calavera - Cool. Thanks for all the info.@Dori: wow, you're right.  That's what I get for assuming... I've seen the application shortcuts section in keyboard shortcuts and assumed it would allow me to create one for launching an application.  I just never tried it since I always use spotlight.

But you are correct that it does not have HDR.@3rdparty, that would probably happen only after this site is out of beta... (though I don't know what the exact plan is with regard to these overlapping sites).iPhone 3GS didn't either.

I know the built-in functionality is a buggy, that's why I added links to 3rd-party softwares.I do not have access to the iTunes I used to originally activate the phone.Have a look @ this question : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1192/is-it-possible-to-use-time-machine-on-a-shared-usb-hardriveThis is how Homebrew is meant to be used. Some people may disagree but the lead developer says to do things that way.Excellent. Could perhaps have been corruption in preferences or something, but I'm glad it's fixed either way. Be sure to mark as answered if you're happy with the solution :-) (Albeit lucky)This also works in open/save windowsAnother alternative I can highly recommend: [Dupin](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/dupin.php)Does anything appear in the All Messages section of Console.app when you do this?Do you have any extra audio devices?

Personally I also like to have Dashboard bound to one corner and screen blanking (Put Display to Sleep) to another.Funny, I checked the same thing when playing around with `say` yesterday...certainly a nice usability feat!honestly i got really frustrated with cyberduck due to little but important details (for example your bookmarks aren't sortable, no sidebyside view local/remote, ...) and switched to Transmit. Haven't looked back since ...I've actually read lots of very critical reviews (of Apple products) at Apple online store too, so I wouldn't dis it too much.I've never had luck with VLC.

I've heard the demand for used, out-of-contract iPhones is high.I've actually successfully sold all three of my prior iPhones on eBay (one 2G and two 3G's) -- but for me, the time, effort, and trouble isn't worth it for the price premium over Radio Shack's offer.  Especially for items like iPhones, there's a non-trivial risk of fraud on eBay; and even if you're eventually made right, the resolution process can be incredibly painful.It's in pristine condition and I would sell it for $350. Write me at chris@abichandani.com if you are interested.An old SIM may no longer be associated with an active line, but my understanding is that it's not actually deactivated -- specifically, if you stick it in a random phone, it will enable you to dial 911 (which you cannot do without a SIM).  I don't really understand how much information it retains, but the fact that it's functional has always led me to remove them before selling, to be safe.Neat idea. But for a perfect condition 32GB 3Gs with all cables, etc, they will pay only $168.I've been noticing the same thing on my 3G since upgrading to iOS4.  Mail and Messages sometimes take quite a while to fully load.Multitasking is not supported on the iPhone 3G.  It is only supported on the 3GS and 4.Ah, didn't know that. Thanks.Does deleting them from the multi-task bar close the app?  It seems that if I've been using the phone for a while since a reset,  deleting an icon, slids another into view,  it seems that there may be 15 or 16 programs running,  is there a way to tell the phone, "I'm done with this app, don't put it in the background" without the delete step? Kinda like the difference between minimize and close on the desktop>?The sounds more like a band-aid than a permanent fix.  I will try it out and monitor my phone's performance over the next few days.I still don't get why resetting **twice** it's better than one reset.Can you comment how is the performance after several days and with all the apps again on board?Thanks, that solved the issue.  You should update the path to Settings->General->Home Button->Spotlight SearchThanks very much Rich, huge improvement with this tip.  Evernote in particular loads dramatically faster now.Given the confusion below, you may want to clarify the title ("Make iPhone clock alarm...")I set alarms all the time, and sometimes miss them because I leave my phone on vibrate instead of sound lol. With the Timer, I'm not sure that's an option, but Alarm should obey the vibrate on/off switch.@pinko:  Thanks, I edited in some clarification.Can you clarify what you mean by "multitasking keeps me checking for open apps"?  Are you worried about performance or battery life, and tired of trying to make sure nothing needless is running?  Or is there some kind of background app that is specifically bothering you?This is mostly true. However, I got a "low memory" warning when trying to play Rock Band on my iPhone 4 that would only disappear once I manually quit all the apps I had open.So install a taskkiller @Kyle, but don't go blaming faulty programming on multitasking ;-) It's a bug of the power draining apps, not the OSI have to agree with @Kyle here, I won't blame multitasking but fact is some apps are just badly developed, If only Apple had foreseen this and given us a kill all button. Clearly they don't have enough manpower to do memory leak analysis on all apps.Any others have success?  I'd love to make this a resource for any configuration that works.Are your phones iPhones?  I had a HTC Tilt that worked great...  The lack of volume control for iPhone makes it troublesome with some streaming audio devices.  If you could provide the specific model of stereo it would be helpful.Yes we both have iPhones. I think the sound quality is pretty good. She's got a 2004 Explorer. The only thing is the guys at Best Buy did a bad job installing, so the radio rattled. I had to secure the dashkit myself to stop the loud rattling sound during calls when she hit a bump or something. The guy in this post (http://gadgets.stackexchange.com/questions/137/looking-for-a-high-quality-bluetooth-headunit) has a similar radio, but hates it though.Thomas is correct, you must backup, not simply sync as I mentioned.Is this too subjective?Sometimes I want a Babysmash like app for IPhone...Made this question a wiki as it is subjective and there are no 'correct' answers.Is that 'Bubble Popper' (There is no 'Bubble Wrap' in the App store).

The free version of 'Bubble Popper' links to premium rate phone lines - so best avoided!There is a free (no ads) version called "Bubble Snap". Seems ok, didn't keep my interest for long :)My favourite general suggestion - but lots of other good ideas.What software do u have? It should be possible.I think 3rd party is correct and the radio does not work with Bell Canada's network.aah ok. I didn't realize Bell Canada was CDMA and not GSM.Can you clarify what you mean by "via voice command"?  Do you mean from *any application* (i.e., as an OS-wide function that preempts whatever else you're running)?  From the home screen?  Or just speaking the podcast name from within a dedicated podcast app?Good question. I think I mean by any application, but what I had in mind when I asked it is via the iphone voice command control, which seems to basically power either the phone or ipod applications from what I can tell. The podcasts I want played are in the iPod, but I could move them if it would help.I thought about doing this as an interim solution, though remembering to change it back when I _can_ be disturbed is not something I do reliably :/I do not see the point of restarting the iPhone regularly. In my expereince it works normally and it is not slowing down or anything. 

The top button is putting the device in sleep mode.To perform a "hard" reset, you keep holding the Home and Sleep/Wake buttons until it reboots itself.  You do not slide the red power off toggle switchResetting to factory defaults and reconfiguring has solved the issue for me.You'll also have direct transfer of files from iTunes to the applications that have enabled it, and the choice of open files with certain applications.

I personally find the update very convenient because of the many small improvements, specially now that I have solved the speed issues I initially had.3.2 is iPad only. 3.1.3 is the previous iPhone version :-)Ahh, I think I meant 3.1.2 (changed)+1. I upgraded to 4.0 and experienced how painfully slow it was. I've downgraded again and I'm happy. I have no need at all for the new features -- folders, single mailbox, etc. -- that's all just bloat to me. I'm sure v4.x is great on faster devices though.I'm looking for something similar as well. Some apps, like Boxcar for twitter updates etc allow you to set a "quiet time" when you don't get notifications, but I haven't found anything similar for Mail (or notifications in general).+1 for a good question! Some Android phones sense when they're lying face-down and automatically go into total-silent-mode which is different from when they're lying face-up. Why-oh-why is this missing in iOS? The phone would need to check its position only when it wants to sound an alert.For the record, what I've ended up doing is just preventing an alert from sounding when mail is retrieved. i.e. turning off Settings->Sounds->New Mail.It may also be worth turning notifications off while you're at it, but that doesn't do much about the mail settings.+1 for airplane mode. This turns off the cell phone reception too, so it should prevent calls and text messages too!O2 will also take it back: http://www.o2recycle.co.uk/Good question; bad grammar. "With included documentation as *spare* as Apple's, *there are* plenty of them."Ooops, changed :)Should probably be community wiki, since you make a list of features.For reference, all useful answers from the previous Super User question [Hidden features of the iPhone](http://superuser.com/questions/5940/hidden-features-of-the-iphone) (now deleted) have been copied to this question.Aren't ALL of the features undocumented? I've never heard of a documented iPhone feature. It is intuitive, who needs manuals, right? (pffft)When you ask users to contribute to a list of answers, the question should be community wiki. I converted this question.Nice cut and paste job from SU Gnoupi, thanks :)Not on my iPhone. Double-home goes to phone favourites, or iPod controls if it's playing. Pressing home once when you're already on the home screen goes to the search page.

There is a jailbreak app that puts recent apps on the search page, I have no idea what it's called (even though I'm running it).This is an iOS4 featureMake that iOS4 running on a 3GS or aboveIt is iOS4, edited my answer to reflect - gimme back that vote ;)Gave you mine.           <3 comment length restrictions.  <3 1 comment per 15 seconds restriction too. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15But is this feature hidden at all? This is shown in presentation videos on the apple website ...It's not necessarily a iPhone feature; it's more of a feature that many applications have, right?Actually, it is built in to the standard table-view control provided by iOS, so developers don't have to do anything special to make it happen.  Thus, practically any application that has a "scrolling list" will have this feature, unless the developer really screwed up.The same is true for the shift key; press-slide-release instead of tap-tap to get an uppercase letter.duplicate of my answerYou can't access the Field Test Mode in iOS4.And triple-tap to zoom out. When you use this double/triple-tap, you jump from one true scale to the next, avoiding muddy images that occur in between true scale steps.Only works when accessing the Contacts through the Phone app. In the Contacts app itself, your number is not displayed.holding down the .com key will also display country-specific extensions for your locale e.g. .co.ukAnd if it's not currently playing, press Home *thrice* to get the same controls.(Does not work on my iPod Touch 2nd Gen with iOS 4.) Sorry, it DOES work, but only if you activate scroll lock in the keyboard settings (as posted somewhere below).Also auto-capitalizes the first letter of the next sentence.You mean three-finger-tap, not two-finger.2-finger tap on maps to zoom out. I do mean 2. 3-finger tap doesn't do anything on maps on my iPhone.fairly obvious 'feature'double tapping shift leaves it active to save you a bit of RSI@3rdparty -- Not obvious to me; I never knew thatThat's usual behaviour for modern cell phones. The last 2 or 3 phones i have been using could do that.Do you mean it literally says "Unknown Sender?" Or the number is just unfamiliar to you?This answered it perfectly. Thanks, I hadn't spotted this.No prob. Glad to helpThis should be a Community Wiki question as there is no one specific "best" answerNice app, but a free version to see if their algorithm is any good would encourage me to try it more...I've found it useful (did buy/dl some apps based on that and was happy with results), but not more powerful that the App Store "genius" functionality.

For example, it missed that Sword & Poker 2 came out; I was waiting for the sequel after loving the first, and only found out about it when I recommended the first one to a friend and they told me there were two versions.Awesome Kyle, thanx!Are you jailbroken? I've played around in the AddressBook database file. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to its "organization" though. If you're still interested, I could look up the location of the database in the filesystem. I'm not sure how to speed up the SMS app though. Sounds like a fun project though. I wouldn't mind experimenting with my 3G as well.What version of the iOS are you currently running?The SMS database seems to be located at /var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db. You think deleting old records from it will speed up the SMS app? Am I the only one feeling it slow to launch?

I'm running a JB iPhone 3G, iOS 3.0.1.Thanks! That's kinda what I thought (that there was nothing compatible with BBM). From what I've been reading, doesn't seem like anyone will be able to do so, but even if there was a universal app that all smartphones could use (even Blackberry users in place of/ in addition to BBM) would be cool.I believe 2 or 3 of the ones I listed above ALSO have Blackberry versions - which is helpful if you can convince your BB friends to install and use it :)Both PhoneView and iTunes don't detect that a phone is connected.Already did, they referred me to a hard drive recovery company. Thanks though.I regularly create notes when I'm working at my computer. It's a lot faster than typing them into the iTouch screen.I'd also add a question about how secure this erase procedure is... (i.e. is the data still stored on the phone's hard drive or not?)No, the Erase All Content and Settings option scrubs the flash drive completely. That's why it takes quite a while to finish. In early versions of the OS it only did a delete which left the actual data on the drive, but that was changed in OS 2.1 or 3.Are these files protected by DRM?Nope. No copyright protection.Should this go on superuser instead?you are the man. works beautifully. thanks!It also converts whole folders of files in one go, and you don't have to add the files to it's library for this to work either.Cool. I didn't know iTunes did WMA conversion. I have a MacBook, but I'm on my Windows laptop at work, which doesn't have iTunes. Thanks for the tip!Turns out my car does NOT support A2DP.  Too bad.I see you had ask it on webapps, but it is probably more appropriate on this site. http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/3486/is-there-a-way-to-upload-higher-resolution-videos-to-youtube-or-any-video-sharinThe conventional wisdom is that it'll be released once iOS 4.1 is released (since it's been seeded to developers). No sense releasing it and giving Apple a chance to plug any holes any faster than necessary.This answer should be deleted/ignored, as it is no longer true.Holy crap that is awesome.Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work with Google Apps accounts for a hosted domain. At least, I haven't been able to find a set of settings that will work for my email account. It verifies the account information successfully but when I go into Mail it says it can't connect.@DougC, this works for Google Apps with hosted domains too. I'm using that with great success. Open a new question here, add all possible details, and let's see if we can get you aboard ActiveSync!Another name for the character is [grave accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent).Ouch. Especially in the iPhone world where opening up Mail means closing whatever app I'm in, which may or may not save its state... I'm pretty sure this answer is correct though.Thanks for your answer. I'm aware that I have to re-establish the connection. My problem is if I'm cross booting, the iPhone is not recognized by OSX or Win7.Not if bought some on the phone and some at your desk.Apps that are bought on your phone will show up in iTunes after syncing.You can ask your meta question on http://meta.gadgets.stackexchange.com, but personally I would leave the tags as they are and elaborate on the question. What do you mean by outliner app? What features are you looking for? etc.I mean something that has all the normal outliner features, with demotion and promotion of headings and subheadings, etc.
The only other requirement I can think of is that it has a web/desktop client that syncs with the iPhone app. Cheers :)From what I have read, Evernote is not suited at all to outlining. Quoting from a user: 'Outline better. For the love of dog, why can't I tab, shift-tab for indenting just like nearly every other outlining program out there?'The problem is that I want to queue up songs on the fly. I will check out on the go playlists however@Casebash: This is the only way to do it.This actually works pretty well. Songs added are added to the end and you can easily clear itAlso want to add that if you have an existing AT&T sim with no data plan and you put it in a smart phone like an iPhone or Android phone AT&T will require you get a data plan and will add one for you (they act as if it's a favor).what device is the touchscreen on?@Rich I'd assume iPhone, that's what the question is tagged@Kyle clever cleverI meant the phone itself, since when I give the hard drive recovery company my phone, they only have access to the phone. That's useful information though, so you should keep it. However, I'm wondering which file extension is used to store these SQLite databases on the phone?Taking a random browse through the filesystem on my iPhone, I see `.sql`, `.sqlite`, and `.sqlite3` files; but note, however, that these filenames are all at the developers' discretion. I'm afraid I don't know what file extension is used for data stores based on Core Data. That being said, this isn't necessarily going to get you anything useful, because it's only part of what makes up a given application; I'm curious why you wouldn't simply have everything restored?@esm: The recovery company simply gives you a cd-rom with the files they were able to recover. They won't restore the phone since something is wrong with the OS.I use Exchange (Google Sync) for Mail, Contacts, and Calendar.  The  Mail app is fine for reading, but it does lack the ability to permanently delete messages, etc (known limitations).  For organizing, I jump over to Safari and use the excellent mobile version of GMail.Any particular reason why you don't want the first-party cable?Sorry, should have clarified that -- would prefer not spending $20 on the official cable, when I've been able to get compatible aftermarket cables for <$4 in the past (pre-iPhone4).Note that this problem also occurs with some car-connection kits and stereo systems, where replacement with official Apple cable is not an easy option.Alternatively, you could probably shave a few mm off of the inside of the bumper.  But I'd rather mutilate the cables than the bumper.My phone is not jailbroken :). I followed your answer and checked usage - I left phone with locked screen for a night, at the morning still no data was used - so seems it downloads nothing by itself! Thanks :)No prob. Glad to help!+1 for Rock Hard Awesome.Do you need _mobile_ access, or would WiFi at a public access point be OK?  You might have to buy a cup of coffee or two...needs to be mobile access.Thinking about going with an AT&T iPad MicroSIM - $15 for 250mb.  Curious how easy it will be to walk into an AT&T store and pay cash (or prepaid credit card) for an iPad MicroSIM.  Would then need the custom APN settings to use in the iPhoneAnother related question: http://gadgets.stackexchange.com/questions/57/is-there-any-way-to-speed-up-my-iphone-3g-since-upgrading-to-ios4

I would also be interested to see some figures if they exist on this, I've definitely noticed my 3G becoming more sluggish since the 4.0 upgrade.Rich Seller posted a nice answer to my question about speeding up the iPhone 3G using iOS4.I found it too painful to use after updating to iOS4. Gave it a go for a couple of weeks, then reverted. On reinstalling iOS3, I felt like I had a new phone again. I have no metrics for the slowdown, but everything was just 'stodgy'.That video is awesome.  That is exactly how my iPhone was performing when I upgraded to iOS 4.0The DHR worked for a little while for me, but things eventually reverted to incredibly slow again. Even after the DHR, it was still slower that iOS3(Personally I don't fancy the bumpers, or any of the patterned cases, so it's down to the Incase Snap Case vs Belkin Shield Micra, I can't see much difference between them. But it would be good to find a comparison of all)Blue-tac in bottom right is an optional extra ;)I just updated a iPod touch and it all worked without losing music or photosThey are already marked as iTunes U in the media kindI have "iTunes U" hidden under the General tab of the Preferences dialog. If the category isn't visible, it might cause the episode to show up elsewhere.

I'd try 
  - editing your library, resyncing and rebooting the iPhone a couple of times to see if the Music app rebuilds the library (my library needed this after troubleshooting another question yesterday). 
  - I'd update to the latest version of iTunes. 
  - I'd try switching the Media Kind (not genre) to podcast and see if it shows up with your podcasts and then change it back. 

If none of that works I'd try filing a bug with Apple.Just to reiterate without it getting lost, people often mistake Genre for Media Kind. Genre is a standard IDV3 tag, and won't move your media. The Media Kind seems more internal to iTunes and will properly categorize.The Remote app has been reset and will not even make the initial connection.Unfourtunatly I don't have a working legacy router.warning: this *may* not work with DRMed songs you originally bought from iTunes. In the 3 songs I used, they were all from other sources, like Amazon MP3, etc.As far as Step 5 goes, there should also be an option on the right-click menu in iTunes (for example "Show in Finder" on a Mac)Have you recently downgraded from a previous OS?@snicker Won't the restore insall iOS4? Also, what about my data?@amir: You can download older versions of iOS, and if you press shift (or option on mac) and the restore button you can select a different IPSW. You can use google to find older IPSWs, like 3.1.3@snicker: He has a 3GS. If he doesn't have his SHSH on file with Cydia, he can't restore to 3.1.3.@Amir If you use iOS4 you can still jailbreak as of today ( http://jailbreakme.com )@Macha thanks! this worked for me. If you post this as an answer I'll accept.@Amir: Posted .wow that's a bit.. hardcore. :) I had thought about cases which optionally allowed blocking the home button, but that seems like an odd feature for a case to have.A less hardcore option would be to find a case where you could possibly "flip" the iphone inside of it: I bought some cheap iphone wallet at a mall kiosk that you can do this in to obscure the home button.ooh, that's a good idea -- much cheaper than the fancy Pelican case. Get a cheap case and reverse it.Have you tried uploading an iPhone screenshot to Flickr or Picasa? That should bring through any geo tags the pic has.When you download the image to your computer you can check it's metadata (cmd+I in OSX) to see if there is any GPS coordinates in the EXIF headersI tried that, and didn't see any EXIF data.Ditto, I was able to do the same in iOS4 on an iPhone4.Thanks for the info guys. Mine still won't work though. I filed a bug report. Strange.*Can someone add the 'jabber' tag to this?*@Gnoupi your wish etc. etc.This is what Apple told me to do. Just don't know anyone with one!!! Thanks anywayThanks yea I've too just read that! Thing is, I don't want to destroy my current SIM, just want to activate this phone. I've just ordered a cheap micro SIM so I will try that. Just didn't want to wait! Thankso2 told me that they didn't sell them, but I've found one online! I will just have to wait! My iPhone 4 is doing a good job at being a paper weight for now!That app is called MyWireless. It's very useful.Unfortunatel MyWireless is only available on the US iTunes Store .. makes sense though, since it is (or seems to be) an AT&T specific app.@th3dude Yes, indeed, sometimes I was on 3G, sometimes I was on wifi, if the usage tracks only 3G then it is even better - easier to know how much I used from my limit :-)

@lexu That explains why I couldn't find it in AppStore/Itunes :) Thanks! :)Nice! +1 for that. Now we only still need to see the full title before downloading an episode directly with the iPhone/iPod with iTunes. Any ideas, Nike2? ;)I have not found any way to see the full title yet when downloading. For that I use iTunes. =/Thanks. Seems like this is the only way to see full title for now. And it appears that Apple's aware of this 'full title' issue on iPod app. I don't think it shows confirmation for swipe to delete in any other Apple apps like mail and messages. Hopefully they will do something different like auto scrolling text on following iOS updates.I only see description. I don't see full title on my iOS 4.(to an Epson PX710 all-in-one in my case)for what phone/device?Why are you syncing to multiple computers? You might try to find some other way to accomplish your goals, without fighting with iTunes all the time.Perfect JohnFX. "Transfer my purchases" copied all my paid applications & books then all I needed to do was then tick "Manually manage music and Videos" and I could manually copy Music and videos by dragging them into the iPhone. NICE!Do you want it to be an IR remote, correct?It's dead on the iPhone too. I think it is just Twitter being crap and not testing their app on all platforms before submitting to Apple. Unfortunately, this is quite common in Apple App-land - more than a few talented but still amateur programmers who don't understand the phrase 'legacy support'Update is available now.Will try again. Thanks.Haven't had a chance to call again. Thanks for the suggestion. As for IMEI, it was visible on the iPhone settings before I called up. It doesn't seem to do anything. Is it some other setting?`Apple should do something to easily bring up and dismiss keyboard...`  Yup.  It's downright annoying when you need to read a long text message.What are you calling "normal video calling"? VoIP stuff like Skype, or the original 3G stuff that never took off? (IMHO because the networks overcharged for it)"The original 3G stuff" wouldn't be a fair comparison because Facetime isn't 3G but only wifi.This would be more helpful if Skype actually offered video calling on the phone (and would actually be a viable alternative to FaceTime).@Adam, you're right. I was confusing Skype with Fring which does offer video calling: http://www.fring.com/blog/?p=2276thanks, this works for now until a better solution comes aroundHave you checked your iTunes purchase history to see if the charges on your credit card are associated with your account or if someone just stole your credit card number?Well, it seems that maybe someone stole my credit card number and used it to charge iTunes, which would be a very strange thing for them to do, imho, unless they stole my credit card number from iTunes in the first place@Mechko: Why would that be a strange thing for them to do? Thieves don't want music?well they wouldn't want 40 copies of the same 160 songs/apps on 40 different accounts.  But if they managed to actually STEAL my credit card details through iTunes, I would imagine that they would siphon the money elsehow so as not to draw attention to their potentially profitable exploit.On it.  Except I'm overseas.... :(that shouldn't stop you. most credit card companies have toll numbers that they let you call collect, or local numbers in many countries that are free or cheap to call. or log in to the web page of your credit card and dispute it from there.nhocr is not very good but unfortunately yes, it seems to be the best open source Japanese OCR library so far: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2557743That would by definition remove all my apps and data, wouldn't it?  How could I restore them after the reset?That's the down side - you'd have to do it manually. You could selectively add some stuff back in the iTunes options before you sync. Like you could only sync address book instead of all apps or something.Good question. Maybe better for Stack Overflow though...I'm not sure.The intended audience for this list is iPhone users, not developers.Handbrake ftw..Handbrake ftl.. doesn't work with MKV + embedded subsI encode MKV all the time in Handbrake. . . but not with subs. Hmmm I didn't know that.How can I import incompatible video files into iTunes anf then move them to my iPhone? Everytime I try to drop an avi file into iTunes, I get the "forbidden" mouse cursor.@Martin - Once you get yxplayer, go to iTunes, go to your iphone/ipad on the left tree, and choose the "Apps" tab from the top. Scroll down a bit to "File Sharing" (that says "Documents" right under it), and click "yxplayer" from the list of apps. Then you can transfer documents from your computer (though you need to use another tool to transfer folders).  Yeah, it's not that discoverable a feature, but Apple doesn't like things that aren't Apple.There is no "File Sharing" section in the Apps tab. Does the iPhone need to be jailbroken for that?@Martin - No it doesn't need to be jailbroken. A picture says 1000 words; I made a guide: http://nv3wrg.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pYB8jO58xlRA2GUJBVxkQGGn3XavcPplPGKMemWQn7Bk6bxAYNYcaX5dR9wLxDJFH47adWdmO7Z2_rAprAcHQfFlpafL4dwsz/itunes_ui_sucks.png?psid=1Thank you very much, Robert (+1 for the tutorial). In now know, why I don't see the file sharing section. At the time I asked before, the app was not yet installed, but only downloadad. And when I tried to install it, I had to face the fact that it cannot be installed on my iPod touch. Shame on me. The iPhone is ordered, and I will definitely try this app.Have you ever been able to connect to a WLAN at all? Or did you never succeed?And what are the specs on the WiFi network you want to connect to? (i.e security)Yes, I`ve been able to connect before but now it can't find any network (not from home or office, sometimes it does but it says something like "unable to connect") I had 3.1.2 before, 2 hours ago 4.0.2 now I have 3.1.2 again jailbreak with redsnow same thing. I can see the wifi mac address so I guess is not a hardware problem (once again sometimes sees the networks but it can't connect) 
@Thomas is not the security, I disabled it nothing, with WPA nothing, router reset, iphone network reset still nothing...Was the iPhone already jailbroken when you successfully connected to your router?Yes it was, with blackrain and after 5 days or so, dead.So currently, you're on 3.1.2, correct? When you downgraded, did you use a stock firmware, or did you just put the redsn0w image on there right away?I restored with original (stock).Hmm.....I'll keep researching and let you know if I find anything newYesterday when I tried again to see if it finds any network, it did (my home wifi) but guess what my internet did not work lol, but the device successfully connected 3 times, when I tried the 4th time it did not work anymore... This is some weird...It seems there is something, something that you wont believe...
Here's the solution:
You need one ****ed up iphone, one refrigerator.
Take the iphone put it in the refrigerator (a/c) leave it for 5 minutes, and wow...it works. And I'm not making any jokes.

But there`s a problem, when the iphone get's some heat again...boom no wifi (again) So is a heating issue, if you guys know any permanent fixes to that let me know. (like making some small holes in the back of the device, i'm kidding now).LOL! Man, take it to the Apple StoreIt worked, I mean it. We don't have something like that in Romania... Just resellers and they suck. It seems that the wireless chip is fried... The a/c "fix" works only till the device get's heat again. (I just wanted to test the heat possibility and I was right.)Resent wont work. I already did a network reset, then a full reset same thing...I already did that, nothing. I downgraded from 4.0.2 to 3.1.2 same thing.Thanks for your reply. I started to notice that it happened to 
me when I change wifi network.

see only half the comment and this is the reason why I replied that way. 

Solution 1) worked so far. Hopefully the problem  will not appear again.yes this is a really common problem too bad it wont work for me too :(yes, thanks... this solution worked for me
Do you know what exactly happen during network reset?Thanks again. I wonder why this tricks solves the problem that I had, since I tried to reboot but it was not enough. 
Probably it is related with the permission of some special files.Thanks, actually it seems to happen more on the browser in Echofon (which is based on Safari) than it does in Safari itself. But you're right, it seems the font size is fixed but the content width isn't.Thanks all, I've bought the blackberry and waterproof headphones (as they're quite inexpensive) and will test out to see which one fits best (and will mark as answered appropriately).Reviews say the padding keeps falling off... what are your experiences with that?  Price is definitely right, almost disposable at that price.Ya, the padding falls off pretty fast.  Mostly because I carry them in my pocket.  However, even without the padding I do not find them uncomfortable.I ordered 4 in my last purchase.  The first pair, I popped one right off while holding it in my pocket.  The second pair (that I am currently using) the padding came off, but are otherwise fine. 

As you not.  At under $3, they are basically disposable, and since they last a month or three each, still reasonable.The most helpful review (critical) on the Amazon page: http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-S9-HD-Headset-Adapter-Gloss/dp/B001EKQQ5S
seems to indicate it's not good for jogging or sweat resistance.  Also the non-replaceable battery and short cycle-life make me wary.  How did the 'phones work out for you, and how long have you had them?Great idea... I might be happy to ditch microphone if waterproofing keeps the headphones free of my sweat.Chose this answer because I bought some, they fit and although they're not as comfortable, do a pretty good job.I sync with Google Calendar using Exchange. The color on Google Cal does not transfer over to iPhone cal.That's a pity. Just tried it with MobileMe, and it worked. Too bad that it is not for free.Are you jailbroken?The other day i saw "Locale for Android". That's way cool, but sadly there is no way to get such a thing for the iPhone (at least non-jailbroken as mine is).Since changing your settings did you get any new badges? Perhaps they are old alerts that just haven't cleared.Glad you got it resolved lolAnd be careful if you have a jailbroken device; there won't be a jailbreak for 4.0.2 at all.The solution can be automated and scripted, but it would required SQL knowledge. If you broke the steps down and posted each as a question on a *.stackexchange.com site I bet you could get it done for you...Can't remember the last time I drove a car with a cassette deck!The low-end radios in a lot of rentals still have tape decks.  I can't remember using a cassette deck for anything other than an adapter in the past 5 years.I love Evernote, but I don't think it syncs with Google Docs?Nope, but to the best of my knowledge (which based on the answer below me isn't that good) there isn't anything that syncs google docs.  Evernote is already established as a very portable document syncing system.however the IPod charger may have a higher running cost then a iPhone charger.Can't you just use email instead? Same thing as fax, just without the need for analog.This seems pretty subjective.You should post a link to the product you are using.What was a... Never mind :pUpdate:  After several weeks, I did notice a couple of very minor scratches.  I found a  reasonably priced Vivitar iPad screen protector ($12 at my local Office Depot), and managed to apply it without any bubbles or dust.  SO far, I have not taken it off.Thanks for the tip on SquareTrade - the fact they cover accidental breakage is a big advantage.Would you mind to add comment why this and @Kristopher Johnson answer was down-voted ? The question was about opinions on worth of Apple Care, and I believe both answers did cover.I appreciate your answer.  Not sure who down voted it.My apologies; I think it was me, which is bad form since I had a competing answer in the mix.  My reasoning, however was that they were both purely anecdotal experiences, rather than a reasoned framework for making the decision.

There are tons of people who have bought warranties or not, and tons of people who have had a loss or not.  One essentially random personal experience tells you very little.  Many 100s might allow you to see some trends, but that's not going to happen, so "my macbook broke; mine didn't" answers are not helpful, IMHO--even if they were offered with the best intentions.Wouldn't pirated and "unapproved" apps be considered the same thing?Pirated = app-store apps for free. Unapproved = not in the app storeThis answer sounds incredibly biased.  Being able to run pirated apps is not the #1 reason to jailbreak.  In fact, it never even occurs to most of the people I talk about jailbreaking with.  Also, do you have evidence that a jailbreak has bricked a device?@Stuart Branham - Jailbreaking is modifying the OS, anytime you do something like that there is the possibility of bricking.  So even if there's no evidence of it bricking, the possibility still exists.@Stuart Branham I'm not sure what you even mean by "biased"--I have no agenda and the OP's question is inherently subjective.  But everyone I know who's jailbroken their phone has at least one pirated app installed.  YMMV.  (And yes, I have *personally* bricked a 3GS through jailbreaking--it worked great for months, then when I wanted to sell it, I selected "erase all settings & data" and it's never successfully booted again, even into recovery mode.  Sucks to be me.)I understand that some think that these kind of questions are subjective and argumentative. But I believe that it can provide value for actual iPad usersThe bluetooth MAC is here as well if you ever need it.Kyle is correct. The iPad MAC addresses (for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) are in Settings->General->AboutDavid, thanks for the link and the article. I will give it a try. I figured that on Windows there is an "Automatically Add to iTunes" folder in my library where I can throw the files and they will be automatically entered to my iTunes libraryIs there an official iPad preset for Handbrake?I don't believe there is.  If you're wanting to use a preset, the AppleTV preset looks like it would fit the bill.This belongs on SuperUser@dani this is allowed here because the focus is on the gadget, not the PC. Some gadgets interface with the PC..Isn't that a symbolic link since Vista? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_linkI tried that but it didn't work.  Windows Live Sync still began syncing the contents of the junction point (which I thought was very strange and possibly an issue with Windows Live Sync).That would require some fancy footwork on the USB end of things, and I'm not clear that the current APIs allow iPad programs to get that low-level yet. You might need to look in the non-apple app stores.I don't think anyone outside Apple really knowsLinks to specs on Apple site prevented due to low rep. I totally left out the obvious camera and face time support in the next rev.http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTOE66M00620100723  suggests that iPad production will be held back due to screen availability. 
Either LG will step up and produce more screens, or Apple will may need to find a new screen source.@SpecKK I added some links for the iPhone and iPad, if I got the wrong ones please add a comment, or you should be able to add multiple links yourself now.Sounds like a reasonable strategy. Apple makes a new version of iPhone (and possibly iPad as well) once a year. Amazon follows more or less a similar timeline (often delayed). I bought a Kindle2 three months ago; now Kindle3 is going to be out in a month (no big differences though). I will likely wait for Kindle4.typing on iPad is beyond horrible though. It is a good passive browsing device, however.@an0 I've tried to clarify the question so it reads like I think you intended, please feel free to edit the question further if I've misunderstood your intent.IIRC, an iPhone HAS to be registered through iTunes...@ck01: Apple activated mine at the store right away, on their iTunes.Kristopher, thanks for your thorough reply. I think I might expect (for example) to use the inbuilt calendar app and synchronise that with Google Calendar. Are you saying that's not possible without sync via PC/Mac?If the iPad matches the iPhone software, then you should be able to sync mail, contacts and calendar with outside sources over the air (for instance, on my iPhone, I have my contacts and my calendar synced to my Google Account).I haven't tried syncing calendar or contacts with Google or with Exchange, so can't comment on whether it works or how well.Exchange Syncing works well. Better than OS X even. I dunno about Google syncing.  Google's calendar protocol has always sucked, and their Gmail/IMAP implementation is incredibly sketchy, but seems to work well enough.Ah, you're right! I would expect this to be available on the iPad as well, so there would really be no need for a computer, except for 3G activation.Google calendar has a full CalDAV server interface.  iOS is a fully capable CalDAV client... = peanut butter + chocolate...   http://blogs.sun.com/chienr/entry/configuring_caldav_on_iphone_3I get the impression Apple is allergic to the idea of an OEM.Thanks that worked, that's what I get for trying to work around iTunes...Does this also sync contacts and calendar?Yes. I do this with my iPhone - outlook contacts and calendar sync up to gmail and then down to the phone. I actually said messages, but I haven't done that myself, and I should note that I might be wrong on that - you might have to grab mail directly from wherever it comes from (the iOS mail clients can connect to pretty much any kind of mail server directly).Strange it says here that it's $2.99, guess I'll have to wait for my credit card to arrive+1 because it works, but I'll have to test how well it does multimediaPlanning to try this one @Nifle, but waiting for my credit card to arrive ;-)@Ivo - They have a link to a free version on their homepage. Don't know how it differs from the full version though.It only shows you three files in your folder, so you don't get access to all your contentThe UK and US have them tooJust what I needed!Does it have to be an App card or will any iTunes card work?  And where do you enter the card number?Any iTunes card will doWow, that's interesting. Before I posted my answer I found hints that the normal iTunes cards could not be used to buy apps. But the description of the cards indeed tell it clearly: both card types can be used for music, videos and apps.Yeah, I've accidentally double tapped and had it zoom and it did seem like magic to zoom just the text area. But again, sometimes website creators make the text too small. Seems to me making it bigger and re-wrapping it basic functionality!Ah... the included power adapter is a 10W USB power adapter (10W is more than most others).  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060The thing that confuses me though is why any PC that supports USB2.x standards cannot charge the iPad. Power specs for USB ports are universal and standards are set by IEEE.Standards Change and USB is positively ancient at this point they added a Battery Charging standard into USB - I don't know if the apple chargers meet the Battery Charging rules as they also specify reduced data rates - which might go someway to explaining the hideously slow sync times i see - or not. Apple started using higher power sockets  with the origina macbook Air's Superdrive which used a higher voltage USB socket.Ah... It seems is not possible u_uYour bold print is wrong. SHSH blobs only apply for reinstalling v4.0 up on a second gen iPod Touch.Hmmm...I couldn't find anywhere online stating that. Everywhere I read says that for all models, you must back up your SHSH blobs in order to downgrade. Why is the 2nd Gen iPod different? And can you point me to a source please?SHSH blobs were first introduced with the iPhone 3GS/Touch 3G. Older models don't have a hardware SHSH check. In iOS 4.0, Apple put in a software check for the Touch 2G and iPhone 3G, but this only affects installing the 4.0 firmware. http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/833937433/blob-banterGotcha. Thanks for the info! Very informative!How do you put your device into DFU?@Philippe: Link added.Thanks. I knew it was something obvious. I just didn't see that button. Thanks. BTW: Do you know a way to add the current song to a playlist while you are playing it?I'm not sure if there's a way to do that. . . which is actually why I love(d) my Zune so much (RIP) lolCan you please scale that screenshot down? It's hugeYou didn't have to remove it completely - all you had to do to scale it 50% was to do `<img src="http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/f363bc33a4.png" height="480">`lol yeah my bad. i took the long route. i just removed the huge one and scaled the image itself down. still don't get the hang of adding pics on here yetI recently figured out how to do this...it seems like there should be a less-complicated way.  Old iPods used to have On-The-Go, which could be created by long-pressing on songs.  Too bad that doesn't work anymore.(Retagged as per http://meta.gadgets.stackexchange.com/questions/29)The distance argument doesn't work because the app store problems started the day iOS4 was released, but I've been in Australia for the past 2 months.  But I guess I will have to contact them.  ThanksMostly good advice, except for the last point. Li-ion batteries don't tend to appreciate being completely drained too often, but it can be a good idea to do it occasionally (every few months or so) to recalibrate the battery meter. See [this answer](http://gadgets.stackexchange.com/questions/23/battery-conditioner/451#451) for more info.I bought a generic USB wall charger on eBay for use as a spare, it was $4 delivered and works perfectly with my iPhone.That's helped me with several "oddities" on my Touch (mainly related to volume).For some reason, even after holding the button down for 20 secs, the slide to power off slider wouldn't appear, so I killed it. That fixed it. ThanksI updated my question to address the line-out suggestionPardon me if this sounds silly, but have you tried restoring? If not, maybe that will fix the WiFi...hopefully lol.I tried a couple of times. No candy...@silvo I thought the phrase was "No dice", but I like your version better. :DWindows 95 on the iPhone, ace.That is awesome! Thanks a million :)hi user606, I removed the your greeting because the first line of the question is displayed in the summary on the home page. I've also rephrased it slightly to hopefully clarify the meaning.Let me guess. You have a dead battery on your iPod and want to de-brickify it without replacing the battery?@awakeFromNib I've tried to clarify the question to make it less generic. It would probably be helpful if you could update your question to explain *why* you want to do this. Is @JohnFx's guess right?+1 I do exactly this with an old iPod nano. Its battery life is measured in minutes, but its been sat happily in a dock pumping out noise for months without issue.Yea, I have an old 3rd iPod more or less permanently attached to my car fro the same reason.@HanuAthena I tried to change the title to better reflect the nature of the issue (I'm not sure I have though...). It is generally a good idea to be fairly specific with the title.Thanks. At that price I'll risk it ;pSpecifically, that's a mini-DIN connector.I'll give it a shot. I tried doing a restore but that put my touch in the same position it was in before the restore.I'll try this! Thanks for the suggestion.Wifi location works surprisingly well with the iPod touch, but I just want to find it in my house. Do you think is that impractical to have an app that connects somewhere to see if it needs to beep for some seconds? Maybe that's why I can't find it... But an app that turned the wifi on every 5 minutes just to check that status and then off again shouldn't be that inefficient. Maybe it could be considered a virus. Anyway, the devices are too bulky.I agree on the bulkiness of devices, but due to the impracticality of the other solutions, it is probably the best. You are certainly free to leave your WiFi on for as long or as little as you like. But currently the only way to make one of those apps function correctly would be to have WiFi always on. No system exists yet to have WiFi just beacon on and off every few minutes.How would the iPod receive those messages? Don't those apps use SMS to send information to the device?It's an instant message that looks like and pops up like a system message. I tested it with my iPod Touch 8GB 2nd Gen, and it works.That is pretty sweet! I wouldn't of expected them to accept the message over WiFi if it was an SMS message. But then again other jailbreak apps figured out SMS over WiFi too.we have done a few re-syncs and iTunes does say "Optimizing Photos".   It just seem to thing that saving space is worth more then having nice look photos you can zoom into.Strange - it 'optimizes' my photos but I am able to zoom into them a bit once they are synced back to my iPhone.  Perhaps there is some issue with how they have been optimized - I don't think you can customize that.Does that mean that I can download a podcast directly to the iPod, or do I have to sync it from iTunes on my computer?@Kyle Cronin: Aren't all iPod Touch models wifi-only?@jdl Yes, sorry. u07ch mentioned his iPhone and I forgot the question was about iPod Touches.Went to my local apple store on saturday; the iTunes application on them had the podcast section so if your podcast is in itunes you can download it without a computer.+1 for the idea. For whatever reason, the 3rd party apps that I found all required jail breaking. This particular app, however, has some bad reviews that are concerning. Anyone know of more solid and polished apps that perform this function?Yeah, that app is kinda marginal at best.I would love something like this for my laptop.In the RC electronics world these are a lifesaver for older or misused batteries.  I don't think i've heard of them for devices like phones, laptops or UPCs though.Good question, as I don't think enough people understand what conditioning is... :)This is using the built-in battery controller.  A conditioner can (potentially) go beyond the normal use limitations of this in terms of voltage and/or current in order to condition the battery.  I'm not sure if the asker was looking for an external conditioner or not.+1 for the Battery University reference and talking about all sides of the question.Thank you.  Do yo have happen to know if there is a way to change this on my iPod without iTunes?Probably not.  I suggest a resync with your PC/mac.The ipod touch won't let you shuffle an Audiobook/podcast/iTunes U file. 
Instead it gives you the option to listen to it at 2x, 1/2x or regular speed, and has a 30 seconds back button to quickly go back if your are interruptedThanks, but I'm looking for a way to not have to interact with the iPod directly or have to turn the car off & back on to get the device to sleep.There are a few different variants of the iPod connector - the cable that came with my iPhone (and caught fire - another story!) was much smaller than the one for my iPod, even though it's the same connector. Having said that, I have no idea how to pull them apart...As you don't specify what you want to do with it afterwards, a large hammer may do the trick.Do you actually need to take it apart? or do you need a disassembled connector for some modding?I **knew** I'd seen that setting before. Urgh. Here's hoping it comes back. (I left feedback as well, but my hopes aren't high.)Thanks, i'll try it, but I'm searching for something that does a system level(warning shameless plug) if you're looking for multi-room audio some of these options may help: http://home4film.com/questions/10/how-can-i-set-up-a-multi-room-stereo-system-for-less-than-a-grandWait, it opens *word*?

Yes.  Did anyone ever do it? No. Do most new phones not bother with the camera on the front now? Yes.  `</rant>`Ah.. that's great.should be noted that a Facetime call uses approx. 3MB/minute of 3G data.I'm not sure I understand your question. Can you add some more detail please? I can add and edit contacts just fine with my iPhone 4 as I did with my 3G.Perhaps it is because I restored a backup from my old 3GS to the new phone?  Either way, the + button in the Contacts app isn't there, and neither is the Edit button when I look at a contact...On a brand-new iPhone 4, the Contacts application is the only built-in application on the *second* app screen. Swipe to the right and you should see it.I can't do that; the + button is missing on mine!Are you syncing your contacts with any sources?  Please check Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars and see if any accounts say "Contacts" underneath.I've been hearing about this Microcell lately. What made you get one? Do you live in a bad service area? Or does it boost network performance in ANY area?They sell it for $150 at AT&T stores in the US, and rumor has it that they are giving them away to certain 'good' customers.

They give you a short-range cell in your house that backhauls via the internet. You plug it into an ethernet, and it sits there providing 5 bars within 40 feet.Very cool! I think I might look into it. Thanks!This has nothing to do with Wifi or edge, I think. The m-cell is just a cell; it's like having your own private cell tower.It sounds like it's directly related to me. Network Settings controls all of the device's communications (maybe with the exception of bluetooth). I think resetting will fix the issue.

Have you tried running the gadget down then timing a full charge on both? I suspect it may be a case of watched pots...There's plenty of power available from a car to power a phone or iPod charger.@Dennis Williamson: plenty of power to charge it at a decent pace, but not plenty of power to charge it MUCH faster than at home.A typical gadget draws 300-500 milliamps while charging. A typical cigarette lighter socket is fused for 20 amps. You can run a 150W (120V AC output, about 15A DC input) inverter from a cigarette lighter socket. Believe me, there's *plenty* of headroom for a quick charger. I have an AC powered quick charger that will charge 4 AA batteries in an hour. It only pulls 18W (120V AC)...Just because you have 1800 W available in a home AC outlet, that doesn't mean you can jam that down a cellphone's throat. The biggest DC adapter I have is 2250mA and it only draws half an amp on the AC side. A DC-DC adapter that's 12V in and 5V-500mA out is only going to draw about 200mA plus whatever's lost to inefficiency.Great answer. Thanks!So I haven't actually owned an iphone in about 6months but a friend recently got one and had this problem, and I remember being confused about it when I owned one.

I assume this is a lossy conversion?If they buy it contract-free unlocked factory (directly from Apple), then yes. Individual vendors (Vodafone, Orange, etc.) will sell you the phone at a lower price, but you will have to sign a contract for 2 years and pay them the corresponding data and voice fees.I see. But based on reports on the web, it seems to be possible to get an iPhone unlocked after you outrun your contract. I thought if you buy the phone full price it would be the same.yeah, i've wrestled with having it not ask me.  I guess I'll try it for a while and see how it goes.Of course, an iPhone bought from the UK may be really *expensive* compared to the US (esp. now with relatively weak dollar), but if you really need it unlocked, that is one option. :)Another caveat: warranty & service may obviously be problematic if you buy the phone from abroad. (For us it's tolerable; you get some extra hassle, but due to EU laws Apple has to provide service even if you bought it e.g. from UK.)Where is the "Share" button?@Bravax: Sorry.

I don't know.It's a great IDE, and it's FREE.Given that Jailbreaking for the purpose of running additional software has been explicitly authorized as a legal exception to DMCA restrictions by the Library of Congress, and given that we've had several other Jailbreak questions, I don't see why not.The Canadian Apple Store sells unlocked iPhones too.Kyle, you rule. Thanks!Looks like my only option, so far... I'll try that.Why isn't the script run in the path it resides when I double click? Is there a way to refer to paths relative to the script?In other words: when you press the add button while viewing the list of accounts (like in that image), or while in the **All Notes** list, it will create a note in the default account.Great! 8GB, here I come...@Senseful: Correct!On iOS devices that have hardware encryption (iPhone 3GS and up, 3rd generation iPod Touch and up, iPad), wiping the phone is nearly instantaneous, since it only has to overwrite the encryption key for your data to be inaccessible.Does it show as a popup message on your iPod? Sometimes in my iPhone or iPad I will attempt to download an application, which proceeds to place an icon on the home screen with a little progress bar before popping up a message saying that the application could not be installed. Attempting to install again usually works fine, but sometimes have to try two more times before it would work.Unfortunately, the widget then appears above all Windows, which makes this not very usefulThanks, I'm not seeing that on my iPad for some reason.@Victor: you got itLOL I actually read some of your macrumors post when I was caddy and SSD shopping :P  I remember because I thought, "This guy put a lot of work into this post, I feel bad that no one has posted any feedback...."  and then I went on to the next link in my google results hahahaha :)  (to be fair though, I had no macrumors forum account at the time :P )not sure if this is better as a comment or an answer, but perhaps you're also interested in taking a peek at [Gentoo Prefix](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/). i myself dropped macports for GP and am having plenty fun with it, but i do come from several years of running gentoo linux, which makes it much easier to troubleshoot occasional systemic quirks. note: handling launchdaemons is a big problem in GP as well.Yep, I know. It works and boots and whatnot, problem is: it boots just a little slower and iStatPro can't read the temperatur information from the HDD.There is a Stack Exchange proposal for Jail broken phones http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/18154/jailbreak-iphone-development?referrer=EuWVi6IpN0_KzzEhC7I-Qw2@ghoppe: Right, that's probably the best choice for OP then, provided  there's some Borderlinx-like service (or Canadian friend/relative) availableAs an aside, bettertouchtool now has the same functionality, so if you're using both you can save a little bit of resources.@SCdF - I think it has always been like this but I'm not sure either. My first iPhone was 3GS with iPhone OS 3.You're in luck, because most stuff on your list are non-issues on the Mac side. :) Specifically about disk defragmenting, see [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/829/do-macs-need-to-be-defragmented).See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/639/why-is-my-macbook-pro-getting-so-slow/Nice one! Really saves precious seconds.@lkraav: yeah gentoo is awesome, but gentoo prefix duplicates worse than macports, installing his own gcc, libraries and all. So every command is slower because it needs to load all the libraries from the prefix, instead of using the system ones that are already loaded in RAM most of the times. And AFAIK (I used it < 2 years ago) it's not well mantained.I used to use that, until I lost the one that came with my iMac. The others aren't nearly as good.Chocolate covered iPad? Sounds delicious! Mmmm...`google.com` -> `define: oleophobic` -> `surfaces, by contrast, repel oils.

I'm not, I'm just a user that wants to use Jailbreak apps on his phone.It seems like such a simple feature that has been extremely feasible for at least ten years now at least.  I'm surprised that even today it requires jailbreak to get it working on the latest and greatest phone.It shows a pop-up on the iPod with the message in my question. It has "Retry" and "Quit" buttons. Retrying does  no good.I am pretty sure it is a networking thing. The apps install just fine if I connect the iPod to the computer and use i-Tunes, or if I use my home wifi to download/install them. It just does this on my work wifi connection and some other public wifi hotspots. Also, at these locations it consistently happens for all apps, not just a specific one.Okay, thanks for the update and the edit to the question. I'll have a think and get back to you... pretty sure I've had this working regardless of whether the macbook is on an AD network or not. I do tend to use the VMs bridged all the time, not NAT, but even so...@Bravax: Do you have iBooks installed?@Moshe - You clearly need more absorbant and geek-friendly shirts.Great! Works! Is there a parameter I can give to the 'eject' command so it auto-force-disconnects the drives? It asked unjustly for a force disconnect when I ran it.Thanks for the pointer. Exactly the info I needed.I did this a while back, and while I think it had *some* effect, the improvement was not huge. Even with version 4.1, [which was supposed to fix this](http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/971051), at least my iPhone 3G is still way more sluggish in most things compared to pre-4.0 versions.The link you gave (to Apple Human Interface Guidelines) is useful. Lots of interesting details to be learned from there (this was new to me: a dot in the (red) close button means there are unsaved changes).PhotoRec would work great for this IF IT SUPPORTED DMG FILES :)  Just a rant... I've used PhotoRec (free!) a few times and it always gets my file back in no time, but last night i deleted a .dmg and it has no option to search for .dmg's :/Are you asking a general question about all MBP's or only about the new models of them?you can't upgrade your CPU without some serious skillz... it's also soldered onto the logic board.Assuming you are using a bash script, this question over at stackoverflow will help you out :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-inhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks/1573#1573@Nippysaurus Thank you, but this question is about 3 weeks older than the answer you point to.Upgrading the CPU is about just as hard as upgrading the graphics card. Which means, not possible.I have the identical issue, but with a Pioneer DEH-P6900UB unit and my 4th gen iPod. For me, though, I've found that the deck is somehow setting the alarm on, so that every 24 hours it turns on and then plays music until the battery is dead. Turning the alarm off manually when the car is stopped works, but like you, I find it a pain to have to open the glovebox to do this every time.Duplicate of [Possible to merge or consolidate two iTunes Store accounts from the same household, to share apps and other purchases?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1460/possible-to-merge-or-consolidate-two-itunes-store-accounts-from-the-same-househol)I'm running the beta of 4.2 on my iPad, and the Unified Inbox feature is definitely there. So awesome.This works for the screen brightness as well: Option + Shift + Brightness Up/DownI cannot downvote, however: the result of doing this is that iTunes still starts, still does some kind of mini-sync, but doesn't recognise the name of the phone or allow access to its contents. On ejecting and disconnecting, the music library needs to rebuild itself on the phone. I confirmed I had used the setting, quit iTunes and tried again, with exactly the same result (albeit, could access contents this time).Furthermore, even if this worked, it would prevent the machine being used at all for syncing, no? If you want to have iPhone A synced with computer A and iPhone B with computer B, you would not be able to use A with B for charging/playing music/grabbing photos etc.+1 that's interesting.I can't install mc without root access, so I could only try muCommander. Directory listings are blazing fast indeed, but filetransfers are really slow now (136k/s vs 1Mb/s in finder....).What kind of connections did you have before you disconnected?@balexandre Just as the iPod touch 4G, the iPhone 3GS also doesn't have the Apple HDR feature (as you can obviously see on your own screenshot). So this was supposed to be a helpful answer so that you can also take HDR pictures with your iPod touch....and muCommander can only copy files, not open them for editing. Bummer.So what's the solution if I installed Boot Camp 3.1 and Windows 7?+1 - I use a mouse, but this is still my most used shortcut.probably the only decent answer here.  Apple is fantastic, but stupid stuff like this sure is disappointing.Just out of curiosity: why do you need installers for both 10.6 and 10.6.3?See [What are some good non-Apple mice for Mac OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2257/what-are-some-good-non-apple-mice-for-mac-os-x), which overlaps with this question.That did the trick, thanks.He can change the partition names just fine; what he can't change is the name of the disk images. Those have to be named "Mac OS X Install DVD," so the question becomes: how can he tell which one to boot from?But doesn't the boot menu show whatever the volume name is rather than what image was restored to the volume?Does that void the warranty?this doesn't make any sense to me... the 'image" he's talking about is just the image that he cloned to the partitions.  So the partition/volumes end up with the same name as the volume/image he cloned from.  But there should be nothing preventing him from renaming the volume which changes the partition label and makes it display differently in the boot menu.aaaaaahhh I see... What you're trying to say is that the installer partition/image/volume needs to be named Mac OS X Install DVD.  However, this is incorrect... OS X will install just fine no matter what you name the installer DVD/image/volume/partition or whatever.  I've named mine anything from "hack" to "Installer" to "10.6.3 Installer".  It doesn't matter.Not if you don't break anything, are careful not to strip screws or remove stickers, and put the optical drive back in before you take it back in for service :)  Who really knows what actually voids an Apple warranty?  They seem to evaluate it on a case by case basis (or based on what "genius" happens to be working that day).  I say don't worry about it, be careful, and do what you want with the product you paid upwards of one thousand dollars for.  If you bark loud enough later and haven't filled the case with vaseline, they'll honor your warranty.Are you using something other than GUID partitioning?  I can't think of any other reason why changing the disk label would not change the menu display...This question was asked (in a Snow Leopard context) on super user: http://superuser.com/questions/31925 .  Unfortunately, the problem seems to be quite difficult to solve cleanly...@Anton: I'm not sure - there doesn't appear to be anything in Finder's AppleScript Dictionary about this and I've never had to force eject them. Sorry.Ok thanks, I know which is which now, I was just wondering if there was a way to change the names, in case someone else needed to use the hard drive.I will be using the hard drive to install Max OS X on many different machines (about 300) so I would prefer not to use any extra software.@Dori Because I may need to install on the newest Mac Mini and the model before, and the previous model doesn't boot from the 10.6.3 Install DVD.@calavera Nope, definitely using GUID partitioning.I have renamed the volumes/partitions, but on the boot menu they both show up as "Mac OS X Install DVD".can you post a screenshot of the volume info in disk utility and also he get info window in finder?do you have any Adobe apps on either machine? That's what I think someone would be most likely to run into trouble, given the number of product registration issues they've caused.Yes, PS on my wife's.  No issues... it was originally installed on her old mbp too.can I suggest you to use ?-click to open tabs in Safari?In the UK, you can definitely use standard iTunes gift cards (that you can get from department stores, garages, supermarkets etc) to put into an iTunes account and then use that credit to buy apps. I've bought the cards as gifts for people for that very reason.I can't install homebrew without root: user@mac is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
Failed during: /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir /usr/localAnd compiling it myself also requires a lot of sudo - which I can't do. Hell, there is no gcc and cc on this mac.Without gcc you will be unable to install it, with or without homebrew. Btw homebrew can be installed anywhere, see the [official documentation](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/installation).+1. I was skeptical about the Magic Mouse until I'd been using it for a few days. I absolutely love it.Thanks for your suggestion! Hear, just like Audio Hijack, has way to many features. My sole objective is listening to videos on some news sites. Its price seems adequate to the amount of things you can do with the software, but is indeed expensive for my particular purposes. This is why I'm not accepting the answer.After some experiencing, I'm accepting your answer. Until some simple software is available for boosting sound output on the mac, your suggestion, despite not very convenient, is a viable alternative to the expensive software out there. Thanks! :)I used Quicksilver for a long time, but I think Launchbar has the edge at this point.If it's the cord, [this](http://www.instructables.com/id/MacBook-Mag-Safe-Charger-Budget-Repair-Disas/) might be of help. Proceed with your own risk :)Comment about the BIG thing: I wonder why I didn't see any groundbreaking difference after 4.1 upgrade (my 3G was a lot faster with pre 4.0 versions).dude I know My sentences was so obvious, but if my charger was damaged then why when plug it in the monitor light turn on?+1 InsomniaX is a great app for this usage.Hmm, if the laptop receives power, but doesn't charge the batteries, my best guess is that the charger is only *partially* damaged. :-) By the way: [something possibly related](http://superuser.com/questions/111705/why-does-my-magsafe-power-connector-only-work-one-way-round) (does it work if you insert the adapter the other way round?).(Answers are not likely to be *MacBook Pro specific*, so I'd like to also tag this with `macbook`, or something like `laptop`.)Time Machine depends on UUID. A solution to this problem is given here: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090213071015789No, you'd still need to have a credit card in your PayPal account to be able to use it for iTunes. It doesn't matter if you have another source of funds (bank account, PayPal balance, etc.), if the PayPal account doesn't have a credit card, iTunes will not let you use it.Careful with putting photos in CV's -- in some countries/cultures it's considered nearly a requirement, while in others (I hear USA) a photo will put you straight in the wastebasket.no it's not work for me :(I use Xmarks and Chrome too. You can have Xmarks sync Chrome with Safari, then when you plug in your iPhone, iTunes will sync Safari to Mobile Safari. I don't plug my phone in much, so I use the Xmarks iPhone app, which doesn't integrate with Mobile Safari, but it does give you access to all your bookmarks on the Xmarks server.Why community wiki?The solution with the cmd script works best.I never had problems even with time machine.  I swapped out drives and when I hooked it up it picked up right where it left off.  Maybe this is only an issue in Leopard?Does this happen when creating an event using the web interface as well as the devices?also, what process did you use to create the bootable partitions? i.e. did you use CCC, disk utility, command line, etc?Great, that's just what I needed. Is there anywhere which documents these extra features?The reviews on the apple site seem to mirror my experience: http://store.apple.com/au/reviews/MC500X/A+1 for BetterTouchTool; I personally use that.For future reference, if you are going to buy headsets for gaming/music/skype, next time buy USB ones directly. Much better quality (digital).Same here, except I create a folder called "Binary/Software/" under my home directory.  I just don't like the clutter that arises in the Applications stack when I put extra stuff in it.++ InsomiaX works greatpardon my ignorance, but does this mean that the MacBook Pro's female audio in jack does not accept microphone input??@calavera That's what it means. It accepts an "audio line in" connection, which is a digital signal. Microphone input is analog (and weak).+agreed... should be no problems whatsoever as long as the memory isn't radically different from what your machine can handle@zneak wow that really blows... so if I wanted to hook up an external mic for recording an interview, it wouldn't work?awesome... this has been driving me crazy for a long time.  thanks.@calavera No (unless it has a line out instead of a microphone out), but the integrated microphone does a fairly good job. If there isn't too much noise (like music or angry fans running at full power), it should be pretty good.@zneak well luckily I have a zoom recorder as well. I was just under the impression that I had the option of hooking my handheld mic into that jack using a 1/4" to 3.5mm adapter, but I guess that's out of the question.  So how would one hook in a guitar for garageband?  Do you have to get an adapter that converts from 1/4" to digital line out?I used Disk Utility to create an image of the Install DVD, scan the image for restore, and then restored it onto a partition of the External HDD.
I have added the pictures that you requested.I use this pretty much constantly for archiving my CD collection to lossless FLAC and then later into mp3.  It's better than EAC (Windows only) in my opinion.  Easier to set up, faster, and far less buggy.@calavera Most real instruments have a line out and not a microphone out, so hooking a guitar shouldn't be a problem. As far as I know, only low-end microphones have a microphone out.ohh, but it's so dang fast with 4.1, Navigon takes less than one minute to load and get a signal... while with 4.0.2 It would take sometimes, and I'm not kidding, 4 to 5 minutes, it was terrible! (iPhone4 takes around 15 sec, now) :)dockstar is exactly what you want, why searching for more?@zneak I guess I need to look more into the difference between line-out and microphone-out.  I never knew there was a difference till now.To be clear: the preference you describe still exists, but it doesn't prevent iTunes from opening. Also, I know the difference between the two PCs. The PC that the phone is NOT synced to also opens iTunes/mini-syncs, even with the preference checked. With the preference checked, it seemed to cause actual damage to the phone (corrupt name, library) which had not occurred before.I still don't see how this would work with a second phone I wanted to sync with the second PC - if the preference worked as described, iTunes would not open...? Hence no sync? I'm aware of how downvoting works.Someone please add the `scp` tag.However be aware that some functions e.g. services are only available and can only make use of apps in /Application, ~/Applications and subdirectoriesThen the behavior of iTunes must have changed. All I ever did was disable automatic syncing in iTunes under the old Syncing preference pane and that prevented iTunes from ever opening automatically; there was never any other place to set this behavior, as far as I remember. At the same time, I've never once had problems with syncing any device except when syncing to a new machine, and even then, I got a warning window that allowed me to cancel before syncing.Ok, I didn't notice that there were information in the "top chapters" of that tree. Thanks !@balexandre Just to know whether there are other alternatives, which *might* be better.I think you're right, and I think it happens with both USB and Firewire type drives. I have an external RAID 1 FW800 setup and every time the drive goes to sleep and the finder kicks in (or an app brings up a file dialog), I get a 15-20 second pause while the 2 external drives spin back up.Putting only one shortcut (or a couple of related ones) in each answer will make the poll more useful.Thanks for Shift-Ctrl-Eject, I was looking for something like that.I believe Dockstar is possibly the best option.not quite what I'm looking for. I'm aware that applications cannot ever cover the dock, but my work computer allows me to resize an application behind the dock while my home computer does not.  I'm interested in knowing what controls this behavior.It would, indeed, and apparently all it takes is a TRRS male connector, two TRS female connectors, and some soldering skills.The Unarchiver provides the tool `unar`, that you have to download separately and install yourself.c) Yes, but font editing software is expensive, and fonts are a particularly fragile file format.+1... this is how I always test a drive that I'm swapping in.Yep - appears to work well on sit files, and has been recently updated (July 2010).Exactly, what @phillip said. You can play around with a font, but you might end up causing more trouble than anything else.Gotta try this.Never thought you could! You get my vote.nice one!  never thought of thatOK, thanks. If I'm ever feeling a little foolhardy I might give it a go and report back.Yup, it was (a) that seemed like the stumbling block to me too. Thanks for the info though.Mine tells only "MacBook Pro" :-( (it's 13")what is admin password? I only have password to my account.Nice! It worked with my own password, although I had to use `>console` without space after greater-than symbol.As @Peter said I edit @mipadi answer and omit space, if you think the space still required tell to put it again.@peter As I test it in my macbook pro 13" it tells just MacBook Pro too,so I choose pic from google.that is correct. On my home machine I cannot do that, on my work machine I can. It drives me mad to no end that it is allowed at work... maybe I'm a little OCD about my window sizes or something but I just don't like the window going beneath the dock :p+1, interesting. Additional limitations: Only works when no user is already logged in. And you obviously need to have "Name and password" (instead of "List of users") selected in Accounts -> Login Options.Finally I buy a new Magsafe Adapter :(I turn off MplayerX auto encoding recognition and test as many as encoding that I think was related but still can't see them correct.With "overly widescreen", do you mean you are accustomed to 16:10 so 16:9 seems a bit extreme? (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16:10)Are you sure that the content is correctly encoded? Try to open the subtitle file with TextWrangler, it should display the charset in the status bar. At this point you can even save in UTF-8 and whatnot.I was posting exactly this monitor. The great thing is that it's actually an [IPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFT_LCD#In-plane_switching_.28IPS.29) panel, which can display 16.7 million colors, instead of only 65,536 like the way more common and cheap TN panels (like the ones in laptops) that fake the other colors by using [dithering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithering) (hence the crappy color banding). It's also 16:10.Yeah, a 15" MBP has 1645 holes in each speaker grille, a 17" has more. Or did by "holes" did you mean the ports on the sides? Counting those might be a bit easier.Exactly what I was looking for. ThanksYes, I use the default basic dock on both computers. My home computers have always behaved this way (dual 500 MHz G4 and PowerBook G4 667 MHz from OS X public beta to 10.4ish, dual 2.5 GHz G5 from 10.4ish to 10.5, and my new tower in 10.6)... it's just the iMac at work that lets me resize behind the dock.updated question with link to video.Wait, i think I found something: Do you have an external display on the machine that allows you to resize?Glad it worked for you. YWI would like an internal 1 tb hard drive because I triple boot my laptop and I want to give my other OSs more spacethis is the western digital hard drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136545I thought this worked but it didn't. I renamed the second iDevice, syncing both of them and set up apps the way I wanted. Then I installed a new app on the second iDevice and the next time I sync'ed the first it had the new app installed on it.@Dan Ray - Yes, clearly.Got some nice feedback from people on this wallpaper. It looks absolutely filthy!I have an external display on both machines... though you may be on to something, as I believe the "primary" display may be the one without the dock on my home computer, where the imac's display has the dock on the work computer.Thanks, I think all that detail would've been received better if I took pictures and put it on a personal blog.  The mission of MacRumors isn't necc. fixit help.  I also find posting what you discover is helpful to solidify your own understanding, so the reward is in the doing... btw, which caddy did you go with?Actually the videos are originally AVI/h.264 which I iSquinted to mp4 anyway, but I don't think iMovie supports AVI...Yes I see the disk. The seek time of a of a 7200 RPM disk is faster and there will be slight differences, however there are a few small disadvantages of using a 7200 RPM disk: it uses more power, usually makes more noise and it generates more heat. If you value space, then go ahead and purchase the biggest drive you can afford :) There are 7200 RPM 1B drives too if that worries you.It seems to be a really nice screen with loads of inputs and the fact that you can rotate it is great. A bit expensive unfortunatly.Display quality isn't such a problem for me. I do have a 16:10 screen now and not 16:9. Those that I've seen in person are mostly HP screen, they seem overly wide because of their very low height.A 3G? I'm curious how much. The 3G *S* is $99 *new*.ahhhh success!

(I'd forgotten I have a check card on my Paypal.)  Apple refused to accept my credit card for iTunes, so I had to use Paypal.  I guess Paypal is my money laundering service!well they added smart playlists, but this app is such a steaming pile of crap that it's not worth going through the trouble.

I'm not at all sure on the costings - I'm sure someone could work it out - but I wouldn't be hugely surprised if a retina screen were much more expensive, possibly even prohibiting it from the next release.@Jeff: was that your initial reaction, or after a significant time of usage? I thought pretty much the same at first, but even after just a few days, typing is getting a lot easier. Just learning to *trust* the keyboard was part of the problem.Well, he did say 5,3 in his MBP model, which I believe is unibody.Please don't just simply link to another answer.

Simply answering the question makes it easier on the OP. I'm not saying that linking is bad, but just that simply posting a link isn't what is considered a sufficient answer in SE. From the same thread: "One problem with links is that they can die/expire, the pages on the target site get reorganised or deleted, and the link is no longer valid." and "posting only a link as an answer requires the person reading the answer to perform an additional action (click on the link) in order to see your answer"Perhaps, but it works and the answer is within the constraints of the OP's question: "Is there a way to start/stop internet sharing from the command line or maybe an *apple script*?" Downvoting really ought to be saved for the really egregious answers. ThanksHence no "official" downvote. :)."works and is within constraints" makes me think we should have a new site: http://rubegoldberg.stackexchange.comAir Display doesn't lag bad, but it uses compression so you get pixelation for a second on motion, but it clears quickly.  I use it with my Mac but I see the Windows version is released now too.  Will download it when I get home.Isn't that what http://thedailywtf.com/ is for? ;-)Camstasia can record any portion of the screen, as far as I can remember.You should add some description of what Hub List does.Seems interesting (if a bit pricey). Consider adding to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1286/great-ipad-apps too.Doesn't that only apply if you also have an external display connected?It can, but unfortunately you can't specify the area of the screen when keynote is running. So I will probably make a wallpaper of just the 1024x768 in the middle of the screen so I can specify the area.  Although having it just grab the area would be idea.I have SwitchResX and didn't see that option.  Too bad they removed it.  Guess I am stuck.  I'll look at SwitchResX again though.  Thanks!if this is really a big issue for you i'd be willing to start a bounty on your behalf.  i'm pretty much at the end of my ideas on why this might be happening.I ended up getting the Magic Mouse, thank you!Sorry if I was unclear above, but the problem is that I do not get that far. After the progress bar screen (after language selection before the screen you are talking about) the screen goes grey then the computer completely cuts off.I'm hoping to get some kind of detailed screen of what's going on or some sort of log so I know why it keeps cutting off.Its a MacBook pro. I don't know how to tell what version it isHe said in the question that it's currently running 10.3.You can find [the tech specs here](http://support.apple.com/specs/#macbookpro). But all that really matters is: what video out port does your MBP have?once again nice catch.  I scanned through it a couple times but I guess my ADD kept skipping the parentheses :)True enough!  I got the cheapo ebay caddy(http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&Item=280506718072&Category=74949&_trkparms=algo%3DLVI%26its%3DI%26otn%3D1).  It works great... I posted some stuff about it in the "MCE Optibay Alternative Cheap" thread.  My username is losmuertos.ok there is one issue that pops up in this configuration.  If you have a mobileme account and sometimes use a computer that has the /Users folder in the original position (i.e. the boot volume), your dock will get all screwed up.  Any stacks or folders you have in your dock that point to folders on the Users volume will disappear or lose their settings after you logon to the machine with the original config.  Other weirdness like idisk sync issues and missing dock app icons may ensue.  However, I solved the problem by just switching all my mobileme synced machines to the same partition scheme.Do you mean a second monitor in addition to it's own screen, or in addition to an external monitor you already have hooked up?Thanks for your explanation and pointers to the articles. Very interesting stuff.(no idea what 5.3 represents, sorry) but it is still 9,5mm :)Will the AddressBook application also work in Windows?It's a brand new MacBook Pro so there isn't a previous owner. However, the document can be viewed within TextEdit for some reason.The Address Book application is Mac OS X specific. On Windows use either Outlook or the Windows Address Book depending on your setup and what you have chosen to sync your contacts with (check iTunes as it should say).Yeah I hope you don't play games (forgot to mention that). Let us know how it goes :-)Updated question with script method!Awesome! It works, thanks!Thanks, this seems to work for simple cases. But I've got a very large document (over 1000 pages) and it almost crashes the system just by trying to select-all!Thanks for the pointers, but which of these would actually contain `ps2ascii`? And which one should I prefer?I don't know if I'm pushing it too much but could you give me details on exactly what do I have to install and how? (Full disclaimer: I'm a fairly experienced user and I've already managed to install it, but on the beta stage of this site I would like to see how much detail and information are we to expect from people giving answers.)I think a question like that would step out of the scope of SE since there are already very detailed docs available on their site. A more suitable question in this case, as far as I see it, would be to post a question related to installation after you've tried to install it, installation fails after repeated attempts, and searching the web yields little or no answers.MacPorts handles Ghostscript 9 (the latest version).An offbeat solution related to the above answer is that Acrobat *7* actually made surprisingly clean text extractions (but you are better off using a proper utility like ghostscript for something that large).where were you when I asked my question about syncing itunes libraries (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1045/how-can-i-sync-my-itunes-music-library-between-two-computers-for-free)?  that link is great :PFYI it was with the iPhone 3G.Recommend to **not** read Prince McLean/Daniel Eran Dilger's series. There are factual errors everywhere. Otherwise answer is great.It shipped 8 months before my dad started running into usability issues. I've been putting him off on this, hoping a solution would arise.  I'm surprised at the lower ebay price. Not sure why Google shopping didn't bring that up any time I've looked before.I had to upgrade RAM as well before we considered bumping the OS.OS X native utility is the Adobe Reader application, which has Save as Text.hehe, right ... but that isn't an option in OP's list :-) (I've updated the answer though)+1, I would've answered the same thing if you hadn't done it first :)@Sietse: I want a second monitor in addition to its own screenI say "OSX" Oh-Es-Ex most of the time.It does not ship unlocked. I have to request the unlock to the carrier. I want to confirm that they succeeded at it.I'm not sure if the file name "3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28" is iPhone version dependent. On my Mac, I just can't find this file.+1 I really enjoy of this+++++ can't believe I didn't know about say before... I've been having far too much fun with it now that I saw this post :)Are you on Windows or OS X? My system is OS X 10.4.6 and iPhone 3GS running 4.0.1.Ah hah, maybe that is it-- it only syncs the recently played! That would explain my experience if so. Thanks.Forgive my non-native ignorance, but what's the difference between "OS Ex" and "Oh-Ess Ex"? Do you pronounce "OS Ex" like "Ossex"? :)Yeh, that is it. I just retried searching with spotlight and saw that it was actually finding it - it was just down the bottom!next time, make sure to add, at least the `Windows` talk so we know that you talk from a Windows perspective, as this is Apple forum, I always assume, if not mention otherwise that it's a Mac you have.That's not going to work with the `fn` key.nop, but you can assign other that does everythingOS X 10.6.4, iPhone 3GS 4.0; I also tried to spotlight this file but not found.It's elegant and gorgeous, but I notice it gets confused sometimes. It could well be that it's Google Reader being confused behind the scenes (that sometimes happens in the browser too!), but I wish Reeder degraded better when that happens.Ow, that could be the way to do it. I'll try it and keep you informed :-)you may be able to get around this by adjusting the smart playlist of recently played (tell it to show more than a month for example).Well you can find it a couple of ways... Go to that folder and then find all the SQLite DB's and search each one (**file * | grep SQLite**). There are quite a few, so you could try syncing, send an SMS, and re-sync. Look at timestamps, only a few files should have changed.@deceze: I was following the OP's lead with that, I say "O" then "S" then "X".@deceze : I'll update my post to see if I can make it more clear. It's hard to pronounce things in ascii. "In cyberspace, nobody can hear you scream."+1, That's cute. But is that authoritative? How do I know that `say` is pronouncing this the right way? Should I trust that the Mac engineers modified the letters "OS X" to be said the "Apple Way"?+1 for the authoritative source. Thank you. `say Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard` thanks you.@Stefan In a word, yes. This is precisely the sort of detail Apple sweats over. The Wrath of Steve would be swift and merciless had they got it "wrong". It had to have been changed, since "X" would never be pronounced "ten" in any other context.What does Steve say about the pronunciation of `say Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard`, I wonder.Historically, that method caused the artwork to be stored per-file, wasting lots of space. I think that's still true, but I haven't checked. Also, I've tried several non-iTunes methods of finding artwork and found that the quality in general is noticably worse. They do a very good job when the get it right.... just want to improve the system.I'm always puzzled by your second question.  You have subverted the OS on your iPhone in some way, and have messed with its internals in a way Apple can't really predict.  Now, why would you accept a software update?  If I were to muck with the kernel and related software on one of my Linux boxes, which we can all agree I have a perfect right to do, would it be intelligent to just accept the next thing the update manager wanted to give me?Thanks a lot for the trick!Wow, seriously, "Mac Ohs Ex"? It would never have occurred to me to pronounce it that way. :)That action pack allows you to type a keystroke, not use a keystroke to activate an automator action"Oh eh sex"? Or "Oh eh sucks" if you're a New Zealander?Try here: http://www.powerbookmedic.com/identify-mac-serial.php+1 I really enjoy of learning 'pmset'you just need to add to finder or if suggest you equivalent to finder it's ok too?A little bit of Spotlight cleverness allows you learn where an  item is by Cmd-clicking or Cmd-<return>ing its entry in the Spotlight list.  Instead of launching the item, it will open a finder window to the item's parent folder with the item highlighted.  Besides showing you where that item resides, it lets you do lots of things to it - delete it, move it, or open it with a non-default application.  My favorite, for a PDF or a spreadsheet, is to just touch <space> to open it with QuickView.Okay, its a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008) so I should use the mini-display portThe Darwin kernel was based on the Mach Microkernel from CMU. The BSD kernel was monolithic, like the Linux kernel is. The Unix system living on top of the kernel was derived from BSD. Apple people always seem to get this wrong for some reason.This sounds like a clever solution (so long as it's not too powerful a magnet, or so close to the phone as to mess with data).  I couldn't get the recalibration screen to come up, though.  I even tried moving two magnets around the phone independently.  No dice.It actually uses Gracenote (formerly CDDB) for the data about CDs - then the iTunes store for artwork.To my delight I just noticed that cmd + click (or cmd + enter) in Spotlight search results (and some other places) follows the same logic (= show in Finder instead of opening)Note that the shortcut for launching Spotlight is configurable in System Prefs. To my understanding the default is **Cmd + space**, not opt + space.It's not too much of a big issue, I know which install is which now, I was just wondering if there was an easy way to change them. Thanks for the offer though.Thank you for your detailed answer. I checked my MAC Mini model and it is MacMini 2,1. In my Mac Mini Memory information, it says my RAM is 512 MB, DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz. I found this 8GB RAM: http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-CT2KIT51264BC1067-204-PIN-PC3-8500-SODIMM/dp/B001MX5YWI/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1285531955&sr=1-6 Do you have any idea if this would work? Another one is: http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=ddr2+667MhZ+8GB&cid=15091922809039655711# But I still don't get why the 8GB model is more than double the price of a 4GB model...Thanks for your time. I'm currently in the process of picking the right ram module. I replied to balexandre's post with another question. Would you have an answer for that by any chance?Is there something I've done wrong?Neither Ukelele nor KeyRemap4Macbook seem able to do this, but they are both great programs for the other tasks involved in having weird keyboards.Someone who "hates" "the look & feeling of TextWrangler" isn't going to like BBEdit either.This basically works like the command line `cd` command. Type `/...` to go to absolute paths, `~/...` for paths relative to the user directory and `...` for directories relative to the current directory. Great for opening hidden directories.@r00fus `Space` has always been the Quick Look launcher, even on 10.5.@David, of course, there is always non-zero risk. The question is how big, which depends on (1) whether jailbreak changes rarely- or frequently-updated part of the system, (2) whether it changes anything that's required to boot and restore the system. For example, if all Apple's firmware updater does is overwrite the main flash partition *and* jailbreak only touches the main partition, there is virtually no risk. On the other hand if Apple's updater depends on some bootloader specifics that jailbreak subtly changes, then I might be in trouble. Therefore I'm curious how exactly does it work.For the Automator method, I just had to ensure I had the input passed as argumentsya that screwed me up for a minute as well.. I was coming back to edit with that caveat ;PActually, that only works if I select a single word, not a couple of wordsDid you check MacSales page for upgrade your mini at: http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/mac-mini/ ? 2x2Gb = $89.99, witch is the max you can put in your model.For scanners there is a third party app that works with almost all scanners: this is VueScan, see http://www.hamrick.com/I provided more information in the question.Thanks for the workaround to use IMAP instead. It's only a workaround though, as using Exchange/Google Apps nicely syncs my contacts as well, which is important to me. I could probably use Exchange only for contacts and turn off email in that, and then set up IMAP email at the same time.You might want to have a look at my answer on how to sync a device with 2 machines. While it won't prevent the mini-syncing you mention, it at least ensures that you won't have your Library cleared upon syncing: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2528/sync-itunes-u-on-2-macs-with-an-ipod/2608#2608not an official one, but equally as good, as well as an explanation on which to use depending on your intended usage and video source: http://lifehacker.com/5572037/handbrake-presets-for-your-new-ipad-or-iphone-4Same goes for the audio symbol and the bluetooth symbol.Thanks! This is by far the most simple solution, it was able to cope with my huge file without any problems and produced a reasonably clean and usable text output.good, thanks for the pointers!+1 for "they just make you feel better." TRUE! I've had an "InvisibleShield" (tm) on my iPhone 3G for two years, and now upgraded to the iPhone 4. My wife now uses the 3G - which is still perfectly scratchless - which she doesn't care about. So how has that helped us?TextWrangler doesn't have nearly the features that BBEdit does in terms of customization. As for "look and feel", a BBEdit window can be reduced to a fairly minimal set of interface widgets.You need more bandwidth.Yes, it is the easiest, but not always the cleanest output. v7 output the best, but things go haywire before and after that. Part of my job is to supply plain text versions of college textbooks to disabled college students. I have a lot of experience with this, and that's why I recommend Ghostscript if looking for the free option.I just gave it a try. Unfortunately, when I look at the iPod in Xcode Organizer, I can't change its provisioning profiles. Organizer just says "This device is expired and cannot be used with the iOS SDK. Please install a newer version of the OS." Do you know another way I can remove profiles?@Bryson, why you need a mobile RSS reader? Can't you read it from web browser?@Casebash my bad, move the end quotes to outside of the variable $1... updated post@TrentElligsen Google tells you have to burn the CD and boot from it to do a full defrag. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091020222135AA63T84Also, under the "Check for Update" button, it says that it will check for updates again on 10/01/2010. Does that mean iTunes isn't even going to bother looking for an updated iOS until then?You remove profiles stored on the iPhone on the iPhone itself. Just click on the cell that contains the profile that you wish to remove, and that will take you a detailed view of the profile. In there is a big, red `REMOVE` button. Can't miss it. Just be sure you aren't deleting the profile tied to the beta itself (if one is needed. I don't run the betas as a rule.)I wish there was a way to edit the default services, but I haven't been able to find anything other than statements about how they're "built into the operating system".As I said in the problem description, the iPod won't let me do anything until I've updated the OS. It just shows the "Connect to iTunes" icon and nothing else.Yes, but you can check for updates at any time by pressing that button.Thank you for your help.Wish I could accept both as answers. Thanks for the help...Is this better than the official [Wikipedia app](http://itunes.apple.com/app/wikipedia-mobile/id324715238?mt=8)?I'm happy to have anyone rewrite the post to be more structured according to overview.  I reconsidered, but I couldn't figure out how to undo it.Thanks. Sucks that Dual-Link DVI is officially only supported with an active adapter. Might bring the monitors to an Apple Store for testing I guess :/Ah. Now it's clear. I'm sure there is some file buried somewhere that you can edit, but at that point, I'd recommend heading over a Genius Bar if at all possible and let them sort it out.@Adam, Thanks, I'll fix that. I recognized that the kernel wasn't Unix by itself, and I knew there was something special about the micro-kernel, but hadn't looked into it lately.Thanks. I use KeyRemap4Macbook for mapping paragraph sign to `/~ and so far it works great for me. No crashes :-)Just a little bit better: put all your scans in a single folder and drag the folder itself into iPhoto.This answer is baffling to me. It's as if you didn't read my question at all. I was already using cut-n-paste to replace the icon. Furthermore, the .VolumeIcons.icns file whose screenshot you modified for your answer is only created _after_ changing the icon.no prob. I've seen a lot of references to OSX having a "BSD kernel" lately and it's been getting on my nerves :)@Peter: glad it worked for you!  I need to spend some more time with it because I need to extend it in order to have it do what I want :)you just need to install once your legitimate copy via bootcamp and use it via parallels-desktopyou can mark your own answer as the accepted one :)I've tried everything I can think of. Taking it to a Genius Bar is not really an option since there's not one close enough and I need the iPod ready for a software demonstration tomorrow. Any other ideas?Thanks, but I am trying to get it to work with commands from "On my command" rather than having to create new commands in automatorThe problem with that approach is that commits don't say when they each made it into which shipping version of Safari.@Dori That's actually what I was describing in the first line of my post, creating an Automator action and saving as a service.  I did it when I wrote his answer but I guess I forgot to put the part about it being a service rather than a workflow.  In my comment I was actually just lamenting that you can't just edit the default "Search With Google" action rather than creating a new one.FWIW, I've never had iPhoto launch when I sync my iPad.Sorry, I should have been more clear. I would specifically like an apple specific keyboard.While any usb keyboard will _work_, the different meta-key placement is irritating.My new backup is named "Backup"... The shell script idea is what I have in mind but I know no tool able to display and change alias contents.cut-n'-paste works every time, so, if it does not work for you, something happen, just restart and try again.

You must manually forward each step when you have passed it with your car.@gphoppe, how about the responsiveness of the phone? Does it degrade over time?The wired apple keyboard has normal arrow keys is that OK or do you need a wireless keyboard?@Dori - Ah yes, fair point. Hadn't considered that small but important issue!+1. Pretty much anything that's "loose" is only headed one direction: looser.The iPhone uses flash storage, not a magnetic medium. Its data can't be messed with by magnetic fields. Evidently a strong magnetic field can attenuate cell signal strength, but flash media are impervious to magnets.In the Mac OS (all iterations), windows maximize to the logical size of the content being viewed, not the size of the entire screen. Some have argued that Windows' behavior of maximizing to the size of the screen was simply a cheesy and lame copy of Mac OS' behavior. Either way, the technology isn't perfect, but it should help explain the majority of what you are seeing when you press the Maximize button.@Dori @Chops: That said, [the Wikipedia Safari version history page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history) gives WebKit version numbers for each Safari release, and some of the commit messages in Trac seem to refer to tags for these WebKit version numbers (see e.g. http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/9369). So it might be possible to retrospectively construct CSS-focused release notes from that.Great answer! +1You might be able to find contact details for the owner via this Google search: http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=gray+powell&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=Is the e-reader a lcd or a epaper one?Keep getting "the device isn't eligible for the requested build"can it be uninstalled? will it return to the "normal behaviour?+1 original way to think about it :)I find this quiet anoying - it there a way to cancel this behaviour.

Why use OMC?+1 can't check it now... but thank you.if don't run it the green + behave in default no need of uninstall.Adding to finder is preferable@Alex B:  There have been reports of Apple updates being incompatible with jailbreaks, although I don't remember any lately.  I haven't heard of problems that couldn't be fixed with a system restore and update, although of course that leaves you with an unjailbroken phone.  You'd think somebody around here would know the details, but it isn't me.There's something missing from your story. In OS X, Aliases will not break when the Volume is renamed.Do you want the picture itself to sync, or are you looking for scan/ocr software?Thanks Dori, I've had this sucker for a long time and for the life of me, can't remember where my system disk is. I think it's time to retire this bad boy.they will if they point to a path in /Volumes@calavara aliases are not symbolic links they link to a File ID not a pathI knew this from previous OS versions but when I searched for Image Capture I couldn't find it so I assumed it had been removed.

And how about the responsiveness of both phones? Does it degrade over time?Hmm, perhaps this website doesn't have the correct firmware. Have you tried choosing "iPhone 4" under "Download iOS 4.0.1 via direct links here:"? If you have, have you tried the dropdown list? If you can somehow get the firmware elsewhere, the instructions will still apply. (Maybe try the link in Jon Erickson's answer?)The fact that this _did not_ work for me was almost certainly a bug, because it works fine now.The 4.2 betas start 8Cxxx not 8Axxx@ghoppe: What I observe is that aliases are broken. I just want to fix them as a whole and I don't know how. The main missing part of my story, I'm afraid, is inside the Finder. As far as I know, aliases contain not only a File ID, but also a path and many other informations that a hidden algorithm uses for alias resolution. If I use the `strings` command on my failed aliases, I observe that they do contain a full path to `/Volumes/Backup/...`. Anyway, I begin to think that symbolic links with a relative path might be a more robust solution in my case.There are more apps in the iPhone AppStore than there are apps in the Android Market. I've found iPhone apps to be more polished, meaning more functionality, better graphics, attention to detail. Neither of them degrade in performance over time. Android performance can degrade if you use too many widgets on your home screen.Preferably wireless, but you are right, the normal keyboard (full sized) is pretty good (I'm actually typing on one right now ... I use it at work for windows programming, yuck).I would say yes, but this of course is subjective.@Asaf: not very original to be honest :-) I learned about it from another thread on this site.This is a "forum-like" question. Not a Q&A one. This question will be obsolete in 2 weeks or 2 hours :-)Are you not able to highlight the value next to "Where:" and press `CMD+c` to copy it?You could try to reword your question to something like "Is <date> a good time to buy a Macbook Pro". So that people can answer base on the schedule Apple usually follow when launching or upgrading products. But even then, it may be too localized considering the secrecy around Apple's product.@ayaz consider writing that as an answer, since it's probably the best way to do what he's asking :)I'm afraid it's even worse, you have to put the SIM from another carrier, AND plug into iTunes.Doesn't work for me...I'm under the assumption that Handbrake only encodes disks, not pre-existing videos.But, what applications, if any, should I use to convert my existing library?I used a standard account (not an admin) for my tests.  I ran the commands using sudo.  It is weird that minutesUntilFailedLoginReset isn't in man.  Thanks.yeah i know about macrumors. I think we are just in the middle of the cycle, but I wanted to hear opinions of Apple users.ok I've edited the questionI'm curious about why you would need a folder for one icon?My point is that if your existing library is already in iTunes, no need to convert!@Chris: Actually, I saw a video of a demo of the iOS 4.2 beta for iPad (http://www.macrumors.com/2010/09/28/ios-4-2-beta-2-and-itunes-10-1-beta-seeded-to-developers/) and noticed a folder containing one icon. Curiosity got the better of me, thus the 'elegant' request :-).I don't know why but this doesn't work for me. There is no selection at all in this dialog.Is there a way to create a Disk Image instead, and mount it when I think a copy is needed ?This is great but you can't zoom in or out using ? + or ? -.Thanks Stalker, I had my HDD tested and one of the arms is right off it's rocker@ghoppe: they do contain a path... check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_%28Mac_OS%29.  Particularly the section "Preventing Alias Failure", and the statement "It is similar to the Unix symbolic link, but with the added benefit of working even if the target file moves to another location on the *same* disk", and "The original may be moved to another place *within the same filesystem*, without breaking the link."@calavera yes, I know they contain a path, but they also link to a file ID. And yes, I know they break if they're moved to a different filesystem. This does not invalidate my point. An alias will **not** break if the volume containing them is renamed. They were broken when the target file was moved.@ghoppe: I suspect that the failure was introduced during backup procedure. I use SuperDuper.@mouviciel Yes, that's right. Sorry for being pedantic about how they broke. I'm just picking nits. I guess we're both half-right. They broke because the files were copied from External -> Backup so the File ID could no longer match. When you renamed the volume Backup to External, the file path no longer matched, so the second redundancy in the alias could no longer find the file. Both methods used by the OS to find the file could no longer find the file.Thanks for your answer. I know about both shortcuts, but I'm specifically looking for a single keyboard shortcut solution to switch between all open windows.What OS version do you have?mkalias looks interesting! But the latest version is dated 2003 and the technical note mentioned is for Mac OS 9... If I find nothing else, I will try to update it for Snow Leopard...That's just exactly what I was looking for.

The battery was down to 90% capacity within about a week...

Might help get it implemented...That's why I'd like the unread status to expire automatically. Marking them unread isn't a long-term solution.You can use Login Items in the Accounts section of System Preferences to do this.As it says at [HandBrake 0.9.3: Released!](http://handbrake.fr/?article=9) (and also on the front page of their site): " **Universal input** - HandBrake is no longer limited to DVDs: it will now accept practically any type of video as a source.""MacBook Pro's aren't going to be updated until at least January" ... really? :-(Thanks, I know about it but I suppose to get answers based on personal experience.When is Witch slow? I've just started using it.Community wiki? Self answer?Any application that [cannot receive files or file contents after a drap and drop](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/Tasks/DraggingFiles.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001288-CEGJFDFG) will give you the filename instead. So this not only works with Terminal, but also with TextEdit or other "simple" apps.You can also alter the smart mailboxes to only show those where date received is > some dateYes, but I don't shut down my Mac except for a weekly reboot on Monday mornings.This works perfectly.  I have it just in pages and was going to export it PDF, at least that was the plan.Why would glyphboard not be available outside the US? It's a web app that works offline, not an app installed through the App Store. I'm in Sweden and it works just fine.@jakemcgraw I encode videos with it every day. I haven't used Handbrake to encode actual discs in close on a year. The source can be any video, and I am using it at the moment to prep about 4000 videos for Apple TV.What OS are you on? Mac OS 10.6 has much improved disk management than the previous versions.I guess you are using DHCP, right? Some people report setting IP manually fixes the problemwhich version are you on? If I right click on the path, I get the standard edit menu with `Copy` in itthat's not even an interesting question. I think it's one of the first things you learn how to do, just like turning the device off.My office and home networks use DHCP and the disconnection issue went away with the upgrade to 10.6.I would suggest that you use the SVN version of Handbrake to get the latest presets.@Dori, I'm looking at something like this: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10456561-233.htmlI have my personal mail and my office mail configured in Mail.app. I would want to see the separate unread counts. _Thought_ this might be helpful. Now that you say _I still don't get why..._ it has got into my head whether it would really be helpful... will try and let you know :-)Ha! So obvious! Thanks, mate!I have the same (2 personal accounts, 1 company account, plus 2 more for my own companies), but I still dont get it ... every time it has a number, I check it. period. :)Great question; I'd also like to know if this is possible.Many thanks for this script! I am not an Applescript expert so I won't try to upgrade it. I think that a possible solution lies between Applescript and bash with its powerful `find`. Thanks again!Sorry, I miss-typed. I meant mark then all as READ.The correct path to the Spotlight Search is Settings->General->Home Button->Spotlight SearchYou should have added that as an answer, as it appears to answer your question. I've done so; if you want to also add it, I'd be happy to delete mine.@Dori, the product I mentioned in my link didn't mention any Google Docs integration, so it's not my choice.Nice research, but I doubt the OP (or anyone) is currently running 10.2. I believe most old Macs have Panther at least and those still having Jaguar are too old to even have problems :)I think this is version specific. Certainly, on my phone running 4.1 it is as I wrote above.I'm guessing he is using 10.6 since he tagged the question with "snow-leopard".Is this a permanent flag that is being set? Doesn't just hitting the `refresh` button not sort things out if the site is back up?I've to close the session and then i works when I logon again... I think the problem occurs when my modem is on, but when the connexion to internet is not yet available. Maybe it's the modem that keeps to give this "bad" answer ?Thanks. I shouldn't've used "travel case". I meant something more along the lines of a laptop sleeve, but for an iPod -- just couldn't think of the term. I updated my question to reflect this.I would love to have this for my MacBook Pro.  I use 2 finger tap/click for right clicks and it would be great if control click emulated a middle click!this is only Proofing Tools, this does not change the GUI. But thank you for pointing me that this part is already shipped with the Office.I'm using snow-leopard indeed. I have SMB connections to windows network share. I'm using admitmac and logging in with an Active Directory ID. I use DHCP. The server connections are truly interrupt, but the problem is that the disconnect all button gives me the spinning beach ball of death.Sounds great, i will try it :-)This question might also be helpful: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2789/how-can-i-map-a-middle-click-to-control-clickThis is where my "answer" was meant to go :) :       
I love you Chealion... MiddleClick does the trick for me. I can now close tabs and open links in new tabs with trackpad taps!!!When I purchased my unlocked iPhone from the Apple Store, I had to ensure that my SALES RECEIPT indicated no contract, which would prevent the phone from being locked once a SIM was inserted.  Further reading here: http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1664561-Unlocked-iPhone-Purchases-Actually-Locked@calavera: Ha! Just glad to help. MiddleClick made life browsing much easier.The idea is great, but it never worked fast enough and stable enough for me (using latest MacBook Pro and iPad), so it works for show-off, but not for actual productive work. Of course, it's maybe something wrong with my particular setup and YMMVThanks for the update... while it didn't make it any *more* accurate, it seems doing the figure 8 with a compass-relevant app open does affect the calibration-- no need to wait for a prompt.Good point, Dan... thanks for the insight!I probably will do this, but not from eBay. I prefer iFixit (or anything) over eBay.The price probably fell since iPhone 4 came out.Have you thought about an iPad? The app store has many typing apps targeted towards education.Is it just me, or does that first screenshot not look right? The eject icons look different, and there are usually two buttons at the bottom of the window instead of one.That is correct, my brother has a Spanish version of Office 2008 for MacDo you have MySQL installed by default? It's not on my system, even though I do have devel tools installed.@Moshe the phone fell, the price fell ...i think you've helped me identify what i like, which is seeing my typing page relative to a background (or a "real page" as you say). I like Word because it's like having a blank sheet of paper on your desk. Why would you ever put the piece of paper in the upper left corner of your desk? You wouldn't...you'd put it in the center. I love most desing decisions with Macs, but I use SizeUp because I like my windows expanded fully, and while I may be able to get used to Pages as it is, I think having the option to lay it in the center (at about 150%) is preferable.@bmargulies - :-)Now that you mention it I'm thinking I had to install it on my MBP but it was installed on our server.  mySQL should be available at http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/@Chealion: ah, didn't know that. Thanks.@Victor: It's one I didn't find out about myself for a while (well, a day or two, but it's relative!). Turning the device off is pretty intuitive - like almost everything about using the iPad - but taking a screenshot isn't, IMO. It's something that you would never guess, only stumble across through trial and error, or discover via the web.You can use iMovie Picture in Picture mode to do that, even if post-production can be really painful.+1 just for #3 alone.OmniGraffle Pro reads Visio's binary files, not just their XML ones.  That was worth it by itself for me.  Also, FWIW, I much prefer OmniGraffle to Visio in terms of ease of use.  My coworkers often comment about how nice the diagrams are.The main problem is that you can't really split clips in picture-in-picture mode. Audio synchronization is also a pain. But for very simple things it's fine.Isn't ? + f 'Find'?I use 1Password on OS X, Windows and iPhone, all synced together via Dropbox and it works great!what about the screen? Let's say if my hands are oily and I touch the screen, will that make the screen oily too?@JFW: Not while you're in Slideshow mode. There it resizes to "Fit to screen", but not back to "Actual size". You can also do it with the on-screen button bar.1) My MacBook is brand new - using it since 1 week. 2) It happens with ALL server connections. 3) A server log is irrelevant, as I wake up my mac away from any servers.The solution is what I do now. But I want something other than force restart. Restoring connectivity is only possible if I travel back to the office. I'd rather force restart. :)@Ngu Soon Hui - As long as you can still hold onto it, it'll be okay. When it gets too slippery to hold, you'll want to wipe it on your shirt.What is not irrelevant is 2) Does it happen with ANY server connection? 3) By server connection I meant console output from YOUR computer.According to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306759, the Mac client won't work with non-default port numbers, which for me is a fatal flaw.  However, I decided to try it anyway, and sure enough, it worked.  Thanks.Next time this happens (which will probably be by mid-week) I'll give the airplane mode switcharoo a try and report back with my findings. Thanks!I guess that's the problem... I'm on 3.2 (Wi-Fi model), and that setting doesn't exist.I saw something about it syncing via MobileMe, is that the only way to sync it?Sounds lovely, but with buying separate licenses for a Mac, a PC and the iPhone it gets fairly expensive. I'll keep it in mind, though!I'd given up on CoRD myself, and gone with the standard MS RDC client. And, as you've since discovered, it works fine with non-standard ports (I don't think I have a 'standard' port anywhere in the entire estate!).Closing session is not enough. I've to reboot the Mac to access those websites. That's why I think the Mac is involved, not the modem.I just got the filename in the clipboard. How Do You get the full path ?Thanks for that clarification, JonikI am fairly certain that isn't the issue. For example if I buy an app it records the purchase just fine and it is waiting for me in iTunes the next time I log in, it just seems to want to force me to download it from the computer instead of over Wifi.Can you post the output of your ifconfig and the output of: cat /etc/resolv.conf (in Terminal.App of course)Thanks Martin, so would you say the bulk of the power goes to powering the antenna then? I really don't know how much power that takes. Ie, what percentage of the power a radio uses is to power the antenna vs everything else.

It just seems that since they've been making GPS receivers since the 80's a modern 1ghz processor with a dedicated GPS chip shouldn't have that hard a time decoding and processing 50bps * 4+ satellites. 

Likewise, I understand how AGPS works, but my phone is doing that stuff anyway when it checks for email or I browse the web.Are you sure the wi-fi network (and the connected network) you are doing this on is reliable? Even my AirPort Extreme drops out periodically. You've pretty much eliminated all of the other possibilities in the responses.The oleophobic screen on the iPhone is surprisingly awesome at keeping itself clean, and easily wiped off if it gets dirty.I've left my iPhone at iOS 4.0.1 entirely to keep it jailbroken so I can use MyWi with my wifi iPad. No other reason.@Philip - I suppose you can never be 100% sure, but other apps that use the Wifi connection seem to operate normally on the same network. I'm still thinking it is a firewall issue of some kind. Does anyone know what ports are used for app downloads?This morning the WiFi didn't work - toggling the airplane mode did the trick - much faster than rebooting the iPod Touch! Thank you for a workaround for this problem.1 and 2) It sometimes resolves immediately, other times sucks as hell. That is what's so baffling. I actually ran "time nslookup" and "time dig" commands and I get weird behavior.

3) My DNS servers are definitely correct. I use OpenDNS because I want Google to at least not know all my porn habits.

4) I do see some weird kernel.log messages with VMWare info... (vmnet: VMNET_SO_BINDTOHUB: port: paddr vmnet: bridge-en1: media 80 dev 0x89f2404 family 2vmnet: Invalidating peer info for hub: 0, port: 0vmnet: VNetUserIfFree: freeing userIf at 0x9e8df00.) I'll have to look into this more. Thanks!@Lizzan:  Nope, I sync to my Mac without that.  Requires opening up desktop app & phone app at once and asking both to synchronize, and having the firewall on your Mac let PasswordWallet talk to the outside world.  (Since it only does that when you're explicitly trying to synchronize, I think it's safe enough.)I seem to be able to use non-standard ports without any problem, and I'm using version 2.0.0 of Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. Just enter machinename.domain:port in the connection field of RDC.The `Shift` trick can be used to slow down many kinds of animations, too.In the finder, click once on the filename or the icon so that the file is highlighted (if you can change the filename now, you clicked to often and you must press Escape to cancel the rename operation). Then press Command-C.Yes a case will fix it, and I *have* a case. But with the case, it won't fit in the cradle I also have and it's no fun to pull the phone out of a case to put it in a cradle, so I am really looking for an ultraslimline hack = tape.appreciate the thoughts, but if I'm syncing, I'm at a computer, and have other options.  How would I upload it to a website from my ipad?  That sounds like just what I can't do on *these* websites?You can't do it on the SE sites (so far as I can figure out), but there are apps that let you (for instance) upload images to Flickr. And once it's on Flickr, you can manually create a image tag here that references the image there.I think I have 10.0 at the moment. I will check when I get home ... but it isn't as if it is removing all my folders. Just pulling new apps out of their folders.It is truly amazing though. It's well worth the money for the app. :)Sounds great! This might very well be the way to go for me.Is there a word missing in your sentence "*The iOS 4.x (not even...*"? It sounds halfway self-contradictory to me.Sounds like a great solution, but *wow* they're not ashamed of the price. Still worth considering, since 3G for iPad is more than $20, and less versatile. Thanks!How do you tap with two fingers using only one hand? :)Needs to be enabled in settings first.You fixed it, now it makes sense to me, too :-)This is a good idea. The problem is that I don't have a control group for this experiment: my "working" machine has a non-working superdrive. So I don't know what should happen, I don't know if the external screen will come on without me pressing any buttons etc. That's why I was looking for the solution that involves non-graphics mode....Will that output to the external screen? remember, them main screen isn't working, so I can't change any settings using a mouse, only keyboard actions...Incidentally, can someone please explain what the startup key combination  CMD-OPT-A-V "Force an AV monitor to be recognized as one" really does? can it be used in conjunction with CMD-S "OSX: Enter single-user mode (shell-level mode)" ? how? which combo should be pressed first?I would think at boot time you would at least see a gray screen or the blue screen later on the external monitor. Either way you need a system disk to boot from and probably a hard drive to get everything going.There are two machines in the story: One has a screen that never turns on, for a still undiagnosed reason, and no hard drive. The other has a non working superdrive. I'm trying to diagnose the screen problem, while useing the second machine as a control...Great idea, I haven't thought of this, but in this case it does not work. See edit above.In what way? It works for me in Mac OS 10.6 just fine.You're too fast. See my editied question above.Oh! Does that mean that I will loose all my 7 stars for my version 1 if I push out version 1.1. This is bad because how will the users know if that is a good app or not!Yes, but it also means that any bad ratings go away as well. All written reviews remain, however. It is common practice to withhold certain easy, minor fixes and updates to give more opportunities to reset numbers if need be.Well! I have all good ratings but I also like to provide a new version of the app with new features. What can I do?thanks a lot man!You'll want to double-check my facts, but I don't think there is anything you *can* do about that.I wouldn't say that you lose your ratings, users can still see the ratings for previous versions.awesome! thanks for the answer. I will go ahead and update the app with new features. Thanks!On most Mac systems, `cron` is replaced by launchd. There is no /etc/crontab by default, for example. That was moved to launchd.It seems like Airfoil only supports old-style audio streaming via the technology that has existed in the Airport Express. It definitely seems like they would want to upgrade it for video, but it doesn't look like they have yet.ya i do it all the time just by adding ":<portnumber>" onto the end@Stefan - Your right.  I forgot about that change, which Apple did in Tiger.doesn't work for me either, just the filename is copied.thanks for the attempt philip, but auto-opening isn't my question. whether the setting is to auto-open or not, Preview still opens in the background, instead of the foreground.this ended up being a little too labor intensive and manual for me :PI'm guessing, then, that whatever event each app uses to open the file determines whether it opens to the front or in the back, much like adding or omitting the `activate` keyword in Applescript. In other words, this could just be developer's choice here."About this mac" says I'm running 10.6.4. I'm also forced to use ADMitMac, maybe that's why the eject button looks weird.tl;dr version: Saturdays at 3:15 AM local time.Wow, that is odd and annoying. That's the problem with Apple not continuing to update the software for old devices. There really is no option for us but to buy a new one. Oh well.Just to clarify: are you saying that the otherwise-working PB will not boot if the external monitor is attached?I just checked it. It works when pasting into Terminal but not into TextEdit.

Dragging and dropping a file into Terminal pastes the filename and path. Dito in TextEdit. What about other applications?Sorry I didnt see your update before updating my answer ... I know it looks suspicious but I didnt copy you :)Thanks! Is there an iPhone app which can read/edit the same password data file? I'm already using Password Safe/Password Gorilla with Dropbox to sync between my Macs and PCs, but I haven't found an iPhone app to interact with them.I have since tried (1) setting the channel to a fixed value (and back to auto), (2) turning wifi off and on again, and (3) rebooting.  The problem persists.  :-(+1 for the official word, but note that there are inofficial ways.I'm confused. Are you saying there doesn't seem to be any performance problem, or you only now noticed a performance problem? Did you notice the issue with the 4.0 version?You could save yourself the trouble and just pretend to take a picture, then show your friend an image from the "Photos" app. Har har. (Can you tell I'm not much entertained by such apps?)@torbengb, I afraid that my hands are not fast enough for this@Dori: no, I'm saying that when I connected the functioning PB to an external screen and booted it up, I did not get an interesting output on the screen until I when in manually (after login and such) and changed the resolution setting in the external display configuration panel. This I cannot do without the main display.@Warren Also you can type in the servername /console to get access to the running admin console.I like this. This is (somewhat) simpler than pulling out the functioning HD from PB2 and putting it in PB1. So, I can set up PB2 so that it connects to external display and boots password-less etc. Once I can get it to show something on the external screen without needing to press a button from boot, I boot it in Target disk mode, connect BP1 to it via firewire and boot PB1 normally. PB1 should boot from firewire and thus do exactly what PB2 did....Right? I'll try it out and let you know what gives.Good answer. What about virtualbox or vmware?Don't think it works. At least not in the US. Apple is paranoid about validating the billing address. These cards I believe don't have a billing address. Are these the virtual versions of the prepaid Visa cards sold at Target and elsewhere?VirtualBox does have an EFI emulation mode now, but I'm not sure how well it works. Apple's license agreement forbids using OS X client within a virtual machine. (OS X server, on the other hand, can be virtualized, as long as it's on an OS X server host with a separate license key.)hmm, irritating. OK, thanks!@Paul: following link may be helpful, and there is obviously a lot more info out there via google about running OS X in virtualbox:  http://lifehacker.com/5583650/run-mac-os-x-in-virtualbox-on-windowsGood to know. Thanks.I like your setup. Ergonomics is very important to me. Switching between the two should reduce RSI. I think I'll get them both.;-)Yeah, the Magic Mouse does seem to be a trackpad in mouse form factor. I think I'll go for both devices then I'll have the best tool for the task at hand when the need arises.I have a feeling that apple on allowed Opera through the app store approval process because it is so poor and they wanted to show them upHaha, that's a good one @gnuchu.There is, called iKeepass, but it's currently only available in the US and Canada. I'm in the UK so can't try it, so have no idea if it's any good. It does seem to work with DropBox (http://ikeepass.de/bl0g/?p=175)+1 nice info tanx+1 Automator might be the easier of the two ways to do this. I don't use it because my daily needs are for more advanced and I sometimes forget it even exists.Oh, I wasn't aware of the distinction.  I'm afraid they're dead, although the occasionally seem to come back..  I remember it being a straight line across the screen at one point, now and then there is a little gap.Another difference is that command-line tools (i.e. anything that uses Posix file APIs) won't understand aliases, just symlinks.  Both will work for GUI applications.I think he wants something else, he wants your experience about RDC and something else at the end, I don't get what exactly he means.I was hoping to see why I can't boot into other discs, but perhaps I'll have to use the 10.5 one. Do you know if this is safe to do? I know the version of the tools is different.If necessary, you can connect the Dock to VGA adapter to a VGA-DVI adapter, and then connect that to a DVI-only projector as well.Dori, I just googled and it may be possible. Please let me know otherwise. http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB442Z/A@Gnuchu - no, it was not political. Opera Mini is actually a remote viewer for a web browser session running on Opera's servers. Due to this, it passed all the Apple tests and they had no grounds to reject it. http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opera-mini-web-browser/id363729560?mt=8@dotnet-practitioner You would also need the Camera Connection Kit for that to even have a chance of working, because the stock iPad doesn't have a usb port. USB keyboards work with the kit, but I doubt this would, since there would have to be drivers in iOS to support it.@dotnet-practitioner - if you read further down the page you linked to, there are two questions in the Q&A section about precisely this. And again, the answer is "No." In [Dear Aunt TUAW: Will my MacBook Air Ethernet adapter work with my iPad?](http://www.tuaw.com/2010/07/19/dear-aunt-tuaw-will-my-macbook-air-ethernet-adapter-work-with-m/), TUAW came to the same conclusion as well.As I post in this post (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2992/whats-the-tool-that-can-do-some-actions-when-a-file-is-copied), I found that the automator action doesn't work with link, but with alias.Note that not all applications support video out, so make sure the app you want to use supports it before you spend 30 bucks on the VGA adapter.@gnuchu, I concur. That's why Apple store is not showing Chrome because Chrome beats Safari to death.+1 - I would have said much the same. You get much better precision with a real mouse, but when you don't need pixel-perfect movements, then a touchpad is a lot more comfortable *because it's zero-force*. I'm not using a Mac or a "magic touchpad" but the original FingerWorks multitouch devices. (Apple bought FingerWorks, and their touch tech is what you're seeing now.)A sincere warning against the magic mouse! It's neat as a mouse, but it's too small for any serious amount of gesture commands. Don't get me wrong, the device works (probably; lack of personal experience) but the touch surface is sized and positioned in such a way (because a mouse just isn't very big) that force you to move your fingers in awkward ways, so you are much more likely to develop RSI problems. For this reason alone, I would always recommend a regular mouse (if you need one), plus a separate multitouch surface (if you want that).+1 Flash is terrible.+1 it's nice but it's not a real OS X hidden features it's good 3rd-party apps.@shaun can you put it's photo I can't find this in my OS X 10.6.4you mean you want open your gmail in browser?@Am1rr3zA, if it's possible, yes. But the most annoying thing is the Mail.app popping up...I figured it would fall into the "nice tips & tricks" part of the thread :)Maybe is should have been...

See: http://i.awe.to/HRA3He seems to know that he needs to download it; he's asking *how* to do it.You might want to edit your question to clarify that you want to download the MP3 (or at least cache it) using just the iPod itself, if this is, in fact, what you want to know.thanks for the great screenshot step by step, but it still doesn't show on the News Feed. :(Reading this again and thinking out aloud but does it support 64Bit or is it using 32Bit?Thanks, SimplyRar seems okay. I wasn't sure which answer to accept, but I guess this one, as Simplyrar is free (as in cost), has GUI, and you mentioned it first. :)Thanks, good to knowAh, I somehow overlooked that. I guess "Phone" was just too obvious. :)Lingon is just an app to make creating the .plist files for launchd more user friendly. Also someone made a web based launchd plist creator: http://plist.spotmac.de/I don't think you can but stuff from the US iTunes stores from outside the US. EULA says : "US Sales Only". Apple claims that they'll enforce "using technology". When I'm abroad, I can't even buy stuff even if the credit card has no problems.Just be aware of the bug that the Boot Camp partition sometimes disappears from the startup disk screen. I recommend using refit if your going to use NTFS-3G.indeed very strange. i've checked the settings on FB web and I did a reset of all settings... still not working.I cannot live without this...absolutely essential!Yes, the setting is there but it doesn't seem to work in all applications. It works in Firefox (on most pages), but not in Chrome, for example.I agree that while Webmailer gets the job done, this might be the best solution for many users.  Plus, it's made by Google.if you click on the arrow for an album, you'll see all songs in that album while hold Option it brings you all artist's song not all of you album song! at least it works like this for me.Yep, this doesn't work with "Protected AAC" files; iTunes refuses to "Create AAC Version" for those. Other than that, great instructions!What do you mean by MobileMail? The Mail app on the iPhone?@Lizzan: That might be an application specific issue. I'm guessing it maps to the "Home" and "End" keys, perhaps Chrome doesn't recognize those?+1. A better option for Mac users. Pros: 1) Possibility to adjust the volume (gain, amplitude) level somewhat ( [like this](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=3128573&postcount=7) ). 2) When you use the "Send Ringtone" option, GaradeBand automatically "remixes" the song so that it'll sound better on the (obviously crappy) phone speaker. This is easy to notice if you pay attention to deep bass sounds: their pitch is raised. (To avoid this, you could export as .m4a file, then rename that to .m4r as in Jeff's answer.) As for cons, "Protected AACs" won't work in GarageBand either.Another option for emergencies is to create [a bootable SD card](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553). I bought a 16GB card for this, and then installed SL + utilities. It works great.Awesome security is right.  Steve Gibson did a security review of it in Security Now episode 256 ( http://twit.tv/sn256 ).  Full synchronization and off-line capabilities too.  One time passwords, two factor authentications, etc.Have you added the trap command to your /Users/YourUsername/.profile ?@Martin Yeah I have. I have confirmed a few time now.Does NewsRack allow offline reading?I would have thought so too, but it seems it's not that simple. "Home" and "End" work in Chrome, three-finger swipe doesn't.What email address did you use? I don't see any address published prominently on the iTunes support site.Apple gets very uptight when people start dropping files and plugging flash drives on their In-store Macs.Well, that sucks. As you say *yet*, do you happen to know of any evidence that it might be added in a future iOS version?No evidence, but Apple has a trend of constantly improving its phone features, as it did when it allowed the sending of a message to multiple recipients, sharing contacts, etc., so we'll just have to be hopeful.@Philip Well, it would be well-advised to ask one of the Apple Store staff for permission first, but I've heard they're generally obliging as long as they oversee the process. YMMV.[Illustration](http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/iPhoneScreenshot.jpg) to complement your answer. :-)Do USB devices even work at all with the iPhone?How old's your MacBook Pro?+1 for a good question! Normal phones have had this basic feature for more than a decade, and yet it's still missing in the iphone. Boo Apple!Though for this specific feature, they haven't added it in any of the last releases. How many releases has there been so far, twenty?! I wouldn't hold my breath. Yet another reason to jailbreak and look for non-Apple-approved hacks.Thanks. In the end, I just used the keyboard layout provided in the disk image and edited it by hand. I wonder why these layouts are not provided with the system (or are they?)-1. Menubar monitors won't help if you have the lid shut. Best you can do is check *before* you shut the lid.can you post a sample file?I'm afraid no: it's copyrighted work...OK, could you try converting a public-domain audiobook, like the ones available from http://librivox.org/? If they, too, exhibit an issue you can post them here for people to test.Yeah I suppose they are somewhere, but not in any Keyboard Layouts directory.I didn't (don't) know that this requires my Mac, at all.  The iPod documentation is almost nonexistent.  Lots of things I thought were impossible, and weeks later discovered a way.  Other things I assumed were possible, and after much trying, have come to believe are simply disallowed (or I'm not smart enough to figure it out).  How does anyone decide that something is not possible on iOS?  You've tapped and shook and turned and shouted at it every possible way?Is it that bad? Well, I'll keep the question open, this may be resolved when iOS 4.2 is released.ClipMenu is nice because it's free :Pway too subjective... voted to close@calavera I add your quote :PI completely agree, but my concern is that my phone was idle when I got the message and cool to the touch, so something was up. It hasn't happened since though so I'll just keep an eye on it.@zneak : How do I tell? I did not purchase this computer, it's a work computer (I could ask our admin, but he's out today).You can tell by opening the Apple menu and clicking "About this Mac". Then, click the "More infos" button. Click the "Hardware" element in the left tab. There, you'll find the Model Identifier, which is what we need. (For instance, my current-gen MacBook Pro is a `MacBookPro6,2`.)@zneak : I updated my question with the information.Done. Edited the question accordingly.Incorrect there are many other ways to do this.@Lizzan: it's because Chrome does not support the up and down 3 finger swipe.  It support left and right (back and forward).  You can't do it on a macbook touchpad either.4.1 *doesn't* resolve those issues, in all cases at least, my old 3G was a testament to that. (Though I've compared it to a way less sluggish 3G, so I guess it depends on things like what you've got installed on the phone.) But you're right about 3GS.@kchau You also need a keyboard or mouse.There are programs / utilities that will wake your computer and burn battery life. That's why it's best to shut it down instead of sleeping if you aren't simply moving to another location.for encoding or decoding or both?@calavera: Both.Can you get FFmpeg to build natively on 10.6.2? Mine hangs on configure.@Josh K: You may want to try using MacPorts or a different package manager instead to get a working copy.@Chealion: I try to stay away from those as much as possible, but it looks like it only has 0.5.1 available as a package anyways.MacPorts currently has FFmpeg 0.6 available.@Josh K: Fair enough. Most of the less expensive "converters" are just GUIs to FFMPEG and related utilities.@sentinel: I'll double check, I my search returned 5.1...Accepting because it's the correct answer and at the core of 90% of the encoding programs.@Martin, Yes, that's what the answer says... I was adding that I think you also need an external monitor.Locale - what a cool app! Perhaps someone will make (has made?!) an app for jailbroken phones. Makes me sad that Apple locks the devices so much.Thank you. The solution was in there. I had the trap command in .profile and not in .bashrc. Moving it fixed the problem completely and it now works as expected.I know. But I'm wondering how we can actually achieve it, not if/when/why Apple might do it.Yes, jailbreak seems necessary to achieve this.Actually, if I were to be pedantic about this you have to set it for all albums involved, if you just set it for Ratatat and not for Aphex Twin Ratatat will be above Aphex Twin, which is the incorrect order.Not that that really matters, it's just kind of revolting to have to modify my tags to work around iTunes' shortcomings.Correct, you have to set it for all albums involved. What I meant is that you do not need to go about setting it for the noninvolved albums, which form the vast majority of your iTunes library.I did a MacPorts update (took a half and hour) found ffmpeg 0.6 and installed it (took a few hours). Overall this works, thanks!Very interesting indeed!Also: In iOS 4 and newer, you can move your finger farther above or below the slider (without taking it off the screen) to scroll faster or slower.Apparently shift-clicking the green (+) doesn't have any effect on fully maximising the applications. Are you sure that this works?Doesn't really work-Has the same effect of normally clicking the + button.Speaking of Airfoil, though ... I had been thinking of picking up an old Airport Express to plug into my soundbar via optical and stream stuff via iTunes & Airfoil.  But with AirPlay taking off, maybe this doesn't make sense?This seems to be the most correct answer, but wouldn't it be better to put the text rather than just a link?I can use this to change the font, but the "Text Color" and "Document Color" options don't actually seem to do anything.Are you asking about using the existing external display with both the iMac and the laptop, or using the iMac's internal display for both itself and the laptop's external display?3Gs also has sluggishness issues.  There is an office full of people with 3Gs here who are testament to it.  The issues are not as bad as 3G, but they do exist.  Switching from app to app is slower.  The iPod part is slower to move between podcasts.  These are just few of the issues.Just to follow up, I did upgrade to 4.1 and it did resolve some issues with the iPod sluggishness.@Dori I'd like to use iMac's internal display.I tried all these apps and Iconbuilder and found img2icns just fit my need and work fine for me. however Iconbuilder is great too but it's a little expensive.I've rewritten my answer to provide the facts rather than the link. (Thank you caliban!) Note: Free apps are included in the purchase history because they are also purchased, at cost $0.00.I wonder why there are waiting to have the wheel gesture made available on touch screen. This was really a better way to navigate !Unless you delete them from iTunes.I have RCA there, but there's no way to have 1080p with RCA =/+1 for the phrase "running around like ancient Chinese warlords"Ken, there is no built-in application in iOS that allows you to download MP3s. The only thing Safari can save is an image (which goes into your photo library). The procedure I outlined in my answer will work, and it only takes a couple of minutes. It probably takes less time than it took you to respond to Tim's post.It looks like Stay would work, but I'm not going to upgrade my OS just for this.Actually, Martin, the Macbook has never had a full-size DVI port. It has had (in order): mini-VGA, mini-DVI and finally mini-DisplayPort.@Ben Thanks, fixed.My bad. Seems like you're right. I've tried Google but all results seem to point to the fact that you're stuck with the default colour. Sorry.It was valid outside the US, I'm in Sweden and I got a free case through the app.Good to know. Thanks for the clarification!@Nick ok thanks, so let's say I have a 500GB hard disk (and I don't use big files.. just work and programming..) what a good ratio for a partition ? what about 300GB for my files and 200GB for time machine ?That depends entirely on how big your "work and programming" files are. Maybe you work in Final Cut Pro (big files) or just textedit (small files)?@Ben The pro had a full display port at one point, I have one.@Philip Regan yeah.. that's true and a good point.. thanks. I have a backup for that (I do it manually...). However I wanted to use time machine just to recover files (such as when I erroneously save some text file and I lose code.. etc). What do you think a good ratio should be ? (500GB hard disk)@Nick ok. No.. just web and mobile development (no big files). Is not possible to decide which folders to backup right ? It would be greatYou can choose to *not* back up certain folders, which could be most of your drive if you choose.If you already have another drive for hosting files, then why partition this new drive? Just leave it as is.Nice!  Do you have one?I have tested my iPhone 3GS with an Apple Wireless Keyboard. You will most likely have to unpair the keyboard from any computer it is paired with before pairing it with the iPod Touch.Did you follow the link in my answer? The solution given there uses HDMI for video and RCA for audio. Is there any reason that wouldn't work for you?If you're currently running Leopard and your Mac can handle Snow Leopard, there's no good reason *not* to upgrade. SL is faster, slimmer, and better in a huge number of ways. Given its price, it's worth every penny.I agree with Dori on not worrying about the overall "VM size" entry on the Activity Monitor.  For me, Firefox seems to slowly grow to consume all memory.  It may be related to using lots of tabs.  Quitting it periodically frees up substantial ram for me.  My machine in general never has a problem -- uptime 22 days and counting.@Nick ok cool, so then.. this change everything, because If I only backup text files folders.. I just need few GB for the back up right ?@Philip Regan: Because I need automatic backups on short-time period mistakes.. such as overwriting wrong files etc. In other words, I want an immediate backup, (every time I save a file)What happen when I create new folders and new content ? I guess it depends if the new folders have as parent a backed up folder or not... could you confirm this ?(Second question) I actually need to backup only few folders... is it going to be horrible job to exclude my entire hard disk beside few folders ?Somebody should try this and report here what is his/her conclusion, because it will be a nice trick !Using the same disk for system and time machine makes sense only if you want to be able to retrieve deleted files on a laptop. Combining this with an external backup of both partitions would be wise.Right. I get that part, I use TM at home. What I think is confusing a lot of people is why you feel the need to partition the disk. Because based on your comments, you don't.@mouviciel That's exactly what I have explained in the comments below. I should have added to the question.@Philip Regan OK, so.. well let's say I exclude all folders and I decide to backup only few of them (mainly text files).. how big should the partition be ? What about 50GB ?Does this work for you guys? I'm probably doing something wrong :-( Basically I got list of my podcasts.+1. Maybe not so high on the "practicality" scale, but oh, OH so gorgeous.Don't partition. If you all you are going to be doing is using this new drive as a back up and not manually any files on it per your other comments, then there is no good reason to partition the drive. Just plug it in, point TM to it, and let it fly.I have improved the solution to exclude podcasts. Cheers!Your assumption about whether new folders and content will be backed up is correct. Concerning listing the folders you want to exclude, you only have to create the entire list once. If you only need to backup a few folders, you should be able to exclude most folders at the top of their hierarchy, so it shouldn't be too bad.Yes, but if you're only backing up a couple folders of text files and images I'd use a different solution - DropBox comes to mind.Cool, that's exactly what I wanted to know. Any links to places where there's discussion of the protocol analysis?@Philip Regan So again, the point is that I can't bring the drive to the office, library, etc.. the idea was to have a backup system on my laptop. That was the point of the partition.@Nick Do you mean dropbox.com service ? Is it keeping track of the old files ? I thought dropbox is sync the content and lose the old versions when it is updated.So, this is an internal disk, not an external one. Maybe that wasn't clear in the question or a bad assumption on my part, sorry.Yes, you can add a (paid) package on to the free version that backs up unlimited versions of your files.@Nick So, clearly I don't want to pay, what's the point if I can do it with Time Machine ? I guess now, the best thing is just to test it... and I will come back here to say how it is going.@Philip Regan Ok cool, I will try then to use it. And let you know. Thanks(or busy) [filler for character limit].You pay with your time. How much is it worth to you to set up dropbox and have it just work, rather than repartitioning and setting up time machine, excluding files, and moving everything safely when you get a new computer? More than $40?That's neither a feature nor a nice tip or trick.Interesting, I use Wizmouse on my Windows PCof course that deleted my links, but apparently it worked...weird. anyway thx :)@bmargulies: Full DVI yes - but never full DisplayPort.This is an awfully subjective (and a list question). Same rules as other list questions apply here. (See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82/os-x-applications-you-cant-live-without for example)@Chealion ignoring, of course, the big argument between "free" as in beer and "free" as in open-source. :) But that could be fixed with clarification from @rubayeet.Never understood why I should use an app to do what Spotlight already does. I understand people using Quicksilver from before Spotlight existed, but I don't see any reason to switch for new users. Is there one?@Chealion - I admit the question is subjective in the sense that it's tricky to distinguish a single correct for such questions. However, my curiosity is genuine. I'm not just trying to list out a few apps(that I know of) in the answer thread(as in the question you linked). I'm trying to find out such games with the help of the community.May I ask you why you want to do that? Curiosity.@ghoppe: Cool is subjective - the community here has said they want to allow list style questions like this - I just wanted to reiterate the rules that help make the list question on Apple.SE worthwhile (and allow the OP to add them to the question)deceze, correct, I mistakenly referred to a special use case, the "Find file Dialog"... had to use droplet in 10.5, but Space works fine in Snow Leopard.good answer ;-)At first i loved it, but from time to time SFTP synchronization fails with "nothing to do" even when there are modified files.Have you tried creating a new user account and executing the Software Update from that new user?Well, now I have 2 nice screens, but it is a little jarring to be watching a video on one of them and have the sound come out of the other.  Plus, I figured, why let one set of speakers go to waste?Sorry, was meant to say "... with Safari ..." instead of "... with Opera ...". Edited above, thanks anyway.You could search the app store for what's already in use, but that won't help with what's reserved.Not really, you can leave your application sleeping and be notified periodically, when there are location updates. But as Nick said, apps are very limited, Apple won't allow a 3rd party app to change system settings, for fear of a rogue app wreaking havoc.+1 I couldn't have expressed it betterThanks for the suggestions.  I'll be experimenting this weekend.I think I'll pass on the 2 sets of speakers, but you make a good argument for one.  I was hoping to avoid more cords and clutter on my desk.Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do.If you are asking for the name of a Windows program that automatically tags movie files with their info, then you should ask this question on superuser.@Che of course, what was I thinking.I like it for browsing the repository (logs, blame, etc).  I tend to use the command line for commits & updates, though.  Faster & easier.  Maybe some day they'll implement my request to search through the "blame" window or display more than one line in logs...Not just emacs, but emacs that feels like a Mac app -- at least, as much as you want it to.  (Very configurable.)Merging - oh, nice!  And here I was just a java program ("PDFSAM" for "PDF Split And Merge") for that!I use PasswordWallet for the same thing, but either seems crucial.I've never really understood these.  When do you want this?I can't say enough good things about OmniGraffle.Tidy doesn't just indent it - it also seems to delete parts of it as well!Can you give an example of html where tags are deleted as this is surprisingWhy are you trying to do this - there might be an answer depending on what you are trying to dobasically to disable it or at least change the default to something else that is overlapping with an app shortcut@Mark: Updated with codeYeah, I'm definitely looking for an automated solution. Thank you for the redirect...Thank you for the info Victor but anything less than full automation would be very tedious...This will be really great when the iron out the bugs.@Casebash I tried Tidy with your code and for me it only added tags.  http://www.copypastecode.com/46216/Could you explain the question further?What does the shortcut currently do?Iuju, now all is perfect, thanks DavidThere's been some discussion ovef at the Apple support forums (here moat notably: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2599045&tstart=0), but I haven't seen any technical discussion of the protocol by people who have it in hand. Likely to change over the next week as people start playing with their AppleTVs a bit more.For my money, I'd follow Mac geek goddess, Erica Sadun who is actively working on getting into the innards (from a software perspective) and usually posts at TUAW (such as this recent post: http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/01/apple-tv-hacking-update-airtunes-bonjour-services-dfu-mode/).You don't need two adapters. Internet sharing works fine with a singke adapter.But not from the same wi-fi you're trying to share from!  Put another way - your wifi card can either be acting as a base station (which is what you do when you share through it) or it can act as a client adapter - it can't do both at the same time.Ben: I download PDFs in iOS (using Safari and iBooks) all the time.  Also, I think you're underestimating the complete mess that iTunes syncing is.  I plugged in my iPod today, and I got a ton of alerts and questions about syncing apps and documents/photos/playlists between my iPod and the App Store and my 'library' and some weird authorization issues and I don't know what-all.  I eventually downloaded one MP3 onto my iPod but it took far longer than writing a simple comment!At least on my machine, if you choose System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing and then select "Share your connection from AirPort," the only options are Bluetooth and Ethernet. So no, an incoming Wi-Fi connection cannot be turned into an outgoing Wi-Fi connection.@calvera: Ensure your document type is set to HTML, not plain textWhere is this bashrc file?@sentinel Sure.  When I had Windows Mobile & Palm I used to be able to say, "Schedule this same appointment every 2 days" and then it would be every other day.

iOS4 doesn't do that (in the default calendar app anyway), though you can make recurring events, you can't specify every how many days.  Of course I could enter them myself, but I'm using a computer.Well then, you answered your question yourself. The provided calendar app does not support "every n days". Maybe there is a different app supporting this.@Casebash It should be in you home folder for your user account. If it does not exist, which often it doesn't, just create it.Can you name anything specific that make it better than the official Twitter app? (I'm pretty happy with that one.)It's true that with *most* apps it doesn't matter much. But I've noticed there are some, like **Skype**, that drain the battery way too much if left on the background. :-/+1, Good question, I was about to ask about this too (and about possibility to close all background apps at once, but I guess currently that isn't possible either)I'm afraid I'm pretty skeptical.  What were your selection is the "Share your connections from" and "to computers using" fields?It works if I run the command using export, but not in my .bashrc file. `CasebashMac:~ chris$ cat ~/.bashrc

I forget if I did anything or not, but it went away eventually. Perhaps a reboot?thanks- MorphX did the trick.  I'd found it in my initial search, but written it off, as it seemed to render gibberish, but I tried again, and figured out that if you set the window size too big, the app can't handle the graphics in real time, but in smaller size, it works perfectly...Great! Glad to hear it worked for you.of course I did the backup of the file first, but restoring resulted in the same issue. There must have been something wrong with the file apparently. Now it works however :)What does ls -l give for /Library/LaunchAgent/foo.plistNote: There's a discussion forum about those FingerWorks products here: http://fingerfans.dreamhosters.com/Nice question, I didn't even know that feature. Sadly, I can't give you a solution because I use windows where I can hear no sound while switching tabs by ctrl1-ctrl9Turns out it does work, but I was using Chrome most of the time to test it.There's a reason why the [BassJump Speaker](http://twelvesouth.com/products/bassjump/) requires you to add custom software for it to actually work. I don't think this can be done without external software -> perhaps as much as kernel module hacking. (I don't know what BassJump actually is on the software side, as I don't have one.)+1 for the screenshot, and for beating me to it by 15 seconds.@Casebash. I am not sure what he problem is. I copied that straight out of the `.bashrc` on my machine. The actual PS1 line I got from my Ubuntu Server since I wanted both to be the same. Also make sure you exit both the terminal and quit terminal and then reopen.@cometbill turns out I had the iPhone already connected and charging, that probably made the difference :)Thanks for the pointer -- it's the Vimperator addon. I should have checked!@Mike glad you found it!Thanks for the tip, that did it!Wow, I had no idea there was vi-mode available in bash! This is beyond sweet. Thanks!What version of OSX are you using?@Martin: added snow-leopard tag. I use latest and greatest 1.6.4.I used to see this all the time with VirtualBox on Snow Leopard. I'd love to hear an explanation for it as well.I have recently installed ghostscript and for some reason X11 starts whenever I use gs, but no windows appear. Not sure if my issue is related to yours, but I'm interested in a solution as well :-)@Mark: it gives the following: `-rw-r--r--@ 1 admin  staff  653 Oct 17 14:31 /Library/LaunchAgents/foo.plist`Can you please explain what you mean by "delete the plist file for those apps"?You might want to try at http://unix.stackexchange.com if you don't get any answers here. All I know of is `ls -l foo.txt` which will give you the rwxrwx--- string which you can convert to octal yourself (but I guess you know that already).I have learned to live with workarounds. You can paste your mail into TextEdit as plain text then copy the plain text from TextEdit and paste it into the app you want.This works. I'm just confused as to why I had to change the owner to root though. Is root the user that is used for LaunchAgents?Yes, I think so.Thanks for the reply. This freezes as well, right after the command is issued.Doesn't work...@Diago: Maybe there is another config file somewhere with higher priority?@Casebash - in the markup you give, what gets deleted? I could kind of understand what it's doing if (for instance) the empty `<title>` container is removed.I think it's assumed you'll need a new iPhone before the flash burns out.@Dory: Everything disappears!@Casebash. Doubt it. All customizations I have done to the terminal and my profile has always been in `.bashrc`. I have double checked on my side and it is correct. I am not very clued up on how it works, I really just applied what I know about Linux to get it to work for me since the rules are the same. I am not sure why it's not working in your case.I felt the same way when I discovered it was available.I understand that Apple tries to design software for dummies that don't deal with the file system, but there are also some power users forced to various reason to use Apple products, so they could add some option also for this type of usersThank for your useless advice to not manage files manually. If you'd read my question (and not only the title), you would know that I only use iTunes to sync iPod (as I can't just drag and drop my music into it).It is actually a world I don't like... but I'm forced to use it due to the iPod... By the way, I really care of my personal data: pictures, documents, ebook, music... the way I organize them in folders (and subfolders) is not what the program does.IIRC, the PPC Macs required very specific voltage and timings for the memory. The chips weren't different, per se. The machines were just much more sensitive than they are now. These days, most memory works, as long as the speed and physical size are correct.I use iTunes only for syncing, I use foobar2000 as media player. What I should change is the hardware media player, and it is something I'll do soon (at the time, I share an iPod touch as a device for testing the apps I develope and as my personal MP3 player).+1 just for making me aware of Plain Clip :)It's a 'good' idea, in that most updates install new functionality. The thinking is that the end user should see and manually approve if an app has added 'Share all my files with everyone on the internet' functionality', otherwise, anything could be added to initially innocuous looking apps. (I'm slightly 'odd' in that I read and enjoy(!) every app's update notes).+1 for the 15" MBP recommendation. The screen size of the 17" is nice, but it's not a very portable laptop, as far as I'm concerned. It can be tough going from my 21" Cinema Display to the 15" MBP, but not so much that I can't work while on the road.This sounds similar, indeed.If you'd read my answer (and not only my name since you apparently don't like my answer to your question on SuperUser), you'd would know that the fact you only use iTunes to sync iPod has no bearing whatsoever on the answer provided.  If you're asking some sort of different question, maybe you should make that question clear.And yes, I think you should definitely get different hardware, since, as stated in your profile, you "hate: Apple, iTunes, Steve Jobs, the iPhone, the iPad, Mac OS, and especially the Dock."I'm pretty sure Martin was only trying to answer the question you actually asked, not read your mind and figure out whatever it is that you're trying to get at.

That's a good tip.  Then I can drag them into "places" for shortcuts.  Cool.I had a problem with the second suggestion.  If I use "connect to server", then the directories get mounted under /Volumes.  So it seems like you have to decide whether you want to use the /net paths or the /Volumes paths to access your NFS directories and then use them consistently.

Now I have the left speaker on the left monitor outputting the left channel, and similarly on the right.  Closer to what I want.  Unfortunatley, the aggregate sound device is not controlled by my keyboard controls (fn-F10 an the like).  I've installed JackOSX but haven't got a chance to experiment.  Thanks for the help.+agreed: this is exactly how i do it in an rsync workflow I use for syncing an iTunes library.  Make sure you use Eject Volumes if you don't want the network drive to stay connected after the workflow completes.Eject Volumes is also handy if you want a "reverse" workflow. I use the procedure I outlined above as part of a workflow I run when I get to work (open programs, connect to servers and even remote into a virtual machine). At the end of the day, I have another one that disconnects all my servers and quits all my programs.Or hold power over you.Is this a CalDAV calendar? Or just an .ics file on a server somewhere?

I was worried that they'd try hook you into an iPad only deal, which I'm sure the network provider would like to do!With the correct settings, it will work :)I'm not 100% sure but if you're thinking of getting a second hand one, you need to have Snow Leopard installed for the iOS SDK, and therefore you need a Intel Mac.@nick do you have any mouse modifier like the ones in this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/3284/115 ??I have used Connect360 for the last few years. Very solid and works nice, but I would recommend Rivet above it I think.It's a nice trickyou guess these apps use more process or you know? it's was interesting for me to find a list of resource that used per apps.I know these apps increase the overall use of background processes.

So maybe there's something wrong with the Tidy configuration.Do you want to continually do this in realtime or just for a fragment that you later reproduce over and over in a loop?+1 probably the best solutionSurprised nobody asked this before.@ing0 gotcha, I was planning on that one.thanks, so you would say a 15" or 17". I have a pc thats 15.6" and I like the screen size but it really is not that portable. I am leaning toward getting a 13" and getting a 27" monitor because I think most the time I will be developing it will be at my desk. How much RAM and HD do you think it should have? Do you think a 4GB/256GB 13" 2010 Macbook Air would work for at least when I am away from my desk?See, this is why I said not to buy until after the event. :) The 13" MBA looks great. Let's see if Philip wants to chime in on this one again now that we have new hardware to evaluate.Yeah, I had heard about the event and was waiting... glad I waited, though now I have to figure out how to come up with that amount of money (a little much for a highschooler).Sorry, but I don't see where that question or its answers mention Apple-certified RAM.iCab also will mirror what you are viewing on an external display if you use the VGA adapter!The resulting format is .xls, only because I am forcing it to output like that so file associations work. As most users simply freak out with a .xml and the native viewer.Do you know of any updated icons for Snow Leopard? Love the functionality, but the icon is ugly next to the others.^^ Just checking :) Have you seen the new MacBook Airs? The 11" model looks nice, and has similar specs to my MacBook now! I just got myself a SSD drive for that, where the Air has custom flash - but it is so worth it!@ing0 I haven't personally seen them but I have seen pics and I am definitely thinking about buying one. So you think an 11" with 2GB and 128GB would be enough?At the moment I have a MacBook with 128 SSD and 4GB Ram and that's plenty. It wouldn't be as nice with less ram and you might want to get a monitor hooked up to it! More than enough to dev with though. One thing I'm not sure on is the speed of Apples custom flash memory, but it must be fast still!Are you serious?! ... I bought normal Kingston laptop-sized 1066 RAM! ... :O I have a MacBook Pro right now so it might be different in this case. ... I'm seriously scared now lol.Interesting... The thing I like about the 13" is its got a bunch faster processor and longer battery life.then you're out of luck, you cannot redownload them again for free (like you do with apps). You will need to purchase them again.Nope, nothing like that to my knowledge.To be fair, it's a tiny little touch interface. On a screen that size, you've got to make some functionality sacrifices or your app starts to look like a christmas tree--all sorts of little doodads hanging off it.#2 is impossible because the mouse absolutely doesn't move every minute. But #1 is very possible. I have many USB devices and I wonder if there is a device that just happened to be connected whenever this the screen refuses to sleep.My first try would be a simple drag-and-drop from Preview to DVD Studio Pro.@Andrew do the obvious now, try disconnecting them all and start one by one :)@Nick for some reason, your automator is trying to open /Library/InputManagers/MultiClutchInputManager.bundle which is very suspicious. Could you create a new user, log into that account and perform the same test?They came out with a new version within the last 2 weeks.@Martin: unfortunately the Zune is not marketed in my country, and then the iPod is painfully some sort of standard, as my car and my HiFi both have support for that crappy iTunes-player... ahem... fabulous MP3 player.I don't see a tag that corresponds to my model of macbookpro, and I don't have rep to create tags.That did the trick. Thanks.@Lorenzo Working with Windows CE, I see why you hate things in general ;)right after? nothing like `Software Update Tool
Copyright 2002-2009 Apple` ?? alternatively, if you `man softwareupdate` you'll get a list of options, like a simple `sudo softwareupdate -l` listing and even more useful `sudo softwareupdate -v -i -a` to have a verbose outputYup. By all reading my MBP falls in to that category. My question isn't about the card issue, it's about the chime. Or the lack of it and what that means.My understanding of the chime is that it is hard-coded into the motherboard. If it is not playing with the chime, then you probably have something wrong down to that level. It may be a simple fix, it may not, but only Apple will be able to tell you definitively.Edited to fix.  >.>Just remember: if you ever need to send it in for servicing, take out the 3rd party RAM first. Personally, I buy from (reputable) 3rd parties, as I think that Apple RAM is nearly always a rip-off. But I learned my lesson about removing it first when I got that letter.Cancel that, sentinel decided to revert it, I guess.`[macbookpro]` and `[snow-leopard]` are as precise as we have now. You can add more details to your question, though.@Casebash- *Everything* disappears? When you wrote that parts/tags were deleted, I pictured *some* stuff sticking around afterwards. Do you have a before/after example where only some parts get deleted?@Dori: Updated example@Casebash - if you try moving the `<body>` element inside the `<html>` element, what does Tidy do then? (don't forget the `</head>` tag before `<body>`)whatever, not helpful.  +1 for the question, -1 for the answer.Good ideas, but I want to do something more automated for our users.I thought it means the app has in-app purchases. That would be a lot more useful - and a more intuitive use for that + icon.I object to closing this as a duplicate. The stated "dupe" refers to setting up a physical keyboard using bluetooth and that's one thing I EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED in this question!it might not seem helpful, but it is because is true. That's why VMWare Fusion does not offer the option. However, I like your suggestion of installing to a separate disk.I checked console output and found that the most likely suspect (was talking about waking things) was my EyeTV adapter driver. Ever since I found it, the display sleeps again although I haven't changed anything. Perhaps starting and exiting the EyeTV application did the trick.@Andrew Glad you found the fix. :)I admit my comment is a bit off the cuff, but I grow tired of seeing these types of responses to perfectly reasonable questions on this site. This community seems heavily skewed towards obeying every word of the Apple EULAs. Without starting another long debate regarding the legality/morality of license agreements or the tenets of fair use, I'll simply state that this is not in any way an answer to the question that was asked. If Juri was unable to keep silent about the licensing restriction, he/she should have made this a comment and not an answer, or put forth a vote to close the question.Nikos, please provide more information or I fear this question will end up voted to a close...Ah, can I comment with a reputation of 1? I don't know right know. Whatever: installing it in a VM is breaking the law so the only answer is: it's not allowed, therefor it is blocked, therefor it is not possible to install Tiger in VMWare Fusion. This answers Fishtoasters question one ("Any idea how I'd go about it?") and question two ("Any thoughts?"), doesn't it?No, it's breaking the license agreement. There is no law in the US or any other country that I'm aware of that says it is illegal to install Mac OS X in a Virtual Machine. Saying it is "breaking the law" is absolutely ludicrous.  As for answering his question one: it IS possible to install OS X in VMWare, the only thing preventing him is his older hardware. It's not blocked, just unsupported. You certainly did answer the "Any thoughts" question, apparently with "not many".that is certainly strange... glad you figured it out and posted the answer so others won't have to get frustrated if they encounter this issue :PArgh... those angry old men :)I guess, if 32 is old to you... or are you referring to Steve Jobs and his angry license agreement? :)Yeah, they did. Version 2.0 includes e.g. proper [iPad support](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1286/great-ipad-apps/2818#2818) which is really neat.Wonderful. thanks!@Phillip Reagan: thanks. You should make that an answer instead of a comment so I can accept it.Chose this answer because I tried the iMovie route and it didn't work.Good answer but it would've been more helpful to add direct links to a couple of good vendors. (Oh, and if you want to make this even more attractive and earn plently of upvotes, *include example pics*.)I think VirtualBox requires hardware virtualization support for OS X as well.Good tip. I would have thought the repair depot would be smart enough to figure that out. I'm going to make the trip to the Genius Bar this weekend instead of using the local repair shop.Good question. It's annoying to have new iPhone-only apps I've purchased appear in iPad too.I also thought that, if the machine didn't Chime, it beeps a number of beeps to indicate the issue? Either one, two or three tones depending on the issue? I'm assuming this isn't happening either. Sometimes it might not chime simply because you had the machine muted when you shut it down. Then the chime respects the volume level you set, so it may not be 100% clear-cut.when you go to http://www.whatismyip.com/ what's show for your Ip?my ip id 93.110.141.3, i can't understand why i can't access filtered sites.Mahdi 93.110.141.3 is IP's of Iran/Tehran this show that you don't connect through VPN. do you sure that you set pp2p pr l2tp right? when you connect vpn is it show in your top toolbar? can you explain what step exactly you did.yes, That ip is for tehran. i disconnected from vpn and reconnected.it works now, why this is so. now my ip is 216.131.120.160, it belongs to us.I seem to remember the beeps coming from fatal errors in OS 9, but I'm not certain that I remember that one correctly.I don't know what exactly you did, but when you change vpn configuration you need to reconnect airport and connect via VPN. if your problem was solved then delete your question because this question don't have a specific answer.Do you still have the problem if you put back the original hard drive?Interesting; I didn't know about option 2. It doesn't work for me though: the app eventually closes, yes, in the sense that you return to home screen, but it still stays in the background.Interestingly, the second option does close an app, but does not remove it from the app switcher. You can confirm this by, for example, drilling down a few levels  in the Settings app. After closing the app using the second method, and then reopening it, you will find yourself back at the main Settings screen; i.e. the "state" of the Settings app has been lost. The second method of quitting an app is mentioned in the iPhone documentation and can even be used on iPhones that do not support multitasking, to quit, for example, an iPod app that is not responding.Ah, thanks for the explanation! Perhaps this should be mentioned in the other, non-closed question too... (Or maybe @Dori could merge this into that question?)Fore sure it is a feature as it is explained in the manual exactly like you write it above.These are existing voicemail messages.The command-line version `vim` is already available in Terminal.app.True, but since he talked about BBEdit and Textmate, I assumed he wanted graphical application and not in command-line.+1 it rocks :) Top effort for a single developer!Oh wait a minute, nevermind, I just had it plugged into the USB hub, you don't need iTunes or anything... :-p

Still for $300 the least Jobs could do is give me a longer USB cable.Duplicate of [Monodevelop on OS X and Displaying UTF-8](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4009728/monodevelop-on-os-x-and-displaying-utf-8) on Stack Overflow.This time I changed it slightly, and made the question for any app, and for any device.Apple makes stuff that works with Windows, you know. Some stuff also works under Linux. Still apple, just no OS X.Could you explain why you don't want TuneUP or MusicBrainz? How about why you can't use Tunatic?Yes, i added it there but forgot to put it here, thanks, as i'm not sure on the best way to ask questions.I have MBP 13' dual core 13", but I don't get my answer. I want know it hurts battery lifetime (or adapter lifetime) when always plug adapter although battery was fully chargedthis app you suggest don't useful for me, I want 3rd-party software to install on my mac not on my mobile.@ben if I want to answer simply because work with software like Tunatic is very easier than work with software like musicBrainz and ... .Sorry I wasn't sure if a smartphone app would work for you or not.if it's only a few songs that are unknown could you just use MusicBrainz for those and TuneUp or something else for the rest?You might have to accept the fact that there is no such application @Am1rr3zA+1 for actually putting it to the test!It's simple: If it is a unibody Mac, you get better battery performance. If you don't, you have to manage the battery yourself.@Ivo I myself find Tunatic that do what I meant exactly but it has problem on my notebood so I want equivalent of TunaticI must admit, this is a bit surprising. Isn't the use of the power button dangerous? Again, on Linux it's usually the wost thing you can do, resulting eventually in a corrupted file system. Thanks!I've never had a problem with the file system upon killing the power to a Mac ever. I've had open files get corrupted, but I save early and often, so it's been a long, long time since that has last happened.there's a dup of this on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/952886/editing-large-files-on-mac-os-xRecent versions of OS X use file system journalling by default, which means the file system can almost always heal itself after a crash.  Mind you, this does nothing to protect the contents of open files...Actually, I'm sorry, it wasn't a Textmate screencast, it was the "Ruby on Rails 15 Minute Blog" screencast. 
It's this program, no doubt! Thanks a lot, I had searched this before to no avail.I bought a new MacBookPro last thursday, and I already had a system freeze three times. Two of them while copying data from an external hard disk and one after a system update.. not a very lucky start :( But you are right Gordon: with journaling a file system should be able to rewind to the last working state.After downvoting an answer, it's considered polite to say why in a comment./agree "How do I reformat my restore DVDs so I can save what I want on them?" -- Are you crazy?I don't have a macbook air, but I do have the cool little usb stick. I want to use it for other files. I realize that it's hard to format it (I tried), but I want to know how.what about the option to erase? is that there?  I also remember reading about a command for putting a disk back into it's "factory" state, meaning you'd have to "initialize" the disk again.  I can't remember what it was called, but maybe "de-initialize disk mac os x" might be some keywords to start with.@calavera - if it's read-only (see my answer below), there is no option to erase.Do you mean that Automator recognizes a sound that is coming from a microphone?I wonder why you've accepted this answer. You don't get your information from this one... I really also want to know if an "always-fully-charged" battery will have his life shortened. IOW, I wonder if, in case of a long plugged period of time, we'd better extract the battery...@Dan, I *don't* want to connect to Apple computer.@Ngu: then connect to a Windows computer and use iTunes, or be happy with the OS version you're running. Those are your options.@Dan, in fact I want the software upgraded without connecting to any physical machine.+1 on simplenote, this replaced using the built in notes for me. There is also a dashboard widget, and a great app called Notational Velocity will sync to give you even more power.If you read the question carefully, you'll notice I already mention that widget in the first paragraph. As you say, it's about To-do's, **not** Notes.It would have taken forever to find this. I just realized before I posed this question that if you go to the bottom of the screen, the photos in the set will show up.thank you for the picture. I know I had moved my mouse to the top but maybe I didn't. Is there a way to pin the toolbar to the top, similar to how you can pin the inspector/adjustments to the side?@Ngu: That simply isn't possible. You are *required* to physically connect to update the OS.I hadn't heard of Phanfare.  How is it different from Flickr or SmugMug?  Does it (or SmugMug) allow editing photos on an iPad?  Flickr uses Picnik for editing photos, which uses Flash (so it won't work on an iPad).You do not need to connect to the computer to update your apps, though, since they can be updated from the iPhone AppStore. Large apps can be updated as long as you're on WiFi. But no, no way to update the iOS itself.I agree. If you don't use the Mail application anyway, why bother using the built-in note app on the iPhone? A combination of Simplenote and its dashboard widget or Notational Velocity will do exactly what you want, and give you more flexibility and power.thank you. The same control I am already using for the adjustments window.Not even Objective C, that will require a very decent knowledge of C and low level sound analysis algorithms. My head hurts and I only imagined it.(That SO question should probably be moved to Super User or here :)Downvoted for truth. Nice.Given that TextWrangler is BBEdit's little brother, I'd guess that someone who is already using BBEdit won't find anything new there.Note that that will not charge an iPad (there aren't many that do).I reviewed a previous version of BBEdit for *Macworld*, and was sorely disappointed that I wasn't allowed to put "No actual ponies" under the Cons section.You need to better define "is there a better way". For me, not much (computer-wise) is better than a terminal. If you want an app, just wrap the terminal command in an automator or applescript app.@mankoff, good point! But this isn't an Arch Linux forum, so let's assume I want a GUI/built-in solution :). But, you're right, I can just write a shell script.Here is the link to the script solution (I saw it before posting, but it's from 2005, so I assumed that by now this simple feature must have been incorporated into the GUI).  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=118545there is no built-in gui solution that i know of...OK, thanks, All! When I write a good script, I'll post it back here.Here is an interesting link : http://forum.notebookreview.com/hardware-components-aftermarket-upgrades/91846-notebook-battery-guide.htmlWow! That worked. Weird stuff happened - it spontaneously rebooted again, and then a black screen came up with a broken apple or something, but I was able to get in after a little while, and now Gravity HD works! Thanks.Follow up question - is this rebooting procedure something that should be done regularly, like once a month or so?@Martin: It said "without connecting it to a computer and iTunes". My answer is "You can connect it to a computer and use Xcode if you want, but you do have to connect it with a computer."Have you tried other apps?  iBooks or Good Reader display pdfs.Not yet - I didn't want to keep buying apps if they don't work. Are those free?Subjective. Should be made community wiki.iBooks is free, Good Reader is inexpensive, Stanza also displays PDFs and is free, I think.hmm...I have a label in my gmail account that Reads "Notes", but I have not notes, even after syncing.  Is there something else that I have to do?Thanks.. my only problem with that is they look so ugly :) You know.. I'm Apple user, I'm a design maniac@Martin - You wouldn't be the first to say so. ;)You're adding photos to a folder in iTunes? Are you adding them to iPhoto, then *selecting* them in iTunes?great question...I'm looking for a solution which doesn't use screen sharing (or something similar). I want an interface that is optimized for an iPhone and doesn't require me to login to another PC.I changed the tag from `[notes]` to `[notes.app]` as (imo) there are just too many things called "Notes" that shouldn't all share one tag.@balexandre, I'm specifically looking for something that works with the iPhone. According to the page you referred to, this only "Works with Nike+ SportBand and 5th generation iPod nano" -- not iPhone, and not iPod Touch -- only nano. Can you point me to a page that specifically states that this thing works on iPhone 4?Excellent - this is what I was looking for. Agree, it's not cheap, but as long as it's standards-based, it can be used with other software as well. Does the Nike stuff use this standard, or their own?It's hardly "even better" way if you don't want to use Mac OS X in the first place. Virtualization has its places and I also use virtualbox which is great, but sometimes you simply need to run the other OS natively.you probably don't see the notes since they were created on the phone (and stayed that way), rather than getting marked being associated with the gmail account. This happens in many other apps as well, including contacts.Senseful, can you clarify one thing? I'd like to know if you're trying to browse files on shared drives/folders on another machine on your network. Far Finder (one of the answers below) seems to be directed at browsing local files on one machine, not on network shares.well, yeah I get the 'Software Update Tool' info, but it freezes after that. I believe I tried the `man softwareupdate` but I don't remember what happened lol. I definitely didn't try with verbose output. I'll try that later. Thanks!Journalling doesn't work by rewinding, it actually does more the opposite: it completes whatever file operations were in process when the computer crashed.That Export Library is exactly what I needed. I was actually in the process of deleting everything from my iTunes Library and had only these playlists that I wanted to export, so the resulting `xml` file only had the playlist information and worked brilliantly. Thanks!I have read (on Apple's support forum or MacOSXHints or somewhere else) that this will work.  But, that's pretty poor!  I'm hoping to hear that someone else has managed it some other way.Sorry, I don't really understand what you want it to do. Why would you hold it to your ear while dialing, and what does that have to do with vibrating on answering a call?@deceze English foreign speakers ;)You like Opera huh? ;)I don't think both your user accounts being user123@domain.com is your problem.  I'm in the exact same scenario (both work and personal email accounts are IMAP, and both are the same username @ their respective domains), and it works great.  That error message you quoted makes me wonder if you accidentally entered the wrong address for your work email.@Ben: I'm talking about being able to access shared files/folders on your network. For example, it should provide the same functionality as Network Neighborhood on Windows. Or the Shared category in Finder on a Mac. Thus, if Far Finder only allows you to view files on one PC, this is not what I'm looking for.I'm not sure how you would be able to look at a any PC's files without having to log into it first.I updated the specs, so you might want to update your answer.That's the only answer to this one I have. Sorry.Well, think about a computer that accesses another computer's files across the network (e.g. via Finder or Explorer). If those files are shared, it won't ask for a username/password. I do this all the time. It stands to reason that an iPhone should be able to do the same thing.@Mar, @dec: I think the confusion is with the word "dialing" which usually means pressing the numbers on a phone to place a call. I think a better word is "ringing" in this case. Additionally, it would help if it said that the "call answer" is referring to the other person answering the call, not you. The way I first understood it, I thought it was a weird request to have the phone vibrate every time I press "answer" to pick up a call.Neither of them have a pkg removal option that I can find...I disagree. After much digging I found this package installed a service and a launchagent. The service was eating CPU and memory at login. I had to manually remove them.I have the same problems. My iPhone behaves like this since the first day.Tx. Helps prevention. Though a remedy would be nice.I don't. IT security at my company and at home requires logging in; we only have to log in once a day or when disconnected, but we still have to log in. The Public folders on the Macs only show the Drop Box, and that's only one-way.Have you tried putting in a fresh battery?It's kind of hard to use a magnifier to see if the pins are aligned because I cannot really see it in the first place though. Any other possible things to do to see if the slot if dead?o.0 Wow! Nice setup. How did you manage to use iTunes to manage your music while it's on Jungledisk?@Warren:  I think the trick is that both my accounts are backed by Gmail in the end, so the incoming mail server for each is imap.gmail.com.  Is *that* the same situation for you?   If so, let me know and I'll work out a way to send you screenshots so you can tell me what I'm doing wrong.Yes, that's where I discovered this feature :)But often I am in my browser anyway, and want to open, say, amazon in a new tab, not a new window. Otherwise, good suggestion!+1 Cinch. Almost as good as Windows 7.I don't want to jailbreak my phone. Thanks for the info though. By the way, what do AFP and SMB stand for?Thanks for the updates to the problem. Deleted earlier answer since it wouldn't match at all, and included a new one.AFP = Apple Filing Protocol , and SMB  = Server Message Block. AFP is basically the network file sharing built into the Mac OS, while SMB is the similar thing on Windows. The way you see these shares on other machines is done through these protocols. Ive never seen a client similar to this in the App Store.This does exactly what I want. The only issue is that you have to enter in each computer's address (e.g. IP address, or its name) before you can connect to it. I like how Explorer and Finder show you which computers are available to connect to.Awesome. Thanks!Ok, I'm going to try it out right now!Have you tried a little bit of compressed air to make sure there isn't a dust bunny sitting in the headphone jack?yeah - did that.  Even did the cotton swab with a little rubbing alcohol and spun it around in there.  Nothing.Have you tried another pair of headphones with the iPod?shift + option cannot be used.I'm on 4.2 beta 3 and the setting also doesn't exist.+1 Cinch, though it's awkward on multiple monitor setups.Oh so the Apple site is not the place to ask about an iPhone? Anyway it doesn't matter I got a new iPhone. But there 3 up votes on the question which suggest others also want to know.I'm not saying that this SE site isn't the place to ask this question; it's about an Apple product so, technically, it's appropriate. I'm just saying that you'll probably have better luck actually getting an answer about iPhone hacking elsewhere, like in a forum dedicated to iPhone hacking. I know it's not a real answer to your question, but hard hacking questions like this don't get answered much here.@mar: I think one of the reasons is that many people prefer the landscape keyboard, which I can't stand. Btw, do you happen to have a link to one of the videos you mentioned? I'd be curious to see if I can spot the bug happening on it. I tried searching for it myself, but on one of the videos where a guy claims to be typing "very fast", he's typing maybe 30% of the speed that I'm talking about.I just tested the speed on mobiletypingtest.com so I can get a rough estimate of the speed I'm talking about, and it's coming up in the range of 67-76 wpm.This guy for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNcTE5WJGdw&feature=related (tho you can type iPhone Fast Type in youtube) ;)My iphone was bought last weekend, not in september.You just got lucky :)I did this, but after selecting "Application does not work as expected" and typing in my explanation, including request for refund, I got a message that I need to ask the developer for support and the developer's web page opened in Safari.  I guess I won't be getting a refund.@Daryl Unless the developer deliberately mislead you, it's highly unlikely that you'll get a refund from Apple. Sorry.Ah, good point.  No, only my personal account is backed by Google.I believe this is the right answer. Did you get it working, @leeand00? Btw, related useful screenshots in [this blog post](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/06/save-iphone-notes-to-gmail-account.html).possible duplicate of [How to use my iPod Touch (2d generation) as an hard-drive ?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2267/how-to-use-my-ipod-touch-2d-generation-as-an-hard-drive)+1 for cleverness.Recoverability depends entirely on where the file was located on the hard drive and where data has been written since the file was deleted. Three days is a long time.before firefox4 i had moved almost completely to chrome, but yay for ff4 (esp. tab grouping)Bizarrely I could watch it be going to the file currently being downloaded in Finder. Just not through iTunes. But I think in iTunes 10 it adds the file your downloading to your library when you click download, not when it's finished, so you can watch it from your library, however it got mixed and put the video in Movies instead of iTunes U.@khedron: it's useful for long-running unattended tasks e.g. download program, compiler, video encoding, some long computation, ... anything that doesn't require interaction but takes long enough time that your Mac would sleep otherwise.Really great tool!@Jonik: it's not about simple rename, but mass rename of many files :-) On Windows I use built-in tool in Total Commander for this.Thanks for sharing the link to iVox. At least there is czech voice, I'll try it.@Peter: Of course it's about mass rename; I still find it odd and funny, especially the price tag. (NB: my background is in the Unix world, where powerful command-line has always existed and people generally are adept at it, which might partly explain my reaction :-)What file type is it?So how does it verify whether you've legitimately purchased it?  Should I worry about anything if using another CD?I don't know about that. When I bought Snow Leopard, I did a clean install and no serial number was asked whatsoever.i've been working on writing something like this... there are some libraries available in python and there is a tool called beets that makes use of them so i've been investigating how it's written.in addition... MusicBrainz Picard is written in Python and is open source so there's probably a lot to be gleaned from it's code and library usage as well.thanks, i will check it out. quick question, can i batch modify multiple directories that have about 10K songs :)Yes, that is possible. It even has a feature for live albums or albums where the tracks have no pauses or crossfade. It can analyse the volume for the whole CD (folder) and then lower/raise the volume for each track by the same amount.alt and cmd are the same button, is that correct?other headphones also have the same problemthanks again, I am going to be using this@khedron I got Caffeine so that I could watch videos on my computer without the screen dimming. I had had enough of wiggling the mouse every few minutes.+agreed... the unarchiver works better than the default decompression utility anyway, and Loic is right, the default will not work with .rar files.It doesn't verify. You're used to thinking like other software companies that don't trust their users and make it really difficult. Apple is about experience and a serial number would get in the way. Even the new iWork has no serial number or check on number of installs at all. They just trust you. Besides pirates will still pirate serial numbers just make it hard for legit users.+1 for Simplenote.Yeah I needed to reboot the mac. No crash report has been asked, it just froze. ok for all the rest thanksthe unarchiver it is. Handles lot's of file formats.There is also Jing, but it's not as good.Personally I think Excel is more powerful than Numbers, or at least the power is not hidden.Firefox is sssllllooowww.@Warren  Alas!  I was hoping you'd found the secret to what I was doing wrong.  Thank you for trying, through.Beats MacPorts and Fink right out the water!@Dori An iPod touch does not have a hard drive. It uses flash memory, so this question shouldn't be tagged "hard-drive". Secondly, the question that this question is a duplicate of provides solutions for both Mac and Windows.I'm on Leopard :-/Sorry about the confusion. I called the same key alt and opt in the same answer. I've edited the answer.This sounds very promising.  I was experimenting with my DNS powers to create an imap.company.com as a CNAME for imap.gmail.com.  I don't like the certificate warnings I was getting, though.  So I may try this, we will see ...Yeah I have Billings. But what I actually need is to manage customers subscriptions. I need to send them reminders every 6 months for example. And It would be great if the system informs me when a customer stops to pay me on my bank accountpossible duplicate of [Reinstalling OS - Retrieve Serial number from filesystem](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3596/reinstalling-os-retrieve-serial-number-from-filesystem)I closed this because the OP was asking how to find something that doesn't exist.I don't understand rationale behind "Text boxes and lists only" setting being default.Good point curtismchale.  I wasn't certain about this so thought I'd ask.  Thanks.Thanks for this answer.  I think it's the most thorough explanation here.The file is a Adobe InDesign file: .indd.It is not a perception problem.  From loud to very soft.  Puzzled me also.  My colleague said it could be a "resistance" problem in the wire.For future reference, the hardware serial number is available from the system profiler, About This Mac, on the Hardware Overview page. (I know that doesn't help much without the computer in hand.)  If you've ever made an AppleCare support request, you were probably asked for it - perhaps Apple Support have a record of it.PhotoRec supports .indd.  I suggest you try out my suggestion ASAP or the file will likely become unrecoverable.I tried the demo. It remembers window size and position on the display, but not *which* display. This means I still have to drag each window one by one onto the 2nd monitor. This is also nice, but it doesn't answer my question :(Well thanks, I already use VLC, especially because of that broadband-file-type-support you mention :) But the thing is that Preview (Or Quick Look, I'm a little confused now. Well, the thing that pop up when pressing the spacebar) used to play .avi files properly, but now it's missing. But thanks, I will look into Perian.I think you were talking about Quick Look and not Preview. So I changed your question/answer/tags accordingly.Platform? (I'm assuming Windows.)@Philip: oops forgot to include that... It's on a Mac.I already tried the first option. I'm not sure I want to reinstall since I'm afraid it will delete an old backup of my phone. Would Apple even allow you to uninstall iTunes from a Mac? I always assumed they pulled a Microsoft/IE.I believe that iTunesHelper is exactly the name of the app it wanted me to install. Unfortunately, I don't have it listed in that list (since I opted out of installing it).@Senseful: I updated the answer, check if you can get iTunesHelper added now!(If iTunesHelper.app is missing from within the iTunes.app bundle on your computer, then my best guess is that you'd indeed have to reinstall iTunes.)wow that really sucks... I love the backlights.Yes, quick look is what pops up when you hit space bar. Preview is what 'usually' (as in a default OS install) opens when you open a PDF (by double clicking). I do not exactly remember using Perian with QuickLook, but it all uses the same backend.iTunesHelper.app was there, thanks it works.Oh, I'm sorry. I only use it on 1 monitor, so that use case was never an issue for me. I have contacted the developer before for another feature request, he replied fairly quickly. Maybe you could make a feature request for multimonitor support?I love homebrew. Much better than MacPorts. Uses existing libraries that come with OS X to cut down compile times."wildly popular personal database" - I love marketing folks.This has worked, thank you so much!  I'm directing Ars Technica & Apple Support forums here.  FWIW, it does look like I might have been able to avoid this if initially in the company account creation, I'd (correctly) entered in username123@company.com for the name, instead of just username123 -- I had to make that change eventually for it to work in the first place, but I think maybe the AccountPath setting was set initially by the username value and not updated.  On this second go around, where I knew better what I was doing, the AccountPath contained @companyname.com.haha yeah. Its not a bad app, but it nowhere as great as they think it is :)Thanks; that would be partway there certainly. Is it possible to tell Preview to refresh but not come to the front? How does one figure out what AppleScript hooks are available for an app (or is that a new question I should ask)?@Sev no problem :)@jemus42 Perial will do, since the backend is the same. Perian allows you to see DivX files (for example) using QuickLook (and time)As I edited in my original question, Perian resolved the problem and works just nicely (I know have the ability to preview .mkv files in QuickLook, nice!). As far as the destinction between QuickLook & Preview is concerned, I have to admit that I'm German, and I'm used to call both things "Vorschau" (equivalent zo "Preview"), so, sorry for the confusion.It is partial duplicate, but if there is any way to achieve this in plain Mac OS, I would be 100% happy :)There's a discussion in the apple forums here: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2162220 about this issue, but no solution (yet).Jaydles, you can't upload files from Safari on *any* site. The app-centric suggestions that others made are the only way to go.Here's an article on cnet which also describes the issue, but unfortunately no definite fix: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20015817-263.htmlExactly what I needed, thanks.Are you looking to replace the photo or you just want to know where it is to use it?My wife likes the photo it took of here. She wants a copy to use elsewhere.There is no `~/Library/Images/iChat Recent Pictures` directory. I did find `~/Library/Application\ Support/AddressBook/Images/` but the one file in there isn't an image file.I looked there, too, and didn't find anything. This is an odd one, to be sure. It might an invisible file to hide it from nefarious characters such as ourselves since the system uses it in a variety of places.darn...it appeared to be in there for my current profile picture.  You could try  fs_usage while accessing it and see if that reveals the locationWith the caveat being that the user hasn't cleaned that out (like I do every month), even though my account image remains the same.@Martin, thanks - I got that to working. The one remaining problem is that the window order is twiddled; I'd prefer for it to remain exactly the same.Skim does what I want; thanks. It still likes to bring itself forward during the refresh, but I can work around that. Skim also affords much more effective AppleScripting than Preview (you can tell it to refresh directly).I edited the answer to have 3rdparty's info. I hope that's okay. If not, feel free to revert!Okay, I'll wait until I can afford a Pro then...AppleDisplayScaleFactor http://www.macworld.com/article/142173/2009/08/scaleapps.htmlNope; I also thought that retailers had serial numbers. But we contacted Amazon before I posted this here, and they said that no, they don't keep records of serial numbers, with or without the receipt number or sales date.Is it possible to make this work without disabling music syncing entirely? I do like having "Recently Added" auto-sync.This one's much smoother for just re-opening tabs/windows than the scripts I found (figures, they were old!). +1! But just quitting and re-opening the same tabs again might not be so useful...skipping the first 5 lines would make it a great way to start Safari, though. =)That would require fiddling with the index of each document (document *n*), but typically that's a read-only property.Thx for your answer and the link...+1 on this route. There really isn't a way to do this, and I recently went through this at home. My wife and I keep separate libraries, but do share stuff now through home sharing (where you can copy b/t libraries). You may be able to write some AppleScripts though to update both libraries when something new is added to the file server.This is exactly how we do it at my house, and it doesn't suck. And hey, that drawback can become a neat surprise when you find out what new stuff is on the network drive to add to your library!It's on the cover, the actual LCD is fine, and you don't have to sit on it, it looks like transporting it in a bag is already enough :)In France we have also Deezer, but I already have a subtential iTunes library...

Bear in mind that Home and End do not always behave the same way on OS X as they do on other OSes.+agreed.  There's quite a bit of difference from the windows functionality.  Some apps act like windows with these keys, others don't.I'm not saying it won't work (i have no idea), just that it freaks me out even thinking about using anything even slightly abrasive on my macbook screen :)@calavera How can I define keystroke for home and end to do exactly the same as windows?@am1rr3za: you can't do it in the OS... it's the way the apps themselves are programmed that defines how they handle those keys.

And the answers shed light on the fact that OS X doesn't require a serial number for installation.  Also, how do you know for sure that it doesn't exist?  Someone may come along a month from now and say that they found an encrypted file containing a unique serial number that embeds itself deep in every OS X system :)No..This didn't work for me.

It happens :)+1 this is the right (and possibly only) way.Thanks - I didn't know about the hold-down-home recovery mode. However it sounds like that's a power-on action, and with a broken top button I can't turn it off. That means I'll need to run it flat and hope they're kidding about charge-for-ten-minutes-first bullet in the instructions :-/ I can't get recovery mode to work from the state it's currently in.Already have it. I tried downloading a complete book using web snapper and gave up after doing several chapters. Acrobat allows you to limit the depth as well as keeping all downloads on a single domain or even limiting to a specific prefix (e.g.: http://domain/directory).That works for me.

I do not know what Perian is, or how I would get hold of it, so I suppose the answer to that is no ;)I fixed the question. With the excellent discussion that follows, I believe this is now a very informative question.Also maybe consider re-opening the question?Yeah, you're right. Most of the time it's web-browsing... But one time it won't be! Thanks!OK that worked. Complicated, but it works :)As I understand things (and it wouldn't be the first time I was incorrect, by far!), just because a question is closed does *not* imply that it will be deleted. That is, just because it's closed doesn't mean that the question and its answers will go away. Consequently, I don't see why "informative" is a reason to re-open, as the useful info isn't going anywhere. Given the consensus, though, I've reopened it. I'll be interested to see what gets added to the current responses that adds more value to what's already here.@RHTP glad to hear it worked. Yeah, Smart Playlists tend to be dumb sometimes :)well I did mention that :)@Martin: my bad, I didn't notice that in the last part of your answer.  I think this is all he should worry about though, there should be no reason Apple can come up with that would justify his screen being scratched by the keys...Yep, you were right I meant the Finder's Sidebar. I do have a Time Machine + Time Capsule for the kid's iMac but I thought it may be easier just to reset things than dig through backups.@Dori: there are many reasons why a closed question is worse than an open question (e.g. it's harder to add answers, it gets less attention, it's more likely to be deleted, future changes to the SE system may treat closed questions differently, etc.). Regardless though, the way @sentinel fixed the question makes it *definitely* a valid question, and there's absolutely no reason for it to be closed. Great job on the edit, @sentinel!@Dori: Please forgive me if the last statement came off as rude. It's just that I have experienced the same thing and it can be very annoying to the OP. Just because the OS doesn't have a serial, doesn't mean that there aren't a million people that think it does. This question would greatly benefit those people by educating them on this fact. If the question didn't exist, they might spend countless hours having to figure this out on their own. [cont...][cont...] For this reason, I caution you to be very cautious about closing questions that are 100% clear to you but may be unclear to others. *Especially* when questions are about something that doesn't exist, since that means it will be *that* much harder to find it on Google. The best thing that could be done is to reword the questions exactly as @sentinel did.The iPhone SIM can be used in any unlocked phone, but there are some companies (Tracfone) that lock their SIMs to their hardware.Can you be more specific about what game controller, and what sort of input that controller offers?I've since given up and bought an Airport Express.  It works flawlessly, with no special wifi configuration, which suggests the problem was not with neighborhood interference.Mac OS X Server comes with an FTP server built in.  Is there something specific you're looking for that it doesn't do?I had just ready it was very performant or feature rich in a lot of ways.TGnat your own advice is always a good idea when buying things :)I really don't think signal strength has anything to do with it. I can hold my iPod 6 inches away or on the other side of the building, and still get full bars and full speed right up until the second when it drops out completely.  Also, when my Mac's wifi gets flakey because of weak signal, its failure mode is not "full bars/speed for 2 minutes, no connection at all for 30 sec, full bars/speed for 1 minute, etc".  It's only when acting as a base station that it likes to cut out entirely from time to time.  Signal strength also wouldn't explain why it worked perfectly for 2 weeks.+1 for your answer but I don'thave time now to test it, later I test and tell it solve my problem or not.Yeah, it's a Logitech Dual Action Gamepad, if that helps any (http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Only-Gamepad-Dual-Action/dp/B00171376K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1289119568&sr=1-1).  As far as what input it offers, I am just looking to use it as a standard controller.  I am trying to use it with the Snex9x simulator; with that application, you can choose multiple different input devices, but my controller doesn't show up as an option; I thought maybe I needed to make it active in the MAC controls.  I tried checking for that option under the system preferences, but found no options.  ThanksSorry, that should read Snes9x simulator ^^.  And, really, thanks for your attention.[Quote of the day](https://twitter.com/Tisca/status/29304574565): "I just ditched Firefox for Chrome. I feel like I just left my wife and kids for a 19 year old cheerleader."Wow, very detailed!! I was using WinXP and found the app in the location you suggested. I then copied it into the "Mobile Applications" directory in my current Win7 installation, but I don't see the app in iTunes. What do I still need to do?Nevermind, I found it. I had iTunes running while I copied the file, and couldn't find the app after restarting iTunes. But another iTunes restart seems to have worked; perhaps I was just too impatient. It's installed on my iPhone now -- THANK YOU!Cheers! Oh and standard procedure for importing an app from its file into iTunes would be to open the .ipa file with iTunes, or to select File > Add File to Library and select the .ipa file.Just off the top, two things: (1) deleting the thumbnails and noticing that they load slower means that it's just regenerating them for each photo you view, and (2) you plan to import 280 GB of photos into Aperture on your 320 GB drive? FWIW, I have 4000 photos, my Thumbnails take up 3.3 GB and my Previews (1440 x 1440, quality 11) take up 2.6 GB.I just checked on my iPhone 4 with SYSTEM Lite, and it shows 503 MB. Perhaps [Kyle](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3734/my-iphone-4-only-shows-256-mb-of-ram/3757#3757) is right.There is no ambient light :-) but I will turn off autobrightness and test tonight.Standard procedure? :-) I just right-clicked the file in Windows Explorer and selected `open`. Maybe that's what made the difference before the second restart.Right, that's what I meant with opening it with iTunes :) You can't just copy the file to your current "Mobile Applications" folder as its info must be registered in your iTunes Library data file.When Auto-Brightness is off, then the brightness is always as specified and not more. When Auto-Brightness is on, then it's much brighter but ONLY at the lock screen -- it dims down to ambient level once I slide to unlock. Is this a bug in iOS?Maybe they just built in an A4 for an iPod touch (with only 256 MB of RAM) into my iPhone?That would be funny, but probably the only way to tell would be to physically break apart the A4 chip and see. I think it's more likely that it was just a manufacturing error where one of the 256's wasn't built or connected right, but since the phone still powered on nobody noticed. I wonder how many more iOS devices are out there with half their memory.That is really weird. Please do follow up on this!WOOHOO! I had to hold down the home button for four minutes whilst it charged up and iTunes got its act together, but it's now successfully restored and usable again. Thanks again, much appreciated.On the iPhone 4, it's based off of the phone number, and I want to use my email instead like on the iPod Touch/Mac FaceTime appI seem to recall reading something about creating a Facetime Contact Bookmark, which should be the easy part, but I seem to also remember reading something about a Home Screen Facetime Contact link, which I can't seem to find or put together how to do yet.P.S. I have 4.2 on my iPad and iPhone, so I know also that nothing's changing 4.1 -> 4.2 to make this process easier, which I'm very disappointed to say.That's what I feared. Thanks for the tip about Safari, though. :-)Theme which bits? The menus? Music player? I'd be surprised either way.Another point here: USB ports can run in either low-power or high-power mode and obviously you want the high power mode to charge your device quicker. However your machine won't necessarily switch the port to high-power mode unless it recognises the device, which usually means installing the drivers, which usually means installing iTunes. Some PCs and hubs will run some ports in high-power mode regardless, though, and you'll be able to use these to charge your device without software. But usable third-party wall-socket chargers are pretty cheap too.As I said, all the photos are on a network drive. I have ~20TB (!) of networked storage space, all on a copper gigabit network. I am running the import using the "Store files in their current location" option in the import dialog.Thanks. In my case I wanted to remove the middle one, not add another but good to know for future reference.As a comparison, I'm upgrading from picasa, which manages the whole 675,000+ image collection using only 6.75 GB of local storage space.You might be able to reset your Wi-Fi connection via locking/unlocking your iPod, that's how [I got it working on my iPad](http://www.sensefulsolutions.com/2010/06/ipad-tip-quickly-reconnect-to-wi-fi-via.html).@torben: I noticed the same thing, and it's very annoying that the lock screen is so bright, especially in a dark room. It only started happening in OS 4.x. I'm hoping it's a bug and not a feature...What OS are you running? Did you try to put the iPod in recovery mode?@Korneel: maybe you were observing the temperature after the phone took those measures to cool down. It might be extra cautious when that happens and maybe it waits until it is super cool before getting out of that mode.Wow, you took a long time to take those screenshots ;)@gareth yeah, I wasn't really satisfied with the first 1569 screenshots :)Just so I know when I get my pad next week, does anyone know the Orange settings for 3g?+1 SBSettings is a nice feature!For Orange UK, the APN is `orangeinternet` and the username and password should be left blank.Oh man... you had a lot of "fun" asking this question.

But have you any "official" prooflink?How does Apple prevent people from doing this to share their purchases (piracy)?Handy to know...One possibility: my Mom's still using Tiger, so maybe that's something that changed in Leopard or Snow Leopard. It is true that when I enabled the sharing over WiFi, OS X showed a warning that I might be violating the terms of service of my ISP. Sounds like the ISPs have successfully lobbied Apple to remove the option.sorry, I originally posted this question on SuperUser and didn't receive any answers and came across this stackexchange site and copied the question over.

Even if you choose to authorize a friend's computer, your friend will still need your account name and password every time he/she wants to update the app.The Apple adaptor you linked to is [Mini DisplayPort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_DisplayPort) to VGA, not [DVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface) to VGA -- which one does your MacBook actually have?  (It might also be [Mini-DVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-DVI) or [Micro-DVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-DVI).)Found it, changed it, restarted it, still get the 404.  :-(  I was going to be shocked if this was the case, since the control panel says "Your personal website: http://192.168.15.103/~name/".Also, I'm pretty sure I've used personal web sharing on 10.5 here before, and /private/var/log/apache2/access_log shows a few successful (200) hits to files under ~/name/ in 2008.@Ken Are you using your full username? The "/~username/" in the URL is your "short" username. If that's not it I'm not sure what's wrong.could it be a permissions error?  I think it's a different error code for permissions errors but make your index.html permissions are at least 644It's the 'short' name (Unix login name, same as the control panel says to use, same as the access logs said I used in 2008).  My index.html is already 644 (that's rw/r/r, IIRC).@Gordon Davisson Mini-DVI sorryWorking well in my scripting, thank you!@Kyle I have found one here: http://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/3261/owc_mercury_extreme_sandforce_sf_1200_100gb_ssd/index8.htmlSince Patrick clarified that he has Mini-DVI output, [this](http://store.apple.com/us/product/M9319G/A) is the appropriate adapter.  Also, note that this doesn't carry audio, you need a separate cable for that.In that case, see my comment on Martin's answer.  I should mention that the VGA-RCA adapter cable you linked to will NOT work at all -- it has the right connectors, but puts completely TV-incompatible signals on them.try 777 just as a test. if works you know it was permissions.  not likely, but worth a try :)Makes a good explanation :)If he's worried about the cost and downtime, why not switch the hard drive out himself?

These keyboard shortcuts seem to dump the screenshots on my desktop which is OK, but is there a way to copy them directly to my clipboard instead, sort of like the "PrntScr" key in Windows?@Airplane I edited my answer you can use control for that job.Thanks, but is there a 3rd party app that does this?I use MagicPrefs. It's not *quite* as nice as a real middle click, because the mouse seems to get a bit confused sometimes. I think I will try BetterTouchTool and see if it's any better.I was quite pedantic during assembly, though humans are full of error.

There's no mention of any right fan sensor, should there be?I've had this problem recently as well. I think the iPhone 4.0 changed the way it stores photos on disk, and it seems to be incompatible with iPhoto 9.The answer is, I don't exactly know. I'm just reading a book and the author thinks it useful that I know this stuff. I agree. I'm reading the book as a whole, not just to find out about how the hardware works. I gave a link to the TOC for that book and I'm after something that would give me the same level of understanding my Intel machine as I would have had had I a PowerPC. I didn't want to copy-paste the TOC itself.Recently played PALYLISTS didn't solve your problem?@Am1rr3zA: not really. The way I imagine it is I open iTunes and see it in the same state as when I last closed it. I want to be able to continue listening the album or maybe the whole playlist. Doing that through the Last Played is a lot of extra clicks: click Last Played, click the top song, right-click, select "Show in such and such play list", and only then "Play". And btw, "last played" doesn't include tracks that you haven't finished listening to.+1 for this. The upgrade isn't really that bad.this is confusing; on one hand you said that complete discharge can cause damage, on the other Apple recommends complete battery discharge. So, whether I should complete discharge my battery once in a while?Apple recommends a complete battery cycle, so why would it recommend something which isn't great for the battery?LOL I always get their acronyms mixed up.  Indeed, I meant the OCZ drives :)what model MBP do you have?With most apps, there's indeed no problem. I've noticed, however, that some apps like **Skype** definitely drain battery way too fast if you leave them on the background.I see Apple's recommendation on the notebook page (http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html), I don't necessarily think it means *complete* discharge/recharge, I think it simply means you shouldn't leave the battery sit in a fully charged or fully discharged state. It should be discharged and charged at least once a month. For longterm storage it should be kept at a 40-50% charge level.if we knew that, maybe someone with a similar model could post their sensor report as well and we could see if there is any difference...  mine is too different to be of any use i think:  http://pastebin.com/UyB6aPQQSpot on. I have seen a recommendation and explanation of discharge damage elsewhere. When the device turns itself off it has detected a minimum safe charge. The only thing that you should do from this point is recharge. If you attempt to turn it on again you risk damage to the battery. The point in the comment by ghoppe about storage is good advice too.It's interesting that powerbook medic only shows one type of superdrive connector regardless of what MBP model you choose.  I have a first gen 2.0GHz machine and I know for sure that it uses a different connector than the one linked, but they are sayng it's compatible with my model... but there's at least 2 different types of connectors.  I'd assume 1 is for SATA (serial-ATA... the one linked by Tim) and one is for the older parallel ata/ide (the one I was referring to above).lol, i know crap about web serving so it was a shot in the dark :Pcan you get to the computer's apache page by going to just the ip address without a user name?also, in the temperature monitor temp readings, does it show readings for both of your cpu cores?@Nathan Have you tried setting the output/input with SoundForce? do you still experience the same issue?I don't think it's a problem with my wireless network as I can't even get to the point to select the network. I've added a screenshot to show what I mean.This is disappointing. I can understand not adding new features, but audio streaming to the old Apple TV *works with iTunes* so I don't know why it shouldn't with iOS. But thanks for confirming that it's a known issue.Wow, that is easy, thanks!thanks for thisI will give it shot. If the resulting files work with iTunes, that would be really great.@Kyle There is no such thing as iOS "Low Memory" warnings, at least nothing a user can see. When an app like Rock Band displays a warning, it means that Rock Band is trying to use too much memory. Any backgrounded apps will be killed if they use enough memory to affect performance.Strange. Have you restarted the iPad? (like full hardware shutdown and startup?)Yes - I tried this, but not luck :(@kubi [orly?](http://modos.org/rockbandlowmem.PNG) The screenshot comes from tapping "Quick Play" after just opening the game. While Rock Band did produce the warning box, it did not cause the memory shortage.I think this would make a great Community Wiki topic.@VxJasonxV Community Wiki is for semi-offtopic posts or posts where a lot of people are editing the answers. Unless we're going to have each key combination posted in a separate answer, I don't see the need for this post to be Community Wiki.Everything you do on an iOS device results in dangerously low memory. What Rock Band *should* be doing is lowering it's own memory usage and letting the OS kill other apps. It certainly should not asking the user to restart their phone. Ugly and uneccissary.Why don't we have each key combination (and their use requirements) in a separate answer?@VxJasonxV It's not necessary to do thatsome people highly prefer the keyboard :PI don't want to use the mic and headphones at the same time, just the mic.@bpapa I think it's necessary, even if you only want to use the mic. Otherwise the connectors won't line up properly@Kyle, that worked- thanks!  (Although it makes me feel a little like the guy who calls support without restarting.)  Care to make it an answer, so I can accept it, and the next person who runs into it will find the right solution?ok, done, glad it worked for you90% of all audio file programs I've ever had are due to encoder/decoder disagreements, that or just one broken encoder.calavera: Any path I try (including nothing at all) gives the same 404.  But if I try, say, the same IP address on a different port, then Safari gives a very different can't-connect error, so it looks like the 404 is indeed coming from my web server (in case that was in doubt).@Ken did you check the permissions of the containing folder (~/username/Sites)? I've occasionally had problems where the permissions on the file were OK but the containing folder were affecting my ability to access the pageIt might be worth noting that there's a 5th type of memory if you click "Inspect" on a process compared with the columns in Activity monitor. Specifically, there's two types of "Virtual" memory: "Virtual Memory Size" and "Virtual Private Memory". The latter is what is shown in the "Virtual Mem" column in Activity Monitor.From reading Apple's Managing Memory doc, **Inactive** hasn't necessarily been cached to disk. You can demonstrate this if you check your Inactive memory usage (mine is 747.5 MB right now) and your "Swap used" (mine is 0 bytes right now). Inactive just refers to memory pages that haven't been recently read/written by any process.It might be worth clarifying "Virtual" since there are two references to "Virtual" memory in Activity Monitor. The "Virtual Mem" column refers to "*Virtual Private Memory*" in the Inspect Process window, and then there's another simply titled "*Virtual Memory Size*" entry in that window (which I believe to be the *shared* component of the Virtual memory). This is on 10.6.4 (in case Activity Monitor has changed terminology...)I'd still like an answer from somebody using a Safari extension for this.This is not my experience using Google Mail via Exchange to allow push. What type of account/server are you using? This might be specific to the email service you're using...?@NguSoonHui: where are you getting that info from? Standard practice with Lithium-based batteries is to *occasionally* (say once every month or two) do a full cycle to recalibrate the battery capacity, but otherwise *avoid discharging often*. Lithium batteries degraded faster when fully discharged often and when they're hot. Optimal conditions are 40% charge and (I think) around room temperature or a little below, but of course its infeasible to maintain either of these in a phone!While I don't use one, I can see that having a virus scanner on your mac would at least ensure you don't accidentally pass infected documents on to friends/family/coworkers who might run Windows without a virus scanner :oAh, oh well. This is actually an archive of predominantly web-sourced content, which explains the small image size. I have two predominant workflows, and this is the one that continually causes problems (Every piece of software I have ever tried has problems with a 600k image library). Dealing with RAW images is actually easier, because I have many fewer of them.Hmmm. Is it possible to configure where aperture stores the .aplibrary? I don't see why I can't move the whole thing onto my NAS. It might even be faster (RAID5 FTW).Is [this one](http://cgi.ebay.com.au/MACBOOK-A1181-OPTICAL-DRIVE-CABLE-APPLE-821-0408-A-/130446044367?pt=AU_Computers_Apple_Parts_Accessories&hash=item1e5f30accf) any good? It says that it is a connector for an A1181 optical driveSame here, Google Mail via Exchange to allow push. I get read and unread messages pushed to the phone. (iPhone 3GS)Sorry, I didn't make myself clear, I've clarified my question.Did you figure out the cause?+1, this is what my response was, but without the pictures and better explanation.Do you really need AFP, or would fixing SMB work for you?Also, these apps aren't always 'still running', they just have their states saved in memory.Yes the resulting files will work with iTunes as long as you choose the compress option. If you choose the Rip option RitIt will create an uncompressed file that can be played by the DVD Player App or a Video_TS Folder that can be played via VLC.Apologies, the songs on itunes are working as expected, showing the correct length and playing normallyIm running windows 7 premiumi believe iOS does restore your icon locations now.  when i upgraded from 3GS to 4 everything was back in the same spot and all photos, texts, and notes were restored as well.@richzilla If the songs are ok in your iTunes, then reset your iPod and try importing the tracks again. If that fails, you might want to check how were your files imported and (possibly) convert them to mp4 within iTunes.But, I don't want to remap them to do something else. I want to know how the OS is aware of what application to control using the same KeySyms every time.You can't in 4.0. You can in 4.1 (barely meaningfully). You can in 4.2.At least with telcel I can't find where to activate itso you don't want to read the code then?can you filter at the level of your router?pushing aside Drarok's real issue (which is that samba is acting flaky), I think this is a very good question (is there an afp server for windows).  so i think we should should try to answer it as stated unless Drarok wants to solve the samba issues, in which case this should be split into 2 questions.also, you may have a better chance with this question on unix.se, superuser, or serverfault.  It's not really apple specific so I'd actually propose that this is an off-topic/outside-scope question.  However, close voting is disabled due to the open bounty.This is as much as I gathered from the article on cnet and the forum post I linked; a workaround is to kill the Dock process one way or another, but nobody seems to know how to completely get rid of this issue - if it's even possible. Is there no solution?@calavera While I agree he might have better luck getting an answer on some of those sites and that there's nothing Apple *specific* about this question, the programs he mentions (with the exception of lynx) do ship with a Mac so it's not strictly off topic.Note that commands may be different in Linux/Unix.  OSX is a bit different in this area.@Kyle: true enough, I mostly was worried about whether he'd get a good answer on here or not.  please see: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/176/if-when-the-site-leaves-beta-will-there-be-an-option-to-migrate-questionsoh, sorry, you're right :/ I didn't realise this was part of the HP driver for the printers here at work... you could still play around with the page order and 2 pages per sheet / double sided printing I guess...sorry i was confused. Please don't do minuus!The Menus or music playerthat won't work on mineI did a restore yesterday, and it didn't restore my item locations, except for the built-in apps. It synced the correct apps and their data back to the device, but I had to manually rearrange them again.Thanks for the tip. Is there a solution that would also capture my touches somehow+1 I really surprise when test your answer.No, this is still a complete mystery. I've seen no indication of cause or resolution. It just happens sometimes... And fixes itself again a while later.I'm wondering what it is that you call vacation mode? Do you mean flight mode, where all the antennas are switched off? In that case the phone can't send or receive new messages but it is (or should be!) still able to display messages that are already on the phone.oh, why is that?The physical hardware is the imac to an Asus GX-D1081 gigabit switch to the server which has an Asus P5N-MX Moto, Pentium dual core E2180 CPU, 2GB DDR2 RAM, Netgear GA311 Gigabit Ethernet PCI Adapter.  I'm using new CAT6 ethernet cables.  The cable to the server is 50ft.  That's the longest one.  The pings range from approx. 0.05ms to 0.60ms, averaging in the 0.2's & 0.3's, so I don't think that's a problem, is it?  I'll try creating an alternate iTunes media folder on a Windows and see what happens, good idea.  I've heard about compiling my own version of Samba, I'll have to check into thatConcerning iTunes: I first noticed this problem when I upgraded to iTunes 10 from 9.2.1.  It might have been there previously and I just didn't notice it, but I don't think so.  My first action was to roll it back to 9.2.1, but the problem still persisted, so I went back to 10.  Though, I do have an external FW drive with OS 10.4 and an older iTunes, I'll boot that up and see what happens.  Thanks for the very helpful feedback!Nice, thanks! Seems like I'm a bit blind..Oh, and the unRAID is based on a SLACKWARE Linux system.  I don't know much about it.I wasn't aware that Cocoa/Mac apps were packages, so that was kind of a tangent.  However, I did read somewhere that other file systems don't know what to do with these packages because they appear to be one file and that can confuse things.  I also didn't understand what the meaning of custom permissions were, so thanks for clearing that up.  I think you're definitely onto something about the metadata problem being the real problem and not the importing.  The file system on the unRAID server is reiserfs.  I don't know much about it except it's a journaled file system.  Great feedback, thanks.Calavera, The model: MacBook Pro 15" Core 2 Duo A1260 (early 2008) - In Temperature Monitor, variable reading are show for all the sensors here: http://www.pastedump.com/paste/1107 Thanks.thanks Ryan, it is not a physical damage so hopefully it should be fine. What do you mean when you say that " in some cases a Genius will cover items under warranty even a few days after it has expired" ? thanksthanks Martin, I am actually in Europe (Ireland). Would that mean that the warranty is 2 years? I believe that when I checked on the apple website it was just one year. Would the second year be provided by the shop I bought it from or by apple directly?[Articles](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/706/iphone-apps-you-cant-live-without/1553#1553) is probably slightly better, but out of the free Wikipedia apps, yes, Wikipanion is the best.You can alter the place that screenshots get saved using some of the populate hidden-tweaks apps like 'secrets', or use the Terminal to execute this command: `defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -path <full path to the location>`, e.g. /Users/YourName/ScreenshotsA lot of these answers are documented: http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/Nope, all cool. ThanksWhere is this? Is this a plug-in or extension?is iTunes in Italian? The menu and user interface outside of the App Store?It's 3rd-party app you can install it and use it in system preferencesTo think that it would be in another web browser! First slightly illogical preference I've seen from Apple. Thanks!@mankoff: partly.. The buttons are, but things like "Loading" is still in english. Same for the app store.If a product is out of warranty by a few days the Genius has the ability to still replace it under warranty for customer appeasement.What language is the menu bar in?@mankoff: almost all in italian, except the "more" button which is in english.Answer still not clear. What "more" button? I am referring to the menu at the very top of the screen, not the top menu in iTunes. Anyway, if the very top menu is Italian, try this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/245/is-it-possible-to-launch-a-program-in-a-specific-language@mankoff: maybe it wasn't very clear, but this is happening on my iPhone (the question is tagged `iphone`). This is a screenshot: http://img177.imageshack.us/img177/7595/img00161.pngCan someone with Tim' MBP model run a temperature monitor and post their version of the report?Resetting the network settings fixed it for me... even though nothing changed. Very strange!If you go with your Mobile Safari (in the iPad) to the URL: ezpcltd.com do you get a response? (I do get one here)Have you tried creating a new blank user to see if the user exhibits the same behavior?@Martin Marconcini - Yes, no problem what so ever - I also have tried with an Iphone and Ipod touch, no problems what so ever, however this has now been solved after a hell of a lot of trouble and almost an entire days work... I will post how I did it when I have a bit of time to write it up.This doesn't work. "Your account is only valid for the Italian iTunes Store. Clicking OK will redirect you there." (this text was in italian). After this I have no choice but to click ok.Although it seems quicker just to type .com than wait for the hover selector to appear.Or just hold your finger on the image until a save and copy button appears.Another reason why the contacts app is a waste of space.my file already has a m4v extension. thanks for the link though -- gives me hope.Okay, so sounds like network isn't the issue... could be that the iTunes samba client was changed slightly around the same time as you upgraded to iTunes 10? This is a total guess though, but perhaps check what other updates you installed at about the same time?This is also the case for the iPhone 2G, 3G and 3Gs.Actually this might just be a limitation of Preview rather than PDFkit...@calavera, I am using an Airport Express router.We learn something new every day. Thank you :)i tried again with the gui version of HandBrake and it worked...iPhone 2G, 3G, 3GS are **almost** the same: on those, the speaker is left and the mic is right.I'd love to figure out the samba issue, but I don't get enough hands-on time with the Mac, as a combination of being very busy (and grumpy when it happens) means my boss has taken to rebooting the Mac when the problem starts. The reboot normally stalls at the blue screen with an activity spinner, so holding the power button down has become a regular occurrence!Thanks for the detailed answer, but I have already tried this, the connection never completes. :(i had read an article here http://www.gadgetvenue.com/android-lock-iphone-01295947/So there is **no way** to change the language to English unless I have an american credit card? Was Daffy Duck their lead programmer? Why do they tie your language to the country you reside in... It's a really stupid assumption.It is not only about the language. There are apps that are only available in certain country specific stores (i.e. US only). And of course there is also the issue of taxes. So it is more a legal requirement than a 'stupid assumption'.Superb! It worked! I needed to make a couple of changes, but yes! You are superb - Thank you!!! Yeah I changed the location to the Dropbox and I also changed Macintosh HD to Main HD and it was all good.No, it really is a Daffy Duck issue: Apple hasn't learned to separate content from presentation. Example: I'm in Austria and if I use my Austrian credit card then the iPhone App Store is in German - but the rest of my iPhone is in English! I can't have the app in English while using a German CC.Figured this was the case. Thanks for clearing this up.I've been continually searching on this for the past few days and I have found nothing to indicate it can be done. So, I'm gonna accept this as the best way to do it. Thanks@Sulcalibur Thanks, it was my pleasure to help - wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it would be fun...=)The Cydia version of AndroidLock does not work on iOS4, AFAIK.Incidentally, if there was a way (through a hidden configuration setting) it would most likely be present in `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist`; but there are no keys in there for setting the screen dimming delay, so I'm inclined to say it's not possible, too.I have Snow Leopard installed on such a machine, so it can be done, but I have upgraded the RAM.  Mine only shipped with 512 MB, which is below the requirement.  They can go up to 2 GB.So, I don't see the GUID and reformat option. I've found this: http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1600 They suggest to create 1 partition to erase the content of the hard drive. But the Apply button is enabled only when I decide to create 2 partitions. (Also the Options.. button is always disabled).Are you booted from the Install DVD when you try this?  If you're booted from the HD, you won't be able to reformat it because it's in use.  Also, use Disk Utility to get info on the drive first, and see what partition scheme is in use -- if it's already GPT (aka GUID Partition Table) you don't need to do this.I second this. I use Handbrake for all my DVD ripping and media conversion.When you put the Mini DisplayPort adapter in the the Display port does the screen flicker?@MHrappstead - No, the display never acts as if it is connected at all.By far the best solution.  More information:  http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1212374This is probably more of a comment than an answer.Wouldn't be surprised if the response you get from Apple is that the touchscreen isn't designed for 70wpm typing.Martin, from what I've found out, you're right.  I never could get the metadata to update at a decent speed.  So now I'm storing my iTunes & iPhoto on the external drive that I was using as the backup and using the unRAID as the backup.  Probably should have done that in the first place.Drfrog, I gave up trying to make it work.  I'm using the unRAID now, just as a backup and using my old backup as the main media drive.  That's a USB ext. drive and has no problems.  THANKS for the help!So "Always open with" only applies to one file?@Casebash, Yes if you "Always open with" it just work for the specific file(s).@Gordon Davisson Yeah, it is GUID Partition Table. Then I guess I don't need to do this. And yes, I rebooted with hard disk as boot device. And I got: "You cannot install Mac OS X on this volume..."Yes, it is shipped with another mac. Oh that's why then...i agree, Picard is just brilliantWhile certainly useful in its own right, I don't think this does what the OP wanted it to do. This workflow will move files created in the last day, but from what I understand of the tickler file system you place files in folders for the day you're supposed to deal with them. If not dealt with on that day, they should be moved to the current day to prevent them being forgotten. So, the files to move could have been created at any time, really.Thanks! This fully answers my question.

There was only source package available, but installing from that (on a Mac with developer tools) was pretty smooth: the standard Unix fare of `configure`, `make` and `make install`. id3lib consists of 4 separate binaries: id3info (for reading tags), id3tag (for writing tags), id3convert, and id3cp. Everything works fine (and iTunes honours the v2 tags written with id3tag).I'm sorry, but **this doesn't work**, now that I actually tried it. What happens is you get [this error message](http://i.imgur.com/fkf6D.png). You'd have to paste first and then delete, which is much clumsier. (I'd change my +1 to -1 as this is very misleading right now, but the platform has locked the vote. I can't even edit answers here yet, due to low rep.)My reputation is too low to create new tags, but I feel that "android openiboot limera1n" are good tags to add to this, if someone wants to do it.For the record: This has been *theoretically* fixed in 10.6.5.Thanks. What a weird path - /var/folders/iz/izqn2b5MF-iz9oL0CURH1U+++TI/-Tmp-/Jonik - Well, drat. I tried 1-2 and 1-3, and they both worked fine, so I jumped to the conclusion that 1-2-3 would as well. Sounds like the way to go is to script the above in 1-3-2 order.bad news, but thanks for testing.Wow, interesting. I wonder what's the real point of this feature though (probably not pranks)...Inverting the colors helps people with poor eyesight.Awesome, thanks!@faB: Hope it will be useful! =)Thank you for your help!Added an example above.  What you describe makes sense and is simple, but it's not what I'm observing.  Inside a single app, I'm seeing multiple different volume settings, and setting the volume inside one app is changing the volume in another app (but not on the home screen).There's also a shortcut (disabled by default) to switch between the normal and inverted displays, which is pressing the Home button 3 times in a row.make sure you also have VLC installed in your /Applications folder or Handbrake won't be able to rip DVDs.@Jonik what did you use to wrap the library?  Some python you wrote?@calavera: Yeah, I have simple scripts that try to determine track number or name from a filename (such as "Artist - 03 - Track.mp3"), and if found, write it to ID3 tag too.I think I got it working by forcing it using the root user, mdutil -E / Seems obvious but I'm unsure.  I can find ARD agent and all that other stuff now though...Oh, I forgot you can show the apps as list and add columns. It's not the perfect solution, because the list also contains my iPad-only apps and stuff I deleted from my iPhone, but it's a viable solution. Thanks! (I'll wait for others to respond, then I'll accept your answer)That fixed it. Thanks!its the same processor, but its not clocked at 1GHz like the iPad.+1. Also, it actually has more RAM than the iPad too. (512 vs 256)No. Whether I have my TimeMachine connected or disconnected, I'm having the problem.@Martin: Thanks for the suggestion.  A blank user has the same problem.CLI and Python yes, but Perl modules on CPAN... not so much :-) (If you can use those in Python too, I wasn't aware of that. Or did you mean writing Perl instead?) Personally I [got this solved](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3585/good-command-line-id3-tool-for-os-x/3976#3976) already, but maybe this is helpful for others.Did he try the compass? It shows the position alongside the direction (if it can get the position).Not sure what apps he tried. I expect he probably tried the built-in Maps app, which (as Kyle mentions) downloads map tiles from the internet.I do have VLC there, and it didn't seem like a problem caused by  an application being in the wrong place.  Handbrake would rip part of the disc (between "a few hundred KB" and "almost all of it", depending on the disc) and then just stop, 100% of the time.  This problem is in the Handbrake FAQ, and it says something like "if you have a slow machine like a G4, just wait a bit longer, it's *fine*", but I've let it run 24 hours on my Core 2 Duo with no progress, and MacTheRipper finishes in a matter of minutes.@Jonk: would you be willing to share?  I don't have a lot of experience with python so something like that would be great to play around with and extend...No need to rebuild the Spotlight index. Your question "Might you be having a copy of your address book somewhere else?" made me search for any *.abcddb files. Sure enough, I had a copy in another folder. After deleting the Address Book .abcddb copy, everything works fine.I seem to recall that iTunes "works around" this hack and will remove the soft link and replace it with a local directory. Not sure if this is still (or ever) true, but I'd be sure to take a look to make sure things are really happening as you expect they are if you use a link.Dori, That's a good point. I hadn't thought about it until your question but what I want is one monitor with a menubar at the bottom and another monitor where I can put extra applications and windows.-1. It's clearly not 1 GHz (see the benchmarks). Apple has a tradition of underclocking the iPhone's CPU since the very first generation.@calavera: [Here you go](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2896691/stack/id3/id3.zip). Usage: `add-track-names.py *mp3` or `add-track-numbers.py *mp3`. Common stuff (most code) is in a separate .py file.

I'm not really a Python coder either, so the code's probably far from "pythonic". :) But I (re)learned a lot when I wrote it, and it's probably easy to extend if your tagging needs are anything like mine.I was under the impression that AirPlane mode turned off *all* antennas/receivers, including the GPS. Found it: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1355It wasn't parental controls or anti-virus.  I disabled the "Allow simultaneous downloads" and now it works fine.I know it's only anecdotal, but I've been *very* impressed by the accuracy of the iPhone 4's GPS. Given clear skies, I'd say the margin of error is less than 10 meters even without the cell tower assistance.You can turn GPS on again afterwards.FWIW, I've never seen iTunes (on an iPod) report that an MP3 of mine was "broken".  It seems perfectly fine.  It just reports an outrageously wrong duration.Yes, it works!!May I suggest you contact the author of the application, maybe he/she can do something about it :)That's useful, thanks.  But there's no way to type the character using the keyboard?@Daryl There is, but it's a little complicated. I've edited my answer to include it.Aren't *most* apps only available in certain countries?  I've tried to install Japanese apps on my American iPod, and been rejected by iTunes as needing an AppleID/iTunes account with a mailing address in Japan for that.Not quite -- they're AppleDouble header files that contain all the interesting additional file attributes that Mac files can have, that other filesystems (and archive formats like tar) don't natively support.  In addition to the resource fork (is there is one), this includes Finder flags, type & creator codes, extended attributes, etc.An excellent answer, you should have referenced this in your other answer.Frankly, I wish I could increase the UI priority further. Unfortunately, renice has a limit of +- 20.Answering the points raised, Spotlights metadata includes last modified time, allowing me to ask "What just changed?"   As for root,  I am root.  It's my system, on my network.  It phones all over the place, not just home. Undocumented in the included help. The "Firewall" only restricts incoming, not outgoing packets, and those outgoing packets are undocumented in the help, as are their destinations. I cross borders with that machine.  My experience tells me that it is wise to know what your tools are doing, and to whom they speak to about your location, and actions.I've typically found that it's the disk i/o, not the cpu load, that causes my system to crawl. Finder and the other applications you mention are probably waiting on reads/writes when they appear to not be responding. I don't really have a solution to this (other than getting a fast disk like an SSD), though, so I'm going to post this as a comment instead of an answer.I knew about networksetup... tricky issue though, networksetup seems to be a command line interface to similar functions to the gui.  I'll have to run opensnoop to be sure, running strings implies that it is a level higher than the "kill switch", that route is.I would have thought so too. However, changing the thread priority *does* affect the UI behavior, which makes me think that either the thread priority also affects IO queue handling, or it is indeed CPU limited.As an example, with the dock priority left as stock, it takes 5-10 seconds to react to the mouse being moved over it. With it manually bumped up to the same 33 as everything else, it reacts immediately (though there is a little bit of choppiness).Update: The nice command affects both CPU **and** IO queue handling: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t164156.htmlRegarding the tag question: tags (like 'documentation' in this case) don't exist before they are used for the first time. Anyone with >= 150 rep can create new tags (you have 151 now, so you probably couldn't when you asked this). I tagged this 'documentation' so now that tag exists.You might have some better luck asking at tex.se: http://tex.stackexchange.com/I find it hilarious that this doesn't work with Apple's own mail system but it works very well indeed with Gmail using the Exchange settings.This doesn't in fact work with Gmail. I switched from Gmail to MobileMe hoping this problem would disappear.from what I have been able to search, it appears it can't be done. I have tried with firefox and mail.app and I couldn't see any option to this effect. [removing my answer]I did join the dev program years ago. I am using the Snitch, but, and I mean no disrespect, that type of thinking turned out badly for me.  I would get an app to do this, or that, because it was easy, and I became unfamiliar with the actual system. I'm sad about this, because there is a lot to love about the command line tools in osx.  More importantly, when I got hacked, I tried to see what was running and had no clue. Essentially I just want to know what's running, and what it's doing, to find a baseline, so that when odd things happen, I'll know.Heh, I also, am a programmer, but I do a lot of admin also, primarily setting up systems to run my code.  Problematic, but manageable. I'll put what I found out in an answer. It addresses your issues.Strangely, after a day or two it has now started working. It has happened once or twice intermittently, but the problem seems to be largely resolved.

There wasn't anything in particular that I did to fix it.@Jonik, Thanks!  Rereading this question I should apologize for my lack of clarity: The security pdf is _comprehensive_.  That's what I liked about it, and that's what I meant about good docs:  The reading of such should impart practical understanding.  Many times closed source docs seem a bit vague, Apple's particularly so.  This whole discussion, although very valuable, is due to my imprecision.  Sorry about that......"Spell".... *Really*?@Jonik: awesome, thanks!  If I add anything cool I'll share-alike :)Indeed ! Yes, Default folder that was it. But, Ouch, their prices are not nice :-/I just tried Opera Mini and while the choose button is not greyed out, tapping it doesn't do anything. How can I do this?For the record: This issue is still there in 10.6.5.It's funny, the search window is exactly where I looked (good GUI).   But I was tapping, double-tapping, two-finger tapping, etc. looking for a pulldown, or way to change the function from "Google," which is written right in the search field, to "Search page," "Find Terms," etc.  It never occurred to me to type in the Google field, since it seemed to be clearly indicating that it would just Google for whatever I put there. (Bad GUI).This did the trick. Though I didn't have to change the sleep policy, unmounting the drive meant it never turned on in the first place.will someone who can create tags tag this one with Rhapsody?+1 for Cmd+,  Now if I can only remember to use it...@Benjamin:  I disagree.  I've been using a Mac for 3+ years now and still haven't adjusted.  I agree with the concept of adjusting (for instance, Cmd+c instead of Ctrl+c), but I think the home and end thing is just too much for me for whatever reason.  Also, I'm not too concerned with how I will work on friend's or library's computers, since I spend >99% of my time on my own computer.  +1 for an answer that changed the way I use my Mac!Soon to be not so missing when the Mac app store comes out... :-Pi spoke too soon.... the automatic crash report spun it up agin. let's hope it's isolated to the odd diagnostic program like that.Ah.. Why didn't think of that. I only care about documents, too. Thanks!Evernote is amazing. +10Excellent, thanks. I just wanted to add that in step #3, "Files and Folders" in "Finder.app" I also skipped the loop with [exiftool -all= -overwrite_original "$@"]@Ricket: I think those are orthogonal. Homebrew is for CLI Open Source programs.@garikapati yes, there is no difference in setting up the router from a Windows machine or a Mac. You will just connect to the router using Safari and it should all be nice and happy.Try switching the router to another WiFi channel.Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.4. ... Is it possible to move all the files associated with the Movie Project along with it, so that I can reopen and recreate the Movie Project on another computer?I think the only thing I'd add to that list is ~/Library.Rhapsody has a web client and a iPhone app, and the web client for Napster is pretty much the same.  Except Napster is a step worse than Rhapsody, since they don't even have a downloadable client for Windows; they have no downloadable client at all.For some reason, it didn't occur to me that `exiftool` might be able to take multiple files & folders.  As for step 3, restricting the service to Finder.app doesn't really matter -- what other app do you select files & folders in?  BTW, one limitation of this is that the Run Shell Script action doesn't do a very good job of error reporting, so if anything can go wrong, the script should take care of its own reporting.This is a great post Martin!  Would you mind if I make a couple edits for grammar clarity?  Also, I think that 'Applications' is not created in a user's directory by default.  I've never had an Applications folder except at the root.Is that an answer to the question?I'll third this.  Handbrake is great because it has Apple TV settings built in that you can rip to. (Also has settings for iPhone)never trust default settings :)@JFW oh you mean that the project has references scattered all over the hard drive?Awesome!  Thanks.  Not planning (or capable) to build an iOS app, so I'd have to find one that does this or use your suggestion. Will investigate WebClips and hosting a quicktime file locally!  Still hoping to find a solution that lets me load the video locally off the iPad to avoid everyone crunching the network at once.Mind explaining the benefit of a downloadable client and why you would want that? You don't have access to the internet?

Also, your statement:
"since so far, at least, no other "all-you-can-eat" music service has an iPhone app with downloading allowed." is incorrect.

The Napster service has an iPhone app that let's you download songs.

Your question, overall, is very confusing and I don't know quite what you are looking for. Could you explain yourself better? Are you looking for a music manager to replace iTunes? I don't see why having a desktop client is imperative.Thanks... any way to do it using `defaults` ?actually, the unmount didn't survive a reboot. that's all. now i have to find out how to unmount a drive every time i boot up!*Perfect*, Thank you! My desktop is happy now.Everybody, here's a hint: ResEdit, and `FKEY`s :-)I edited my answer to your other question to include a way that you can prevent the drive from being mounted.@Sebastian I suspected as much. I've edited my answer to include a more permanent solution.Casebash says he's from Chicago, so I stuck with describing channels 1-11 (which are the channels we are allotted in the U.S.).  Open sourced firmware usually allows you to switch to 12 or 13.  However, not only is it illegal, it will probably not work on any of your devices and freeze your router :)does that mean you already know the answer? :PIf you have an ebook reader, this app is pretty much essential.@calavera: I'm not from Chicago, I'm from Sydney =P. You must have me confused with someone else@casebash: I must've clicked on someone else's profile or totally got confused... happens quite a lot when you have ADHD lol :)hah i think i clicked on garikapati's profile :)Since iOS 4.0 Apple uses its own database rather than Skyhook's.Every time I remove the daemon it gets put back into place, but that was in 2004. I'll give that a try.@Martin : If you manage to have the Menu dropped (just by a click on the menu name "View"), and then hit the F5 key, it works... Nice bug then. Thanks for you testings.What does "TL;DR"  ?too long, didn't read.This works, thank you!Thanks for confirming my settings should work! Yeah, I'll have to ask the carrier to turn it off. They probably won't though since they're getting rich off of me. It's not visual voicemail for sure; I'm not in the US and that's the only place that works, afaik.WOW!!!! I never knew this trick, thanks!!!I have tried this, and I still do not see a console. I believe that the console may be active, but does not automatically become visible when I open a Java applet.How then does it triangulate the position?  Especially if I'm driving down the road at 35 mph that's not much time to pass info...Well, eventually this did work. I had to change "Run applets:" back to the default "Within Browser Process', and now the console works. I did try both options before, and neither worked.Interesting issue (but sad), have you tried accessing through ssh and seeing the list of processes? Have you tried another monitor (just in case this one is failing to initialize). Do you have a way to avoid the VGA-HDMI adapter? (for the sake of testing). Those are the things that come out of my mind without much further analysis.I know you disabled Fn keys. But even if you press Fn + F5 it still doesn't work? If so You guys should report that bug to apple: http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.htmlVery very important to know!Great tip! Also, [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) does the same thing but in a button in the menu bar, and can also prevent sleeping for a certain amount of time (and it's free).Wow, why didn't I find out about this sooner!? Thanks!!It's alt+shift+K on an English (American) keyboard.Ah, I didn't know about the "Run applets" setting, but glad you got it working :)The USB is there for the webcam, microphone, speakers, and USB ports in the display. Besides, even if USB were eliminated, you would still have the MagSafe and the Mini DisplayPort on opposite sides of the MacBook Air.Do you mean menubar at the bottom, or dock at the bottom? While the latter is easy, I don't think that the former is possible.You were correct, it was just a channel issueI just reset my router(WRT160Nv2) and updated the firmware on it. There is not much changes to my internet speeds, but will be testing the Wi-Fi connectivity from my MBP.This happens to me as well, it's very obnoxious.  However, are you asking a question? :Pglad it turned out to be that easyWould you be able to update your documents if you ran from the Bootcamp partition?@khedron: Disagreed. It's the easiest diagramming application that I use. I *can* use Illustrator to draw diagrams, but OmniGraffle decreases the amount of time I need to do this, *and* has minimal quality loss.:( Unfortunately not available outside of European countries.@robsoft I'd *love* to buy the PowerPack to support Alfred, but I'm afraid that if I do this, it'll get too complicated. (File control, iTunes, ...) I like Alfred the way it is right now.@JFW: Yeah. Wikipedia notes, however, that according to the company, "Spotify will be launched in the United States before the end of 2010"o.0 How did you make the awesome image?!thanks kyle! Image is borrowed from the review at Apple Insider.Any image editing program will allow you to do that, but the question would be better posted in http://photo.stackexchange.com/ or http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/ (my two cents)The long answer?Hmm.  I'm going to try this shortly.  It was my understanding that defaults would give me the possible default options. Your answer suggests that there are others. Where did you come across this default, or technique?  From Safari4? Curious..Ah got it http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=11658773  I did look at this before, or similarI started getting a similar problem to this again. I wasn't getting the error, but email bodies were not rendering. The email would show and the message body would be empty. Also, I couldn't click in the body of a new message I was writing to add text. 
Restarting the iPhone fixed the problem.I think it's a good question, and not subjective.Cautiously indeed, I'll say I think it might have worked.  I'll set up a notification on that directory to be sure, but I am using it, and it's not shoveling tons of gunk into my system.  I shudder to think what my iphone has been doing.  Regardless the quest goes on.  Thanks!Hope you weren't the one driving.That's plenty enough time. It only needs to see the SSID, there's no communication from your device to the router.Actually visual voicemail is available on many carriers outside the US.I updated the question.I know it doesn't have push (hence this isn't an answer), but I prefer Google Reader in the browser. It's very well made.-1 Doesn't provide TOC.Consider re-titling. You already have PDFs, so it isn't creating it from scratch. Also, if you are OK with a (La)TeX solution, you'll get a more detailed answer on http://tex.stackexchange.comWeird. Any Stack Exchange site shouldn't auto log you in unless you still have stackexchange.com cookies. Clear all cookies had a checkmark when you reset Safari?Yes.  All checked, multiple times, and yet logged back in.  Safari: A dog that will not heel.  Yet.@calavera I do know the answer and will answer the question myself soon if nobody else does :-)Both VLC and Skype should have a setting somewhere in their preferences to choose the output device.Do you mean, how do you publish your own books on the iBook store?@ThomasLHoladay -yes, but if I have it in iBook format (ePub or similar) then it is already technically an iBook.I've had this issue too. I think it has to do with file size and formats. I've circumvented this (sometimes) by going into the photos application and copying the photo I want and then pasting it into Keynote.@chiggsy: Did you try others with macports installed at the same time?  If so, did it cause any problems or did they co-exist peacefully?this is absolutely essential for meI looked into it further, and it looks like the VGA adapter does work with the iPhone 4 already, but I still haven't found anything that indicates that the camera connection kit (specifically, the USB adapter) works on the iPhone yet.They can exist side by side.  The main issue is although they all use directories in parallel, $PATH is in series, so one will be preferentially selected.  You can always use the homebrew.profile, fink.profile, macports.profile trick, sourcing different files, but that would be tricky to keep track of.. which flags does openssl have per version, for example.Clickable or just-text TOC?I tried fink and macports together for a while, but found macports suited me better.  I like the newest possible versions I can get with a support structure.  If you just want the odd thing, Homebrew is better, I think, assuming you only need that odd thing, and that osX wont blow it away with a software update, or break a library in /usr/libAs an aside, when I plug in my USB Headphone adapter, VLC locks up entirely, can't do anything but force quit, any currently playing media stops entirely. It's very frustrating.I figured I'd answer it, given that it's been more than a couple of days since Josh's hint.The problem is not a memory/disk space limitation. I am running processes that *intentionally* take **all** the resources they can. A proper mutitasking scheduler should let the system remain perfectly responsive (or at least only cause a minor performance hit) *despite* this, provided the prioritization is set right. However, for some insane reason, the *most important* aspect of the UI is set to the lowest priority possible, and the whole system therefore basically is rendered unusable.I know this is possible, because I run the exact same tasks on my windows 7 box without any issues. I just prefer leaving the mac on all the time, since it takes far less power.Does yous take more than "nearly no effort at all to pull the cables apart"? I find mine utterly useless to the point of me wanting to saw the damn thing off. Just wanted to collect opinions before I did something drastic.@mankoff ClickableTable of contents should be clickable.How did you highlight the pause button and do the circle on the next/accelerate butotn on the image? It's brilliant! :DJust one caveat to go along with "their data should be pretty much inaccessible"... if their password was very simple, for example the user's name, a dictionary word or the same as the combination on my luggage, then an attacker could brute force the FileVault DMG file and access the contents.By the way you can specifically switch to another window without that: Right click an application in the Dock to see a menu of all open windows.Yes - This "hides" the partition, but it's not hidden to viruses and data-stealers though, wouldn't it?Homebrew won't coexist with fink or macports as homebrew installs in /usr/local. Fink and macports compiles will find things in /usr/local and so not compile as expectedI *think* if it has no drive letter viruses and malware can't get to it. But you're asking windows questions on an Apple site. I am an Apple guy first, a Linux guy second, and a Windows guy after all other possible options have been exhausted ;-) -- You should ask on superuser.comi think you'll want to use (La)TeX and re-post this question on the appropriate site.Sounds like the "Find My iPhone" feature that used to be exclusive to MobileMe will be included free in this release.  So that's a plus.brendan: I saw that, but I do not consider it a plus.  My iPod really does pretty much everything that I want right now, and the only thing that would convince me to upgrade to 4.2 would be performance.  The few features I would be interested in upgrading for are either not on Apple's radar (e.g., real Japanese handwriting recognition), or things Apple seems interested in not having (e.g., easy copying of movies).  That's why I'm asking about performance.Nice answer Dori! Did you ever use custom `FKEY` s?A lot more to be honest :)what do you mean by "easy copying of movies"? my movies sync over when i click the sync button.  if you are looking to sync movies in different formats you can use the free VLC app and you simply drag and drop movies into that.Yes I am aware of adium. I put a link with the crash.Maybe you are right, sorry. I read about it being compatible some time ago, but it seems to have been a hoax.No longer works in iOS 4 on multi-tasking enabled devices.What device are you on?so theres no point in it?i think eventually air print will work on printers  connected  to macs and with software for windows@Jonathan - it depends on what app you are using and if that app offers a volume slider. Technically, there is no point, but there is little you can do. There is no way, AFAIK to change it into a brightness slider. Good luck!well if the app doesnt have a slider you can use the hardware buttons@Jonathan - true. I'm not arguing with you or defending Apple, I'm merely explaining how their design was implemented.I know you weren't arguing. My keyboard run out of batteries and its very slow and aching to type with a mouse ;)According to wikipedia, cell tower range is measured in tens-of-kilometers, so we're talking about more than 100x difference in range.I guess now have to admit that the first Mac I ever owned was an LC with System 7 (back in 1991). So no, I don't have much personal experience with FKEYs. **?**this is a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3820/what-devices-can-receive-an-ios-airplay-audio-streamYou can `open -a Skim foo.pdf`.I use Movist, currently. I don't use VLC often, but I do for some purpose that I cannot currently remember, I think it has a work specific purpose, but I've been on vacation :).@chiggsy,@Mark: all good info, thanks!Yeah, guess I wasn't clear, so I summarized it.Ryan: I mean, I've got some video on my iPod, somebody standing next to me has an iPod (or iPhone, or Android, or whatever), I want to send the video to her, we've both got wifi (tens-of-megabits at least), yet AFAICT there's no way to just send the video across.  We have to drive back to somebody's house and get a Mac/PC, iTunes, USB cable, file sharing, etc., involved.  Compared to most everything else the iPod does, I think it's pretty hard, and I think Apple wants to keep it hard.I think @Reid wants a shorter way w/o manually creating all the aliases.But he doesn't have to create an alias to the unix executable if he uses 'open' on the .app package.  I got the impression that he was creating aliases because he thought the only way to start an app directly from the command line was by going all the way into the MacOS directory and executing the file that is the 'real' executable inside an app.  So in that case, an alias would at least save typing the extra three levels of directory structure that you would need in order to start the app.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding his question.TrueCrypt works perfect on mac OS X.[Apple recommends](http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html) to fully discharge the battery from 100% to 0% once a month. I guess this is different than a deep discharge since they don't mention anything about attempting to turn on the device at 0%.No it's not exactly, that is about streaming to old Apple Tv I'm want to know about streaming **to** a Mac or iPhone-1. You've never lived near the ocean before have you? What an absolutely ridiculous answer.I had the same problem as did lots of people based on some quick Google searches this morning. Sounds like a tester at apple will be out of a job today.This answer is right for the wrong reason so there's no need to downvote Philip.  While salt doesn't evaporate, it is in the air near the ocean and can become the nuclei of raindrops.  http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/ASK/rain2.htmlThen tell that to my last car. Those exposed bits of metal just exploded into rust when I was living on the shoreline, but I don't have that problem now living inland.@garikapati let us know how it went :)I'm not debating the merits of the answer as it pertains to iPhones, I'm debating the merits of the "scientific" explanation used to justify the answer.I'm in the US. I'm going to go with you on this one. I'll select this answer if and when it proves accurate. I need to perform the upgrade first.Updated with results of my ssh'in...any ideas?@Martin: No. My iPod Touch is on Software Version 4.1. It is a 2nd gen iPod Touch, if that matters at all.@calevara, thanks - @mankoff is right; it's about length.@JFW: I think there was a parsing problem somewhere -- I think OmniGraffle is fantastic.  Maybe do a search on "can't say enough good things" to see how I was using this?Thank you. This is exactly what I remembered, unfortunately there isn't "VoiceOver Language" field in my iTunes. See my updated question for screenshot.VoiceOver still works fine though, it just isn't enabled in iTunes anymore, but inside iPod Nano itself. I think new iPod Nano 6th gen now generates voice messages on the fly.Edited. better?I mislinked because of the frames. Fixed.Philip: I grew up a mile from the ocean.  The rust on your car was from salt *water*, not "salt in the air".ok so if I understand correctly now, you want to just type the App name as if it was a command line utility in your path?  so `$ foo bar.pdf`?Thanks for not listening to my objection :-( at least a response would have been in order!Yes, the SSD does make a huge difference.Do you have the "iPodVoiceOver.framework" in "/Library/Application Support/iTunes"? I've added instructions on how to install the VoiceOver Kit.Sorry, just checked with a 6th generation Nano, the checkbox to enable voice over is not there. Worth a try maybe is to plug an iPod that support voice over to force install the kit and see if the individual song selection shows up and works with the Nano...After updating to 10.6.5, the issue is still there but seems to happen less often. Also, it has never happened for me when using cmd+tab to switch to another app on another space, so I've gotten into the habit of that. Not exactly a fix of course.I suspect I know why TwelveSouth, in their marketing literature showing MacBooks in BookArcs sitting next to Cinema Displays, omits the cabling.interesting idea. Will try that when I have a chance.For the record, my MBP currently says:  free 58 MB, wired 239 MB, active 1.84 GB, inactive 900 MB -- and the system is performing quite nicely.@Martin - Figured it out, posted answer - thanks for the help!@Am1rr3zA Not for whole Disk Encryption thoughGlad to know you fixed it!!I can hardly wait to try this.  I hate staring at the apple on boot.I'm going to try to do so, but this doesn't answer the question, it is a workaround. I am primarily interested in something that allows developers to use what I assume are native APIs (perhaps "private") in order to register primary media control, and receive multimedia (play/pause/forward/back/volume) events. I don't want to "fix the problem", I want to learn the low-level details of this process.Skype yes, VLC, I don't think so. Too many "preferences" ~_~.@Senseful: Yes, that's not deep discharge, that's just normal usage.[Related](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/q/2094/23), [related](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/q/2459/23), [related](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/q/2360/23). Gaming, there's a StackExchange for that.Although an elegant solution, the OP wants to double click, hence the question ;)Among other things, it your comment shows how many dupes of the same thing are in Gaming SE :)thanks again Martin, that is probably some EU law, still it seems strange that on the official apples site it states 1 year, but is good to know in case something goes wrong in the future. Hopefully I will not need to use it though.Update 2: 10.6.5 didn't fix it for me.So what appears to be the case is that the size indicated on the App Store is the amount of data which will be required to transfer to the device, but once the package arrived and unpacks then more space will be required to accommodate the uncompressed data :)There are a few cons as well. To play offline you need to tell Steam when you are online that you want to go offline - so if the internet goes down you have an issue. Aslo if the steam server goes down (not likely).The most annoying issue with steam is that it automatically update itself on launch: Big updates on a small network can mean a looooong wait before you can play.Thank you very much.This is a bit of a misuse of the edit functionality.

I don't have another iPod Touch to try it with, however. I do like your idea of taking it to the Apple Store to test there, I'll give that a whirl (although I imagine the Apple Store is likely to be quite busy this time of year!)@Martin: The SoundDock works with my iPod Video, yes.`Obviously people have been developing software on machines far slower than either of these for decades.` -- Perhaps, but not running the Android emulator and Eclipse.  That's a very handy link, though, thank you.  I didn't know about the Xbench database.I don't agree... the answer is still pretty similar because he'd be using the same syntax.

Try it with my avatar in this post, it opens my profile b/c the image is inside of a link.Yep. The only other Apple app I have installed is iTunes, and it appears to be unaffected.See my edit to main question. This did not help.Ah, that's why Firefox takes forever to load the first time, but not after.In Activity Monitor, my VM Size is more than 160 GB! Is there some sort of swapfile on my computer that's actually that big?!@penyuan: No. That's theoretically how big the swapfile could go, but the *actual* size of the swapfile is labeled **Swap used** in Activity Monitor.I see, thanks for your help!**Inactive Memory** is partly as you say, though specifically a cache of the filesystem or libraries which might be re-accessed by an application, but is *also* blocks of memory from currently running applications that have allocated but not accessed in some time period (not sure of the exact length of time). The kernel marks those as **Inactive** so as to prioritise them for paging out to disk if the amount of free memory drops too low.iOS might also prevent you from installing an application that will fill your drive by requiring a certain amount of free space on top of the app's required space. This would be to stop you completely filling the drive and then being unable to operate normally with email/sms/calls, saving notes, etc with a full drive.Hmmm, kind of slim pickings.Does it work in other browsers?@mipadi.The computer has only one browser. I have not downloaded any other.Hm, that seems like a bit of a hack, but I guess it could work. So there's no setting to get it back? Incidentally, do you happen to have a black image I could use for this?@mankoff: nice, I forgot you could use -a to tell open that you want an app from the Applications dir.  you should change this to an answer :)@Reid: could you edit your question to include an example command line that you are looking to be able to type?@Airplane Mode: Sorry, that's the only way I know of that works. Have added a black image for you.Awesome, thanks!Doesn't support tab-completion. Requires remembering app names exactly. Don't see why AppleScript is required (especially if you hate it) if shell scripting can do it all.The "grep -v iWork" is in there just because the apostrophe in "iWork '09" is messing things up. Note that if you store apps elsewhere (~/local/Applications) just add that to the `ls` command, and this will work there too.@mankoff which means he needs aliases for sure or extension of tab completionnice one.  i like that it's dynamic so you don't end up with any maintenance issues like cleaning up old aliases.I now tried both methods. For the audiobook I didn't find a way to play it faster. The solution with Quicktime works but it seems to be even faster than 2x.Can you add a little more detail (e.g. a link for that tool)? Seems Google is not my friend here as it only brings up a tool that is not free.I am using Gmail contacts, and I don't think your app works for Gmail contacts; AFAIK it works only with iphone built in contacts.I never realized that open -a could be used without a file name as argument. And I've been using open since NextStep sometimes in the early 90's! Please submit that as an answer so I can vote on it.

So yes, the correct answer is to use 'open -a <application name>'+1 The keyboard I am typing on right now has the same problem, its pushed almost all the way in, except its making any noise like you describe.Can you be more precise? Firstly, how is it related to Apple? Can you host one of those images so we can try to figure out where your problem might come from?I'm using it on a wooden desk, it's not terribly loud, but not as good as before. Will go to a store the next days and see.Oh, does it pop up a new window for you to compose your message in?You have tagged the question as Macbook Pro **and** iMac which OS do you have and what specific Apple Laptop?Yes. I uncheck the botton and it works now. Thanks.Yeah that sounds like a good idea.So you would like to create your own keyboard layout?It's a gif file. Indeed.No, "I would like to permanently modify my keyboard's button labels to match the non-default keyboard layout that I have set on an Apple computer, so that others who do not touch-type can use the keyboard. How do I do this?"I tried that but the result is still the same; all the events that I added on Google Calendar are copied to iPhone calendar, but all the events that I deleted from Google Calendar are *not* deleted from iPhone calendar.On the information it says "Avi video format". And the iMovie is the version is the one in the iLife 2010.Yes I have... No luck. It starts downloading, but fast the KB/s starts dropping until it reaches 0 KB/s and then no emails are downloaded.I'm pretty sure inactive memory gets discarded when the system is low on RAM, since it's not needed and would need to be read from the hard disk either way when it is needed again. Only active memory should ever get paged out. If inactive memory was indeed paged out, this would mean memory was never discarded and the swap file would grow indefinitely.Well, I upgraded from 2 to 8 gb of ram, and the problem solved itself. I'm a bit mystified why, since I don't think the system would use the swap partition until it was completely out of ram, and it always seemed to have 200-300 mb free, even when heavily loaded.Indeed, they come off with some degree of struggle, but they pop back into place pretty easily.  Pulling them off from the lower half seems to have worked best.  Not all of them went back on perfectly, but they are all back on.  Thanks!I thought AirPlay wasn't available on 2nd gen devices?@MrMage Worked just fine on mine, but I only tested audio.Mine looks exactly like that except that I have @ signs after eachThanks, but the Apple keyboard is indeed a "real" keyboard.  I have spent decades typing on all manner of keyboards, and the current Apple keyboard is the best one available for me right now.  I know Apple is renowned for its terrible ergonomics, but their current keyboards and trackpads are, for me, the best ones out there.Have you got another email account and does this work - if not get another free one and try - e.g. gmail fastmail etc.Why is your context menu black? :-)I dont think it is a duplicate. I was looking at comparison of available products. The other question just lists them. Can someone explain? (Editing this question)If you are going to get your first-ever Mac, do your best to get an Intel Mac (Mac Mini or whatever), If you get a Power PC, you may find yourself limited, and it will slowly get worse with time, since Apple no longer uses PowerPC.what do you mean by "view mode"? how do you get to it?Thanx for you reply. I bought a cooler fan but it's fan is in the center and the left side of my macbook gets hot. I know it helps but it does not have the performance I thought it has. When I use ooVoo, the temp of my mac gets to 80 deg but I tested thesmcFanControl and it reduced it to 60 deg. But I want to know if changing the normal fan speed could be harmful or not. Although I only use the app when I use ooVoo.It's a bit silly to list prices here as they change pretty regularly. If somebody reads the description in the answer and is compelled to buy it, they can click through to the app store to see what the current price is.I mean when viewing the regular webpage. Perhaps the normal HTML view shows the full text, even if it isn't viewable in selection mode.THanks for input Lizzan"built in" in that they are automatic, or just available, and you still have to know/execute them?have you tried stack overflow for this one?@bpapa: Fair point. Then again, it may have some value that readers can see *right away* whether an app is free or its (ballpark) cost.@deceze: Inactive memory gets paged out. Active memory gets moved to inactive when it's no longer needed. I suppose if you have so little memory that there's no room for inactive memory, active memory would get paged directly to disk, but that's a special circumstance. Indeed, the swapfile does theoretically grow indefinitely (until there's no more disk space), but that, too, is an extremely rare occurrence.aha, that makes sense.+1, we have an iMac with a Magic Mouse and a Magic Trackpad. Each does some things better than the other, the hybrid works well :). This is the same as having a mouse plugged into a laptop with a trackpad. Sometimes, you just need a mouse.There is no easy way to accomplish this, folktrash. I suggest this one change that bpapa suggests, and ONLY buy child apps on the iPod itself. It's a good first step to maintaining organizational sanity.PDFtoKeynote makes it easy to get PDFs into Keynote: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.htmlPretty sure this isn't allowed.

That's aggravating. Thanks for the answer.That's REALLY helpful to this subject. Thanks mankoff. This makes the transition of media types quite a bit easier.What is WDTV? An app, or actual TV?That didn't meaningfully cover anything the OP asked.It's happened to me several times, however I can derive no pattern. Usually, it seems to go with an OS update. But not always. Sometimes with a sync, but rarely. It's such a huge pain to reset everything that I've currently given up as the pain of a potential re-do is so unforgettable. Thanks for the comment.Thanks for the advice. I'll try this out. I appreciate the iLove. Hopefully there is a more robust solution on the horizon.Hmm, I don't yet have the rep to vote this up. Also, is it auto marked as answered when enough folks push it up? I thought mayhap I could say - this answers it. Alrighty.@VjJaonxV // It is a external multimedia player. The point of my question is how to make a stream server in ipad.If you want to mark it as accepted, click the checkmark.A stream server is all well and good, but knowing what WDTV is dictates what it can connect to and what formats is important. There are solutions such as http://appshopper.com/utilities/streamtome , but they require you to run software on a computer in order to work, and probably doesn't work on WDTV...Thanks, I thought I was probably going to have to use Apple Script or somethingSo this seems to work well - HOWEVER - the text in the PDF gets pixelated when I export/convert the PDF slides to JPG or PNG.  If I bump up the resolution (600dpi or even 1200 dpi) it crashes the photo viewer on the iPad.  Any suggestions for optimizing a JPG or PNG for display on an iPad?@calavera, I was reluctant to post it on stackoverflow, but I did post on programmers and got one answer so far. http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/22106/c-code-navigation-on-os-xSometimes I wish we had the ability to talk directly to people who actually have control over what is being programmed. Otherwise you're just sending an email to some faceless drone that you can't even be sure will be read. Else I'd email them and ask. They never get back to you. Guess I just have to make sure not to change the Open With attribute for huge files. Thanks for being so informative!You could also unshow comments to get just the details you want@Jason You could try to file an [rdar ticket](http://bugreport.apple.com) about the problem, which *should* get read by a developer. But it may either get ignored as not-a-bug or just "anonymously" fixed. :)By comments, you meant "columns", I assume?I was going to suggest that you take a look at Xcode and the developer tools. Xcode will allow you to Jump To Definition and project wide search. I believe you have found your answer elsewhere tho.Yes, I have 3 other accounts from Gmail and they're working fine...@Josh Context menus are black in Snow Leopard.JumpCut and Clyppan are also free and open source.

Visible columns copied, so arrange the columns as you want to see them in text representation. Nice. Thanks.For reference, in English, Davide is saying to go into your library, hit ?p, choose 'Album Listing' (the last radio button option), the theme name will change to 'Songs by album', leave that if you prefer the look of the above screenshot. Then use the PDF button on the bottom left to save as a PDF, or of course you can print it normally. It will look like the above, which is very slick.+ Yahoo Messenger, AIM and iChat don't support Voice/Video chat with Windows clients. For me, the only choice for Video/Voice is Skype.I'd prefer to do these things in Terminal. Also Automator is really helpful!@Alex Thanks for answering. The problem only occurs at low battery life which makes me think that it's unlikely to be RAM seating. I've looked over the system logs and there's nothing exceptional standing out that points to battery hardware failure. Unfortunately I'm not under Apple Care.@Alex It looks like the disk utility is happy too.Got the same issue with my MBP. I'm pretty sure it's the battery though, I even get a "Service battery" message (in the battery status menu). Didn't bother to replace it so I can't tell for sure.@bummzack I've not seen any service messages, but maybe I should just replace the battery and have done with it.Sorry for late reply... sad to see I have more issues now. My MBP is still has issues losing connection for internet. I am still Turn-Off and turn-on the Airport, to get my internet back.  I did some more 'googling...' for my router and found it's having more issues. But not sure how to correct it. I thought of upgrading firmware to open source one i.e. DD-WRT, but it's not available for my version of router.  I am still looking for answers....It doesn't have to be the built-in Photo app.  Can/do third-party apps display photos from the same library/database that Apple's app uses?So what do you get when the image is run through a tool like ImageOptim?

But now I am using an AitPort Express and am experiencing the same issues.I will certainly give this a try. I assume that a crossover cable is required.does the problem go away or become less pronounced if your macbook is closer to the router?When I'm using it for something, it crashes for me at least once a day.  Even when it works, it's usually pretty slow.  That's why I use FlashBlock.  None of the websites that I use need it.I wanted a feature like this a LONG time ago. Pair your computer to your iPhone/iPad, use some client app to push keyboard focus (ala. a virtual machine) onto the iPhone/iPad. That would be wonderful.@mankoff: i agree, your answer is the better answer and is the real solution. I can't control people's voting however, maybe some just don't understand what's being done here, or they're voting in protest of a certain commenter's douchey comments.  In any case, it's really about helping the person who asked the question and I don't really care much about votes as long as the asker gets what they need.  Hopefully Reid will find your answer of use and choose your answer as accepted. if it's any consolation, one of your votes is from me :)and anyway, overall, I think the fact that this question has 4 answers with ~20 votes combined between itself and the answers is a healthy sign for this community.  too many questions just have 1 or 2 answers and 4 or 5 total votes.+1 from another who vastly prefers it to phpmyadmin.Still a 2-click solution to a one-click problem.Gigabit ethernet interfaces do auto-crossover, so a special cable is not needed.+1 for the Cycle Count reference.

It would be good if MacOS noted that the battery was reporting 25% then it all went dark, so on restarting it decided that 25% was the new 0% and threw up a bunch of alerts to get the user to sort out the battery. Maybe Snow Leopard addresses it in this manner, but I doubt it.Ok, i'll try. But why doesnt an error appear?I tried using it for UML stuff and found it really lacking and difficult to useIt's not available on the portal because they expect you to get the update via iTunes. It's how they always do it: once it's out of beta you can no longer download the image.

Maybe the only problem is that you should do some manual configuration (adding a few lines in your .bash_profile. it's quite easy) and there are not much formulas available for brew comparing to mac ports (you can use them both).Indeed. I would just add that you should simply uninstall flash and if a site uses it, write to the author and complain.Sadly, Beta 5 is as awful as a UI can get.Now supporting CUT-Paste for files! :)@Josk K - Sure. I used it straight out of the box. It seemed really clumsy the way you had to choose the right class type, one was just for name, different one for operations, and then one with name, operations and attributes. The connections were also little lines that you had to manually select with the boxes and very difficult to attach correctly.@richardh anytime, hope it helps you!Be aware that you can only gift to people in the same region as yourself: specifically to people whose iTunes account's credit card is issued in the same country as yours! (This might not be a big deal in US but it certainly is in Europe.)Just make sure you use the same iTunes account that you use(d) for the old phone! If you use a different account, then you will be charged again!On a Mac, ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/ has all your apps.

I want to do both iOS development (first for iPad and iPod, making the switch from .NET CF Development), and server stuff (in addition to TCP/IP, Queueing and WebServices stuff I do on other platforms today) and running services (now: Linux, Win).Memory is easy in the new MacMini body style. HDD is not so much (and I understand the benefits of the dual HDs in the server version). And I've never, EVER been in a position to want to upgrade the CPU in a Mac.
You don't need a server to do server development. You need a server to run production services. I would suggest you have two boxes, a development machine, SEPARATE from a production machine, for your own sake, but obviously that's all on you and your finances.If you want to run your own services, use the Desktop version. If you want to run the services provided to you by OSX server, (again, mail, jabber, calendar, ldap, etc.), use the Server version. Hell, if you want the horsepower and the form factor, buy the MacMini Server, and install the MacMini Desktop version. What's another $30? This all comes down to what software OSX Server provides, and whether you'll use it or not.Thanks that helps but I also wanted to find out what data was actually stored with the app on the ipad. I found it in the obvious place, under Apps in the Ipad window in itunes where you can organize your apps. It lets you sort by size as well.Given the finances, and the 'research' status of what I'm going to do (it probably won't pay for quite a while) I'd rather have 1 box soon, and buy a second one over time. Does the MacMini Server come with restore media so I can restore the Server OS if I temporarily install the desktop OS? How should I reinstall? Buy a SuperDrive, or does a regular USB powered DVD drive work too?BTW: Thanks for the fast response, this has been really helpful so far!While true, it's also a PIA.this one looks great, going to check it out for sure.@Martin I tried to add this as a comment first, but I can't find a way on how to do that ? May  be I need more points to see a flag for 'add comment' to any answer/ question ! Suggestions are welcome on this... thxYes, in the box you get a Server OS DVD for installing the Server OS, and you get a second CD of server management utilities you can use on another Mac to remotely administer the server. Since you have two drives, you could always install a ServerOS on one and a DesktopOS on the other. Or make a common one for data, and partition the primary disc into two parts and install one OS on each. We have a non-Apple usb optical drive we use to plug into the Mini's for out-of-OS CD work. In-OS I suggest you just use Remote Disc Sharing.Bear in mind, you submitted it on the lead-up to Thanksgiving. :) Given the likely tens or hundreds of "shopping" apps coming out, you're in line, at a longer than usual time.@leeand00 glad I could help!With maths...? Find a folder of weighty size (or a large file, but you'll get different results for one vs many files) and find out its size. Time how long it takes to copy.

Because I'm lazy. :)No, the OP said "What exactly is Jailbreaking and unlocking doing to an iPhone?" The OP did NOT say "What will Jailbreaking and unlocking allow me to do?" The OP is asking for things like what the SHAtter exploit does, what signture falsifying/checksum disabling is going on, etc. etc. etc. Emphasis on the fourth line: "As an iPhone developer, I'm interested in some **technical answers**." (Emphasis mine.)  Also note my own words. *Meaningfully* cover. The OP is asking for details, he got peanuts instead.+1 for your last comment. ^^ Thanks!I'm not sure- codecs have always been funny things on macs; they're meant to be transparent but sometimes they're too transparent.Or there's always http://www.lipsum.com/ if you don't want to install a widget for this :)That's because it only works in Cocoa appsAs a programmer I cannot live without this!I don't understand why this wasn't upvoted more, Coda is **so awesome!**I thought Mac OS X itself had everything I needed to keep my Mac clean and healthy...Yep it is, freaking awesome.Looks like I need Quicktime Pro for this, as File -> Export is grayed out and there is a PRO label next to it.FYI: this happened before 4.2 with multi-taskingI think what it means is that they haven't gotten around to it yet.  :-)The only make-or-break difference is when the program needs to access more than 2 GB ram.  For that, you need the 64-bit version.  Otherwise, as you say, it shouldn't matter much.brilliant, thanks!By the way, it's called Sweden (one E is enough, even though it's a lovely character! ;)Thanks, that's handy.Clean My Mac clears cache files, broken links and also it has an uninstaller to remove applications completely.It's also worth noting that you may not be able to downgrade the OS on your device as the baseband may no longer be compatible. This is more of an issue on iPhones than iPod Touches though.I might add that there is no reason at all to choose the 32bit version unless you're still on PowerPC. 32bit is legacy code at this point.Not exactly true, I live in Australia and have managed to obtain a US account through some coupon-code trickery. Of course, I've never used it apart from a failed attempt at getting the LastFM app, but it is possible to get an account without associating a credit card.Once I'm prompted for my key's password though, it works so that must mean that it's accepting my key.  It seems though that it's the ssh agent not working for some reason, otherwise it wouldn't prompt me every time for my password.Yah any third party app can access your photos library. But the problem you are trying to solve is such a niche issue that I highly doubt you are even going to find a jailbreak app that does what you are looking for.what you mean by "one window"?While I can't speak for the 1.0 firmware, for version 2.0+ on the old Apple TV you could definitely stream from iTunes. Anything that wasn't synced was streamed from your primary library, and you could also connect it to additional libraries via iTunes sharing and stream from those as well.I have '09 as well. Can you post the graph you've produced?Can you load the console app and see if there are any relevant Finder or backupd error messages under 'All Messages'? Nice profile pic btw - reboot?Are you running the latest update (10.5.8 or 10.6.5?). Is 'bluetooth devices can wake up' enabled?Can you load Console.app and check to see if there are any Mail error messages (you'll need to click 'All Messages' in Console).Open Keychain access and find the item for your id_rsa key, and Get Info it. Tick the box next to Show password (you'll be prompted for your keychain's password) and see if your key's password is being stored. If it isn't, I think you can just enter it right there in Keychain AccessHm, that's not really the graph I had in mind. Thanks for trying, though I suspect that Numbers just isn't capable of what I need.@glen yes, 10.6.5. What does bluetooth have to do with a USB keyboard?@bmarguiles, bluetooth: probably nothing, but I had a similar problem when my bluetooth mouse or keyboard would wake up my lappy whilst the lid was still shut.Actually I think he means what he says... it's possible to have an application with no windows open and the app-switcher still shows it in the cmd-tab list.  Like if you close your last firefox window, firefox remains open, even though it has no actual "windows".  If you cmd-tab to firefox in this case, the only indication you will have that firefox is the 'active' application is the menubar.  Some other application's window, or the desktop, will appear to be the front-most window.I tried CoverSutra but it suffers from the same search problem iTunes does.Wow, way easier than I thought..@Ben Yep, Apple makes it pretty easyGreat suggestion, I don't know why I didn't think of this before! I installed FlashBlock (I'm a Firefox user) and it's simply awesome. This is a great "solution" to the Flash problem.giving LaunchBar a go now, thanks for the tipThanks, I've added that to my answer!@torgengb, when you say potential damage for concrete, you are saying that it can cause damage to the screen/ surface, or the internal of the iphone?@Ngu It's not really possible to impact damage the inside of an iPhone without any noticeable damage on the outside. Falling onto concrete might damage the inside, but you'd DEFINITELY see it on the outside.@Kyle Cronin: Sorry corrected that error. Streaming was supported in 1.x but sure as heck wasn't obvious. It treated the Apple TV like an iPod by default.I agree with Kyle's reply.o_O iTunes is version TEN and still doesn't contain a NOT operator?! Staggering.+1 for death killer.I see. I don't have QTPro, and it works for me; I discovered it's because I have one of the Pro Apps (http://www.apple.com/pro/), which seems to unlock QTPro'd features.He seems to be talking about *applications* not necessarily DRM like iTunes.Are you using the term Remote Desktop literally, as in Microsoft's RDC client for Mac, connecting to a Windows Server? Or Remote Desktop as in Screen Sharing (which is mac-to-mac, or to a VNC server)?+1 Oh yeah, that's great. I haven't thought of this.No sorry. It's the app "Remote Desktop" that comes with Apple OS X.Yeah, this is also what happens, it seems, if in iPhone's Twitter app you view a person's profile and then choose "Create New Contact" or "Add to Existing Contact". (Except instead of a normal http url, it now sets the value to "twitter:@username".)If there was a (simple) way to register the twitter URI on the Mac OS X, I would prefer using "twitter:@username". As it is, using the "http", it works on both Mac an iPhone, but in the iPhone it will open Safari instead of the Twitter application. Using "twitter", the URL won't open on the Mac.That's right ! I always had this toolbar hidden. And there is no corresponding Command Menu for that ! Thanks !CUDA is a SDK. Developers may use CUDA for GPU processing. Graphics problem is completely irrelevant.I'm sure the asker meant the microSIM, not the innards. Maybe I'm expecting too much but I expect that anyone who wants to dismantle the iPad will know to turn it off first (or suffer the consequences). What did I read earlier today? *I don't mind that the gene pool doesn't have a life guard, but why are there so few sharks?*For some apps, there might be no intrinsic benefit at all to run them in 64-bit mode: they might just consume more memory. However, if you're the only app running 32-bit, then a whole 32-bit copy of the libs your apps needs has to be loaded instead of being able to reuse the 64-bit libs the system has (probably) already loaded. Plus, the Cocoa 64-bit runtime has some optimizations the 32-bit version could not accommodate for backwards binary compatibility reasons. So you should probably go for 64-bit.Visor is a great addition--a keystroke slides your terminal in from the top of the screen.Blech. I bailed out of Eclipse in favor of TextMate in my last project.Best powerpack feature: clipboard history. I can now "copy up" three things, then paste them back out in whatever order I like. Brillig!This is not correct. If you leave a laptop plugged in, it is not continually charging the battery - if it was, it would explode! Once the battery is charged, the charging circuit will cut out (or at least cut to a drastically lower voltage). One of the worst things to do to a lithium battery is to continually discharge/charge it, keeping it topped up at 100% will keep it working longer. (For the longest life, discharge it to about 40%, and store it in a cold place)Are you on Comcast? ;)Tip 8. But then again, I have been known to misunderstand answers. http://cl.ly/3Tq4@David Time Warner, actuallyScreen Sharing :PIIRC, equal or higher resolutions will full screen no matter what. Lower resolutions will not. Not equal only.Can't find it right now but there are apps for OS X that let you assign new apps to new URIs.this is a question that can't really have an "answer", or even several excellent opionions! browsers are always changing and every user uses them differently!but I think it's a good question and not ranked as subjective.my wife makes custom ones... mine is blue corduroy and opens on the long side.  just saying :PThanks for the info, I don't want to jailbreak. Let me check with Shazam guys. If I do get any response, will post it here.Turned out it was a bad battery. Good result.Can you give some more details please?Can I suggest talking to the developer of Caffeine - it might be a bug that they want to fix, or they might be able to shed some light on the situation.This was a terrific idea and works like a charm, better even because now my mouse can be my finger. It's a ridiculous step backwards, but it's the outcome I wanted, simply using different tech. Brilliant mate.Maybe it could be a Community Wiki where we add information as the time passes.Can you post the exact error message?Are you able to get your hands on another wireless router, even to borrow? For troubleshooting, you want to replace pieces of the puzzle to figure out the source. Try a different router first to make sure it's something on your computer.Upgrade from what? 4.1? 3.x?i thought may be was misreading it or it was benign, but I guess reporting it would be prudent.You could look at this discussion http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2525736&tstart=0This probably belongs on StackOverflow.I did that, tried it with an Asus router. Didn't work either. At the University connecting through Cisco VPN it works like a charm.Tip 8 is correct ("Do not leave a charged battery dormant for long periods of time."). My comment wasn't totally clear: if you are *using* the battery, then you should be keeping it charged. If you are not using the battery, you should drain it to 40%. You should try to avoid draining it completely as much as possible.Alright. Sorry about being a stickler about this, but I just want to have clear answers here. :)But it *is* impacting my computing experience.  My computer starts to crawl when Safari eats up a lot of memory and I usually have to shut it down or restart it.It was more on the end user side...*Pod of MacBooks*.... sounds like some kind of horror film that would make Steve Ballmer scream like a little girl.++ for rsync and/or Carbon Copy Cloner.  I use both in different situations, and they're definitely the way to go for ensuring data integrity on copy.@Martin: nice find on arrsync... I'll have to check that out.  rsync is awesome but it has a ridiculous amount of options which can become quite overwhelming if you're a casual user.Thanks - I use (and own) SuperDuper, but I double checked and it will only copy full disks/images, not individual folders.  I've already started using Arrsync, which seems pretty good.Stink! That sucks. I really like safari and don't have that problem, but I do notice the high memory footprint. How about chrome? It still uses webkit to render the pages.What is physically between you and the wireless base station?  Lead paint, microwave, TV, etc?@Martin - thanks!  Will do.  For now I think arrsync will do the trick.  CheersThis seems like a simple enough solution, thanks.Am I right that this involves "storing" the sessions prior to closing them? It seems like an extra step beyond just using History > Reopen All Windows from Last Session.ditch the other monitor sebastian and master spaces! Keeps you neck straight.Thanks, I'll try that and see if it works!FYI for the curious, if you were not all aware. CarbonCopyCloner is built on (patched, for extended Mac/HFS permissions) rsync. I can't speak for SuperDuper.One more helpful one: Shift + Control + Eject = sleep display, NOT computer. I use that as a Windows + L (lock screen) equivalent in Mac.Some of your lines are *'ed, with no explanation. What are the *'s?@Vxj thanks, added the info :)I agree, I have had that feature fail on me a couple of times. A dumb flash site decides to crash the whole browsers and voila! the whole session is gone.I'm confused.  Doesn't "sync" *mean* it's transferring all my iPod's data to my Mac?  (HT1766 says "iTunes creates a backup of your iPhone or iPod touch when you sync" and "iTunes will back up the following information" ... "Camera Roll (Photos, screenshots, ...)".)@Ken iTunes does create a backup, but the only use for that backup is to restore it back to your device. In order to actually get the image and video files you'll have to transfer with iPhoto, Image Capture, or another photo management application.me too me too :)@debug not really, spaces is not a substitute for dual/triple screen. The ability to quickly switch back and forth content or having the ability to quickly monitor something else without having to hit an awful and slow hotkey (that will perform an even worse animation) is not the same. Two or three correctly positioned screens should not cause any more neck stain.Why do you think TV tuners are *impractical*? They're very simple to use, and most have at least a couple different input options, plus recording software. Additionally, there are *no* mini-DP adapters for TV-centric inputs that I'm aware of. You can find them for DVI, but that's about it. Adapting *from* mini-DP *to* a TV input is possible, but not the other way around. Not only is a TV tuner practical, it's the **only** reasonable option for what Evert wants to do.There's a TV near the base station and a wireless phone. But the problems stays even when both are unplugged.Thanks! I'll give it a try as soon as I'm at home.Where can I find the correct control sequences? Such as the `\033[5~` in your screen shot?Ahhh. I'm sorry. I typed my answer wrong. I meant I thought it was impractical to simply hook to the Wii. However, that is not entirely true as you pointed out.Thanks! I didn't know what to search for. Now that I know the page, it is clear to me.They just link to a forum post, check my original attribution link at the top.  I've removed them from this post.I've activated spaces as well, and find it fascinating how it's pushed me towards keyboard shortcuts. Of course it's a *long* way to the dock from the 2nd screen, so that's part of it, tooJust to be clear -- it is not possible from the end user side.LOL! I already had a license for PhoneView, but didn't know this feature! I'll add the details to complete the procedure, for future reference. Open PhoneView, enable entire disk (preferences), put all the photos in one of the APPLE100, or APPLE101 subdirectories of the DCIM directory, then go into PhotoData and delete /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite and /PhotoData/PhotosAux.sqlite. Last step, close and reopen the Images app, and the iPhone will rebuild the database. Sweet, thanks!the point being that you can visually see which apps have no open windows more easily than with cmd-tab.But does this work without also continuously removing and re-adding things - i.e. do the libraries themselves get synced to each other? If I rip a new album on Computer A and sync my phone, what happens when I attach to Computer B? Removed from phone or added to computer?Philip: I don't want to prevent iTunes from ever opening automatically. That is exactly the problem. I *do* want it to open automatically for the synced computer (yes, I'm sure, it's the machine I started with). If you're saying the preference used to allow this to be changed per-machine, then you're answer should be right but iTunes is broken.Forgot to add: you are correct though, this appears to be the place to provide feedback. Thanks.I turned 'Configure IPv6' off without success. Transmit rate still drops to 1...What Mac do you have? Which version of OS X? Open the Console application (in Application/Utilities) and see if something suspect gets written in the logs when this happens.I don't think TV tuners are suitable for gameplay.  They usually introduce a slight delay in outputting the signal, on the order of a second.  This isn't a problem when watching TV, but for playing games it would make it unusable.Can you hear the disk spinning?how can this be done?nice one, but it's too much visual clutter for constant use.Your first line needs to read "AREN'T sync'ed to each other".I think I beat you by a minute only because you went all fancy with formatting :D.:-) I came here from StackOverflow, where they punish bad formatting with beatings. It's a hard habit to break!thanks. I couldn't find anywhere this shortcuts.@Cleggy Let's know how you get on. I'm a kiwi, and we usually purchase AppleCare for all our laptops - but I'm keen to see how the CGA and Apple play together.Seems like I missed it. Thanks!@zneak Sure thing, I hope the answer is still usefulIsn't this more of a StackOverflow question?I gave the correct answer to senuti, but upvoted both.  Using these tools, I remember what it was like to actually use my devices to their capabilities.  Thanks!The solution here is ipfw. No other way to trust the result.Hmmm. Have you confirmed that it's running the [current version](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL38) of the software? Also, you mention having a wireless phone near it. Certain ranges of wireless will interfere but I don't remember which ones; Shutting off the phone's power should clear it up if that's the problem.I used ILM and it works a treat for that sort of thing.Accept your own answer.@yanis - if there's something specific you want to know, your best bet is to open a new question.My Windows configuration is set to the default colours, and resetting them does not seem to change the Safari colurs. Thank you for the idea though :)I'm using Arrsync and it's decent. For free I can't really complain.SO is a bit of it's own world. Add to the fact that I'm not a programmer and it makes sense that I'm not nearly as active on it and haven't ingrained it's elitist ways into my habits :).@VxJasonxV: you can't accept your own answer to your own question until 2 days have passed (otherwise I'd have accepted by now).Yeah it's running the current version. I tried that with the phone, no luck there. As written in my question update, the only solution I currently see is using 802.11n 5GHz.I'll recommend the Airport Extreme as a great router. It's been rock solid where our Linksys wasn't able to get a signal through.Forgot about that limitation :). Glad you were aware and intend to do so, consider it a tip to any other passersby that they too can do such a thing.Yeah. Whatsapp does it fine for example.Well, no idea. It is Windows 7 Enterprise and OS X 10.6.5 . All systems updated with the latest updates at the time of writing. Installed the developer preview of OS X 10.6.6 with the same result.Well, no idea. It is Windows 7 Enterprise and OS X 10.6.5 . All systems updated with the latest updates at the time of writing. Installed the developer preview of OS X 10.6.6 with the same result. But I have no OS X Server to test, yet. Maybe that makes the difference? Also, it seems to depend on boot order as I read somewhere. (sorry I edited too slowly)Additional note: Windows 7 is installed on a Bootcamp partition. But this should not matter at all. (Did not try Parallels with Win7, yet). About the "no domain master": I think this is not an option. One will always be elected. I just forced OS X to win :-)Thank you, I think i will end up using the iPhone version on the iPad with the 2X mode enabled.Ack! Thanks for catching that.Is there a reason plugging the USB?Ethernet dongle into the MBA itself won't work for you?Just a caveat that New Zealand and Australia (and other countries) have tethering as a free option.not putting this as an answer, since I'm not certain of it... but wouldn't one possibility be to wipe out iTunes's idea of the phone, and then sync?  This might or might not be possible from the iTunes interface, but perhaps there are files that could be edited or removed, to make it happen??  Just an idea...Hmmm, this is curious indeed... I'll have to try playing with the priorities on my laptop, next time I'm doing an import.  I've always figured that the main thing that was going on was paging, and that that was causing the problem -- and looking at paging stats seemed to bear that out.  Perhaps changing the priority changes the likelihood that those processes will get paged out, and thus keeps them responsive???  More investigation required, I imagine...  especially if you claim to have 200-300mb free (I know I have less than that, often).Well, at least there is still a way to lock the orientation.Can you compare Shazam to SoundHound - which one is better?RTM is actually a paid app - it's free to download but after 2 weeks it only works with a paid account on the RTM website!For what it's worth, I just got this too...  Hopefully it'll resolve itself for me, as well.  :-/not anymore. the app is now free (if you want advanced notifications features, then you need the paid account)I'm forced to use both: SoundHound is generally better at finding a song. I had many situations where Shazam didn't know a song but SoundHound found it easily. However, SoundHound isn't sensitive enough. As an example it's not possible at all to catch a song from the radio in my office. Shazam on the other hand seems to adapt and can easily record songs also from this same radio.ty tho did mention i had already upgraded, will always sync in futureSince I am using tweetie on the mac and the phone tweetie:@someone workes well for me. +1 to JonikDoes this include apps? How do you use an app he bought on your phone? It should ask for his password, but then does it work with his apps and your apps on your phone?Your mail won't be stored in the DMG. No app really writes back to the DMG. The reason your mail was still there is that Thunderbird (or any other app for that matter) writes most of its content to ~/Library/. Therefore, your mailboxes are stored there, as well as your preferences.What widgets ARE you using?The latest one. I'd say 4.1. Anyway I have done it. And I agreed with Kyle's answer.I am using the default widgets and put 2 photos from web.. I added these pics more than 6 months ago.that's a nice trick!thanks very much, howerver I cannot choose enter as the shortcut because it puts nothing as shortcut instead. I need to add something + enter but I wan just enter alone. What should I do?@Dori The MBA has exactly two USB ports, and when it is in clamshell mode it has exactly one free USB port.  Having to choose between plugging in a thumb drive, or a camera, or a scanner, or an iPad, and network connectivity means trouble.  It also would mean dragging a fifth wire into the configuration, because the Cinema display has three, the WiFi trinket has its own for four, and the ethernet cable makes five.  If it's in the Display, I can hide all that with wireties.How about Desktop Snow Leopard ? FileZilla works or any native OS X software available ? Looking for Free/ Opensource one.and in your screeshot there is `Finder.app` , when I select Finder fro the Application dropdown ads `Finder`@CIRK I set that My OS X show the Index so in my screen shot you see Finder.app but if you don't set it just show Finder. and also I said that you can not use enter in normal way (also can't use enter + something else it didn't work for me) I just want to show you a way to change system shortcut.Good point... this question is primarily with regards to operations in the US although it could be interesting to compare options in other countries (so jealous!).@Dori, to see what the MacBook Air in clamshell mode looks like, check this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4146/how-do-you-connect-the-new-macbook-air-to-the-cinema-display/4170#4170@jmlumpkin - as I said: "anything we both want, we share." Yes, Home Sharing includes apps. First, I use my iTunes account to see what he has and import those I want. Then when I sync my iDevice, there are no "his apps," just mine. There's no difference between the two (minus some updating quirks).I'll give that a try. This also seems to answer my other question over at superuser: http://superuser.com/questions/144534/can-i-build-a-vpn-on-top-of-tor  I'll upvote you there as well if you copy your answer :-)After reading their docs, I am not sure how this works, actually. TorVPN is first a regular VPN, but they say you can "optionally enable a transparent TOR tunnel". Is that possible on the iPod as well or do you need to run TOR client software on your end?This should probably go on stackoverflow (or superuser).Same here. iPod touch. Very annoying.Yes, but is there a way to distinguish between "recently-used apps and apps performing the above limited-multitasking functions"?@Dori - Appearance. Limiting the cables which the user must connect and disconnect. Physical placement of the ethernet cable - running it up the back of the desk to connect permanently to the unmoving Display instead of extending it to the foreground where it can join the Display cable in a knot.  The second port on the MBA will usually be easier to access and less obstructed than any of the ports on the Display, so keeping it available for ad-hoc uses such as phones, cameras, and thumb drives.  Bootcamp Windows 7's complaints about Display-mounted external hard drives being non-USB 2.0. More?The next version of the iPad will have features of sufficient coolness that a meaningful number of current iPad owners will want to trade up.  Plus, many households will want to have more than one iPad.Pretty much anything you buy will be outdated in a few months ...OpenVPN does seem more stable than PPTP, but that is unfortunately not an option on the iPod.Do any of the reasons for using TOR not apply when using an iPod?I think what that's saying is that TorVPN is actually just a VPN service, which, again, your iOS device can leverage PPTP access for. And additionally, TorVPN allows you to add on Tor entry service on top of that.@Matthew Frederick it doesn't cause it's already version 4.2, they are doing updates my major version and not by build version :( - I sent a feedback to Apple regarding this though.but if you have a beta version, that version is already 4.2.x and it won't be updated by iTunes!-1 for being purely speculative. Theres no sense in asking questions about unannounced Apple products, and even less sense trying to make purchasing decisions based on that muddy crystal ball. Decide based on what you know today - or decide to postpone your decision until new devices are announced.A question without question. Amazing ;-)When I did this with my wifes iPhone, it wanted me to enter my password. I don't mind, just didn't know if she could run apps under her account any more.The only issue with iCal is that you have to be logged in for the task to run (correct?)So far, after 3 reboots, this seems to be doing the trick. Thanks!I added clarification :) Yes it warns you, but merging is what i'm after here. In Windows you also get a warning (and a warning for every file/sub-folder) before you over-write something. OSX outright deletes EVERYTHING at the destination.possible duplicate of [Why does copy replace stuff instead of merging it?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1470/why-does-copy-replace-stuff-instead-of-merging-it)Two days ago my sleep time was only maybe 3 seconds. Now it is 20-30 seconds. Is there a way to go back to that? Could it have something to do with launchd/httpd stuff that I changed?Did you install the NTFS-3G driver?I have no idea. One way would be to check running processes / disk activity before attempting to sleep and then checking how long it takes to sleep.I did not. I don't think I should need to for read access, though.Thanks. Using Console.app I saw lots of error messages related to nginx -- I had a misbehaved nginx (web server) launchd configuration that kept getting relaunched every thirty seconds. I uninstalled nginx (since it wasn't working anyway) and used launchctl list/stop/remove to get it out of launchd and now sleep is back to taking seconds (the backlit keyboard turns off when I hit sleep, instead of before where there was a thirty second delay). Hopefully this info (not nginx per se, but the fact a rogue launchd or other program can cause sleep issues) is useful to someone else out there.I will try removing some widgets and see what happens. what do you mean by 'force quit', the widget or Dashboard client process from Monitor ?@torbengb: Good point. Looking at this site's [Area 51 entry](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/151?phase=commitment), something very similar is listed as definitely off-topic ("What's Apple going to release in the next generation iPad?").Are you using FileVault?yes, I think you must be logged in to do this. I would recommend the launchd process over this, but some people would rather just use iCal and are always logged in.both \t and ->| can be esoteric to individuals. Could you change `->|` to `->| tab`?OSX cannot read NTFS natively. NTFS-3G is for both read AND write access.OS X has had NTFS support from 10.3, according to wikipedia. On my other Mac, this worked as I described, and I didn't have to install NTFS-3G. Either it is installed when you setup boot camp or parallels, or it is not needed.@VxJasonxV - no problem. Done.ickket no, I'm notOh, it will be her gadget, not mine. Over-generous grandparents.Does the NTFS volume appear in /Volumes?Exact duplicate of that question :-)I agree that Apple didn't want to confuse users, but I think the package argument is irrelevant... Folders and Packages are already handled differently. In fact a package is not the same as a folder. Both are *directories*, but they packages and folders are treated differently in the GUI.iCal is a much easier solution! See the screen caps I posted. I sure can see how they could be intimidating :-)Well, not exactly. The accepted solution suggests a complete Finder replacement, which are generally not free. I'm looking for a system hack just to get around this one "feature".This would be a good reason to buy the accidental damage insurance for the retailer.  I bought it and I have a teenager...@VxJanoxV: Snow Leopard can read NTFS natively.  Files on my NTFS Bootcamp partition even appear in Spotlight searches.@Thomas L Holaday, I will look. Unfortunately I'm in the middle of something and cannot right now. I do not believe it is, however.Except that I have many dev friends who installed the beta 4.2 and then iTunes updated their devices to the full 4.2 when it was released. I think the problem is restricted to you, or at least a small subset of devs.Rogue apps are nearly impossible. I have heard Skype is a pig, however.Also, possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4740/iphone-3gs-battery-oddities@VxJasonxV, I didn't have Skype installed.@VxJasonxV Similar, but I think that it's not an exact dupliate (this is about how to check the battery, the other one was about whether the battery needed conditioning)I guess I'll cross post my answer, to the extent relevant, because fundamentally the answer is the same. Yes, the requested answer is different, however.`It sounds like it just plainly is not holding a charge after a certain discharge point`, what do you mean by this? Are you saying that if the battery drops below 10% ( say) then it will continue dropping regardless of whether you use it or not?@jmlumpkin - your password (i.e., your permission) is needed to set up Home Sharing in the first place; after that, it's not necessary.In a nutshell: I'm saying I'm pretty sure your battery is damaged and can't hold a full charge, despite reporting 100%.Have you seen how long it will go without being charged before it dies?I also thought the battery was going bad, but the fast discharge happens now only once every 3-4 weeks.  At all other times it behaves normally.I've already tried this; I've also restored the default settings, but it didn't work.That seems to be a double security hole. First your iPhone won't lock, and then the thief will also have access to the VPN.@Matthew, don't be like that.. drewish had the same problem, don't say that "I have  friend that happen this and that", We're here to help, share your own stuff!I don't know. As I have big libraries in all computers, I always disable automatic syncing and selectively copy content to my device. Probably removed from phone, I guess. If you want to prevent that, and are in the same local network, enable Home Sharing to copy directly between computersIMHO: Finding a suitable case is a symptom of another much more worrying problem which is the "over-generous grandparents" - but that's off-topic for this site.I'm not dismissing your problem, I'm certain that you're legitimately having it. I'm merely pointing out that it appears to be limited to some people, not something that all devs are experiencing. That way when people visit this topic in the future they'll have all the information.Thanks for the answer! I found the folder in Windows and in my Mac OS Snow Leopard there is no MobileSync folder, maybe it is the "Sync Service" folder. I did not try it yet though!Whow! I was not aware of such a reverse effect, which is not ok still (my machines should see *any* user of their own shares), but clearly explains it. I will check that today if I can confirm. Could be something to discuss with Apple!Yes others have mentioned this but I don't want turn off lock mode because it's inevitable that I will forgot to turn it back on leaving me at risk.awesome, thank you so much.just for clarification, your screenshots are for launchd setup, correct?But you do have to set up a password I think for the remote one if connecting to the screen sharing 'service' if you will, without setting up another VNC server.Have you ever used your iPhone as a hand calculator while working for instance ? If you don't turn this autolock during that time, you'll become mad. If there are right : there should be an app for that ! An app that switch the auto-lock on at startup, no ?I am doing it now - it has been about three days, using it about 1 hr / day, without any phone use.I tried that route, by adding it at the end of the google URL, but it's giving some error.Yup, because Google doesn't accept the ?url=%@ argument. I haven't found a way to use it.I have also experienced this, but I don't think the battery is bad because it happens only very occasionally.  See my question at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4740/iphone-3gs-battery-odditiesI think there's more to this than just "your battery is bad".  That doesn't explain the actual behavior I see with my 3GS.I meant the dashboard client process from Activity Monitor. I tend to "force quit" rather than quit, but you can try "quit".I removed 2 Webclips and couple of widgets, but I am not seeing any improvements, instead the memory consumption went up.So would that speak to installing apps by hand, and perhaps only using Migration for users?It's not by design, what could it possibly be other than a bad battery? Perhaps a bad logic board/some battery sensor, but replacing the battery means replacing the whole device, which means you'll get it fixed pretty much regardless. This doesn't sound frequent enough to be a firmware bug or anything software related.I tried closing all the widgets I have, and after Dashboard Client disappeared from the Activity Monitor I added a couple of clocks. The Real Memory was listed as 24MB now. Can you tell me what are the widgets you have ? May be I can check. I suspect Webclips are the memory hogs, I guess they function equivalent to the same safari Tab (loading all the JS from the page and all).There is no "system hack", you'll need to install third party software or use unix tools.Mac-to-Mac Screen Sharing leverages VNC, but has some extra special things on top. If you're going to use any other VNC client, you MUST configure a VNC password. There's a big difference between Mac-to-Mac screen sharing (which allows you to log in as a system user), and *-to-Mac VNC (which needs you to configure one static password).Is there any hint as to when custom SMS tones will be possible?It won't happen until it happens. :) I have absolutely no idea when it might/if it might. E-mail sjobs@apple.com? I think that's his current address. I suggest looking around first before sending mail there. Other people seem to be having pretty good success with that.don't hold your breath or you might suffocate...They've gone upwards of 9 years without meaningfully changing the Finder. It's simple. Why would they change it now?

I couldn't seem to find this.iCal on the phone, or Mac? Also no, moving from Google Calendar, and don't need any other app. And yes, I have developer tools installed, but don't have a problem with the current sync times - and you can do it manually any time you want.Select the calendar then on the menu bar "Edit" and then "Delete." Sorry, I thought it also accepted the big delete key, but it doesn't.I'd generally say to give Migration Assistant a try, then reinstall anything that gives you trouble afterward.  While MA doesn't work for everything, it generally works well enough to be easier than just reinstalling everything.changing the default works. But still don' think you can delete this calendar from the iPhone. And it doesn't sync back to my iMacs copy of iCaliCal on the mac, sorry.  Reason I said busy sync, is because when im at work I can add an event to google cal, and within 5 mins, its on my iphone. Same in the opposite direction.. if im on the go, and add a event to my iphone, its on my google calendar within mins.  The default sync times are not "push" so changing it to 1 min interval, makes it feel like it is "push"yes you can.  I have only Mobile me calendars showing.  If I had my mac, i would show you step by step directions on how to change this..It's not a fair characterization that launchd is "proprietary." Apple eagerly open sourced it at http://launchd.macosforge.org/ and it has been ported to FreeBSD.@ohmantics: Ok, fair point. Is "specific" a better description?Close enough. :-) Apple created it, but I expect it will see wider adoption across BSD-like OSes.I don't fully understand your comment, but I am guessing your PCs are desktops. This is not a "reverse effect" in the case of a laptop! It's very handy when you travel between multiple wireless networks, some of which are public and you wouldn't want your shares wide open.I actually really like iTunes in Mac OSX. The Windows version, not so much; but Mediamonkey (a Windows-only app) can manage music on iPods and iPads, and multiple Linux apps can also manage them.Calculator, weather, clock, flight status tracker, iStat Nano, iCal, Ski Report, tile game. But now I closed these widgets (iCal, Ski Report, tile game). Still it shows 141MB. FYI.. I didn't quit/ force quit the Dashboard client.If the OP wanted technical questions he should have asked specifically about *either* Jailbreaking *or* unlocking, as these are two rather separate processes to do to the phone. I've Jailbroken an iPhone 3G and an iPhone 4, but I've never unlocked them because I've never needed an unofficial unlock.Thanks, that did the trick. Excellent find!Thanks Am1rr3zA for pointing out how to style keyboard shortcuts; that looks much better. :)@pithyless: no problem! i love keyremap :PIm curious knowing more about unlocking,how can i find the baseband crash logs?Just out of curiosity - did you ever hear back from the Caf dev?But boy is it ugly!How can you be so sure? Are you the whole world? Unix is running down below, there's _gotta_ be a way! _\*naivelook\*_ ;)nope, have been too busy of late. I will post an answer if I figure it out/ hear back.+1 for South ParkCould you let me know when you check this out? I still can't find how to remove them on the phone. And haven't seen how they even show up on the computer.yah, googles built in sync relying on exchange somewhat worked for me, but was messing up my contacts too much. So with that and better calendars through MobileMe, I switched back.see this recent question on stack overflow:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4382466/c-development-on-mac-osx-10-6@glenneroo: regardless, if there is, it would show up as an answer to the other, duplicate of this question :)I thought so too, but macports requires the developer tools/xcode.  see the SO question I linked above.I hate that they give no choices for being anonymous.  Why do I have to use my real full name to sign up?Hmmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but if the "On My iPhone" calendar isn't getting sent to iCal, I'd check your sync settings in iTunes (while the phone is connected) to make sure all your calendars are getting synced. Something to try, anyway.@debug: lol, i love your optimism! :P@glenneroo: There's nothing built in to the OS that supports this. Sure, I could be wrong, but I am 99.99% sure that you'll need third party software for this. A good portion of "system hacks" are actually properties which can be enabled with the `default` command, and there's nothing under there that does what you want. :-(@calavera: thanks.  @MartinM: you make an excellent point.  Read OSX book. has a lot of history of the whole OS itself, and why Mac  OS X is so awesome, powerful http://www.osxbook.com/Maybe I'm missing something but `type xxxx` usually works better for me.@Thilo No there isn't.Huh. Never knew about `type` before.+1 for your snazzy `<kbd>` tags!Fair enough. Is it OK if I leave this open, in hopes that one day some hacker-hero will ride in and save the day?Actually here in Austria all the shops only ordered the low-res versions and indicated we should use the Apple store directly (i.e. hi-res screens are special order, wtf?), or that they can put the order in for us. We got lucky though, since they just happened to have one hi-res glossy ordered, but without a buyer :)What a backwards racket.I think Apple want do the same thing that Last.fm did.`dscl`? Maybe? A starting point for looking, I've never tried it myself. You'll note that your user account is completely absent from /etc/passwd. You might have luck looking at the OSX Server docs.Thanks!Yeah, Last.fm + Twitter + Facebook "Likes".@Calavera instead of question, can we make this as wiki ? Personally I don't see anything odd being a Question.Agreed, we gain nothing being a Ping member, Facebook + Twitter works for me. That's the reason I didn't even enabled in my iTunes.That's not ideal either, because that make the name look weird. Thanks for the answer though.Oh, btw, "Herr" is German, "Meneer" is Dutch.That makes the name look weird when only the first name is displayed. Still, that doesn't happen too often and solves the problems I mentioned, so +1.That only works in Address Book, not with all stuff (iOS, for example) that uses the contacts from AB.I wish I could double vote up. That's awesome.What do you dislike so much about the Dock? I don't really have a problem with it. Knowing what issues you have would help create better solutions.I've not used dscl on a non-server Mac, but it stands to reason you could get it to work. The OSX Server docs do give an overview of what you can do with the dscl tool.Please don't post duplicate questions: http://superuser.com/questions/220608/recommend-me-a-productivity-workflow-toolnice one mankoff!@mankoff I can't close as a dupe of a question on a different site. Once we launch and there's a migration path, the questions could be migrated and merged, but until then it's OK to ask on both sites.ARD is *an* application name, yes. However, neither the binary nor the protocol are called "Remote Desktop". Also, ARD doesn't "come with" OSX, so no, Pierre's comment (which I was responding to) is not fine. It's the wrong name and only causes confusion.When builtins fail you, resort to scripting... Nice. Definitely works:
>`$ python -c "import os; print os.path.realpath('bin')"`
>`/Users/jason/Applications`.
I symlink ~/bin to ~/Applications in order to have a unified .bash_profile/$PATH across Mac and *nix systems.See I marked this question as a favorite and intend to come back here and copy from your answer whenever I need keyboard tags XDLaunchBar... Alfred... Google QuickSearch Box... Even Spotlight!That first one sounds *perfect*, but I just did it and now, when I *click* an app in the dock, the system no longer switches to that space. If it also solves the issue I was having, I can live with it however :-)@mankoff: It does, or worse, it will do it when i am *typing something* in one app, it will switch me away from that app to a space with another app. It often happens when an app is unresponsive. Like earlier today when I asked this, iTunes couldn't find some songs and was just giving the spinning beachball. I switched spaces to write some code, and every ~5 seconds it would switch *back* to iTunes, which was still unresponsive.@Josh I find the first one necessary. What if I want two terminals open on different spaces? Or a new browser in the current space? Not easily possible if the spaces keep switching elsewhere...@garikapati: I actually intended this as a wiki question.  But if you check my post on Meta, the powers-that-be removed the option to make a question community wiki except moderators.I would be nice if you could format this question a little cleaner, especially that "GMail AIM Google Apps" line. Click the yellow backgrounded '?' icon for details.Groups != List Segmentation. Putting all your buddies on one account into a group = organization hell, and will really start to suck down the road. Especially if (god forbid) you move onto a client other than iChat.The Late 2008 Model mac book pro was before they switched to the uni-body design and does not have a mini-DVI port, just a regular DVI port. Also, my monitor doesn't flicker, it turns on and off, when it's on the signal quality is perfect, then it turns off, then on , then off again@Calavera that's just my opinion, anything works for me ;-) Anyways, I don't see much use of using Ping, Facebook + Twitter works me and most of the people, I guess.I'm still haven't gotten around to fixing the damage I had done to my Office install trying o get around this, but I didn't want to leave this hanging, and this is a completely logical answer.I think the question would be better received if it didn't editorialize so much.@Dori: yup, totally fine.  I actually wanted to see what kinds of CW discussions might be agreeable on here.is this on OS X or iOS?I actually did eventually find this! Earlier this week I set up Sheepsafe and got it working. It connects to an Amazon EC2 server I set up (which will be free for a year, thanks to Amazon's free usage tier) and I'm rather happy with how it turned out.or rather, a way to declare certain apps as "not security-relevant". They could then be accessed without unlocking the phone. The whole thing opt-in, of course.I tried this, and the thing I was trying to do in the app I was using, works!  I guess I should reboot my iPod every few days now.  :-)Looks good, but the main issue is, I am unable to see anything on preferences window after I press Cmd + , it's just a blank screen. So is my choice is to re-install QS or any troubleshoot options ?@Ken Rebooting might be a bit excessive, but I usually go through and quit memory-intensive apps (games, etc) every few days on my iPhone to keep it running smoothlyI just updated my question with screenshot.Memory-intensive apps will be forced to quit by the OS. That they're showing up in the fast-app-switching list doesn't mean anything except that they've been run at some point. Realistically iOS doesn't keep anything besides the first 2-4 apps running. The occasional reboot doesn't hurt, especially if you've upgraded the OS.@Matthew That's what's supposed to happen, but sometimes it doesn't. I've gotten low memory errors on more than one app and I've noticed a definite improvement when quitting apps to free up their memory.Interesting, I haven't experienced the same. I wonder if the specific app matters, perhaps an app or two that's especially leaky causes more trouble for you.Ah, I agree that "comes with" is misleading. But the remote administration client binary (to which I assumed he was referring) isn't called Remote Desktop?I'm quite self-respecting and personally find the Dock usable for all I need it to do.So does the Dock if you click and hold on the icon of a running app.I use Spotlight instead of QS too. Works fine.It's worth downloading XCode if you are developing software. Ruby, Perl and Python use it any time they have to compile a native driver, which could occur any time you add a module to a language.Can you give us more information about your system? Mac OS X version, Quicksilver version, where you downloaded it?When I need more screen real estate I set up a couple Screens and bounce between them. My Mac Pro at work has two monitors on it, and I have four workspaces set up, and am jumping back and forth all the time.I have shot photography professionally for many years, and bought glossy screen MacBook Pros for our editing. The color of the glossy is much more saturated without the matte finish. The downside is you can get a glare if you have a strong light behind you, but most of the time that can be fixed by turning the computer a bit.Agreed, though on the grounds that I don't use either Facebook or Twitter, so the value of Ping is completely lost on me.I have the same problem on a regular basis. Jailbreak, install SBSettings, and you can manage your own memory, with a task manager and everything. Way easier and faster then rebooting, and SBSettings is very useful outside of app management as well. You can also add the current free memory to the bar at the head of the window so you can tell what the device is doing.If you;re not attached to iPhoto, Lightroom is excellent. Also, Picasa supports a few raw formats, it may work, and is free.I was just curious about that large number, that all :)Yeah, but not like this. This is instantaneous and it doesn't take over your screen like the Expose view you get when holding a click on the app. HyperDock shows you the windows from all spaces, unlike Expose. Plus there are a whole slew of other useful things I haven't mentioned.Nice suggestions everyone. It'll be a while before I can pick a "winner" as I'll have to try the apps before I decide.OS X 10.6.5, Quicksilver ?54 (3815) [from 'About Quicksilver' dialog box]. I am not sure where I downloaded it, but I did it nearly 11 months back.Pretty sure Apple stopped including those cloths when they switched to the oleophobic coating. My 3GS didn't come with one, though I don't offhand know if the 4s include them or not.Extra info - Licence is personal so you can use it on more than one computer. iPad and iPhone apps purchased separately, for now only one computer can sync with the iPad/iPhone version.@Martin: knowing is half the battle!Thanks, that is perfect.  Not sure how I missed that.+ 1 Awesome and funny trick. I like it !since adalarasan hasn't clarified the question at all, I think this should be closedThis app is pretty slick, thanks for posting itI suggest the wired version, as the wireless's tracking is sub-par.It is not true. The behavior of OS X remains the same, regardless wether I make a network private or public: If OS X has been elected as Domain Master, then I will see all my Windows 7 machines. When OS X is not, I cannot see the Widows 7 machines.Maybe something changes on the windows client side - that is not my concern. I just want to see who uses my network, in any case. And that is what is no longer reliable.@glenneroo: of course.  we can't force you to close your own question.  on the other hand, voters or a mod might do so :PI think thou dost protest too much.OK, I've edited your question to make that clearer and I'm reopeningI love you @chiggsy.  you're just as paranoid as I am :)Terrrific. I also discovered that I could do what I needed using the UI - after years with OS X I just discovered today that searches will be particular to the icon one has selected in the sidebar.  Your method may help me in the future - I am using smart folders as a daily planner - I really like it - I can make file names containing several key words (tags) and then use pre-defined smart folders like SaDec25 for that particular day or LA_EVENTS for all appointments I might have in LA.  Working out real well.  Thank again, Allaneven I had downvoted it, but @dori solved the problem, so I removed my downvote :)  closing questions should be a last resort I think...ugh... that's the last thing I want - facebook invading something else that i use on a regular basis.Obviously opt out like ping. If you're not embracing face book and it's expansion then you're like one of this anti competitive freaks and you'll just get left behind making hand prints on cave walls. Let me guess you dont like google street view either :)is this a recursive question?You are right, I added some info in the question. It seems like more work then I previously suspected, but today's sunday, so I'll get cracking. ;)Downvoting allows to offer an opinion about a question, but a close vote can give the votes some context and offer the OP criticism upon which to alter the question to make it more suitable.actually i love google street view :)  facebook however is pushing our world right towards a george orwell nightmare.  but i don't think it will be a problem much longer.  someone is going to come along and kick the crap out of facebook much like they did to myspace.Can you post what you see in console related to Quicksilver? (`Applications -> Utilities -> Console.app`)Rebooting sounds less excessive than "jailbreaking".  :-)  And I have no games here, and no idea what app would be most memory-intensive.  Probably Safari, though that dies fairly frequently so you'd think it'd free up memory when it does.I don't doubt it.  This happens to me a lot.Thanks for toning down the harshness of the question. You'll get a better response as a result, and that benefits everyone here. I do care about the context of the question because I want to see this site succeed; having questions that contain unnecessary swear words and full paragraphs of near-argumentative, opinions doesn't help the community. Similarly asked questions get closed on other SE sites, and I don't see why this one should be any different. I have seen too many other good forums devolve into negative rant-fests over the years and I want to avoid that here. Every little bit helps.I have also removed my downvote as a result of the edit, but there is nothing I can do about my vote to close the question.One thing Things is desperately missing is proper cloud sync. (Current wifi sync is kinda ok, but it doesn't let you use Things on many computers, for example.) Cultured Code says [it's in the works](http://culturedcode.com/status/), but then they've said that for 1-2 years and nothing seems to be happening. :/ I've used Things for a long time and I like it a lot, but lack of this feature, and of [communication](http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/), makes me consider switching to Evernote or something.@Philip: I don't think anyone here is so immature as to find the word "crappy" offensive.What did you do?  Perhaps all of the items are hidden.  Click on an item, hit cmd+i, and see if the hidden checkbox is ticked.  If it is, just unhide everything.  Also make sure the folder you think is your desktop, actually is.  Your desktop folder is located at /Users/<you>/Desktop.  Maybe you created another folder elsewhere called Desktop and you're now confusing the two.Typically the choice is made by which one gives off the stronger signal.  There's no way to choose unless you create two separate wireless networks.  Actually I suppose you could dive into config files and give one priority based on its MAC address, but as far as I know that would be difficult and probably not worthwhile.  How many devices do you think can connect to an Extreme?  I've never seen an Extreme stop working due to too many connections.@Harry: That may be true in your social circles, but it may not be in others. We have to be careful in making such assumptions.@Harv is right - we have airport extremes that often get upward of 40 devices in everyday use with no problems at all.Yeah, iTunes is a synch tool.Cmd+O works too btw :-) (not really answer to your question, I know).+1... great answer.  maybe they could also change the name to iRecipes.I think this is better suited to stackoverflow.com.Thanks @mankoff! Smells great - once I've tested it and it works I'll mark the answer accepted. Much appreciated.I removed my current Quicksilver app (moved to trash) and downloaded new version and copied that to Applications --> Utilities. And when I try to launch the app, it's not opened successfully and may be some errors. Then I opened Console.app and searched for Quicksilver, then found this error --> Quicksilver[227] Prevented load of unidentified action from bundle Core Support.qsplugin because the action's featureLevel (set from its Info.plist) is higher than NSApp's current featureLevel. This is not neccessarily an error. Sometimes this mechanism is used to prevent unstable actions from loading.@Nivas - here it is... 12/12/10 8:35:27 PM Quicksilver[227] Prevented load of unidentified action from bundle Core Support.qsplugin because the action's featureLevel (set from its Info.plist) is higher than NSApp's current featureLevel. This is not neccessarily an error. Sometimes this mechanism is used to prevent unstable actions from loading.Thanks for introducing me to the ditto command.  Its man page lists all sorts of nifty features, including thinning Universal binaries and HFS meta-data information.Is it possible to change the Parallels configuration to use the logical (mounted) path instead of the disk#?Computers can always stealth themselves to other computers. If your end goal is to monitor computers connected to your network, you need to do that at your switch or router, not from another client computer. If you can't ping an IP address, does that mean a computer isn't connected at that address? (no; it might mean a computer is there but ignoring pings)So of course I have egg on my face, I missed the whole "batch files" thing. I suggest neither `mv`, nor `cp`, but `rsync` instead. Thilo, I'm very sorry. I had a one-large file use case in my head despite this thread regarding batches of files.As I mentioned, I have no idea. Try posting a comment on the Dev Team blog. You better be 200% sure of anything you do to your baseband, because changes to it are irreversible. I cannot stress enough how much of an unwise idea it is to casually poke around at baseband hacking.You should probably add that to your question then ;)That would probably only help in the event of hard drive problems, as I've heard similar suggestions for (temporary!) recovery of crashed hard drives. I doubt it would help at all for the newer flash-based devices.Try getting your hands on a display model at the store and fiddle with the settings? I'm waiting until I see an actual "iWatch" product myself.Not sure exactly what I did that changed it.  I've your two suggestions any they both were fine.  I also can't drop items on the desktop to put them in the folder - they just move back to the finder.stackoverflow ?Looks like you are running a old build (as you have guessed). Try to remove all app related files (including preferences) and reinstall.But the birthdate for the contacts doesn't match what is being shown in the calendar...?I don't have a Mac, so I don't use iCal...I would also add make the "Delete" key delete the selected item in finder.Hey Harry (and Fake Name), check out HyperDock, it brings the multi-window display you're looking for. That or the four-finger swipe down that makes Expose show all of the windows for the app.That sounds sweet, I'll check it out. Thanks!We're a mac shop, so the NetBoot setup is really handy because I can Net Boot any mac here to do maintenance on the boot drives. Also, if there's a problem with anyone's OS, they can Net Boot and have a working environment instantly. It was a pain to set up initially, but is really, really useful.its a great tool. We used to use this more than 'mv' when moving stuff between machines/servers/local drives or even on the main drive.True, of course, for a true network. I am using the router now, after I have a decent one with DD-WRT. But this is a family network, and my wife wants to see if our son is online. Teaching her to control the router is overkill. The problem itself was not solved, but circumvented. It works as expected with one OS X Server. All issues that I had are gone. What the reason was - I don't know.@tshauck: are you using path finder by chance?@calavera I actually was at one point, dl'ed the trial version, but didn't think I needed it.@tshauck: there is an option in path finder to hide finder's desktop and replace it with a version provided by path finder.  I'm not sure if it could be causing your problem if path finder is not running.  However, you might want to try reinstalling it and checking its preferences, particularly the general preferences section.I realize that auto login might be disabled at some point. Would this method work then?Any advice what might be in that script?I think it can be a simple script (make sure to chmod +x it), with a one-liner that runs DropBox.  I'm really not sure, but I would try 'open /Applications/Dropbox.app/' or what have you.This was actually the root cause of my problem, I was using RVM. But had not set the appropriate version of ruby in my session. Still learning...Use `rvm use 1.9.2 --default` to set a particular version of Ruby as your default. Of course you'll want to substitute the version of Ruby you favor if it's different than 1.9.2.For a cross-volume multi-file move executed as a copy - delete, is (cp ? rsync) followed by rm equivalent to a GUI copy followed by a GUI trash followed by a GUI empty-trash?Jonathan: As long as these cave walls don't have Farmville and Mafiawars, that sounds like a dramatic improvement.It normally switches back to wifi (a far amount of the usage occured while I was at home and I should have expected to be using the home wifi). Does an open connection switch to a new source? E.g. if an app is consuming 3G, but then the unit detects a wifi connection, does the app switch away from 3G?Switching is done entirely at the OS level; apps don't care how they get data just as long as they have a connection.It seems my question was not clear. As long as I close the browser using Command+Quit, my tabs seem to be maintained. Thanks for the answer though...there could be a timezone or date format mismatchInstalled both Perian and Divx for Mac, but still not able to import movies.No. Without a logged user, you cannot coerce Dropbox to work with it's current design. Period.This won't work because it will present the login screen for the app if it's not already configured/saved permanently. If, per my answer, you configure/save it for everyone, then it will work (but at that point, it will likely be logging in automatically anyways).Oh snap, how could I have forgotten that garageband DOES have this feature? Thanks for the reminder!@calavera Hey, thanks that did the trick.  If you'd like to post that in the answer section I'll give you some rep, if not thanks anyways.Rats. What version of iMovie are you using?@tshauck: awesome, I'm glad that did it!After some desperate Googling I was about to come to the same conclusion; especially one Slashdot article: http://it.slashdot.org/story/09/08/01/1658258/Apple-Keyboard-Firmware-Hack-Demonstrated made me think it might be coded to the firmware flash. BUT THEN I booted to my bootcamp/windows7 partition and the caps lock key works in a regular manner. So it seems the functionality is in the driver rather than in the keyboard itself. (On W7 the keyboard driver is standard HID Keyboard device -type, provided by Microsoft)That worked well. But it's not what i was looking for so... choosing this one just because it actually solve the problem until you get tired waiting 10 minutes for a video to be converted.Yep, that works! Unfortunately I discovered that the reimport feature is only triggered if the title/artist/album match exactly.  Since preserving my metadata was the whole point of re-importing, I now need to rethink the entire approach.  But you answered this question, thanks!I **Never** saw my system fall to less than 100 MB free, even when I was loading it as much as possible. This seems a bit odd to me.Python, primarily. Doing some heavy recursive computation.Also, batch image processingI've been using a Mac for years now...never heard of NeoOffice till now. After reviewing their website, I would say the software is just buggy. Obviously it's not a lack of hardware. Why not try OpenOffice instead? I'm downloading and installing OpenOffice now and will comment back here with any info. I'm not going to install NeoOffice though...seems iffy to me.I noticed some very slight lag in OpenOffice (maybe around 1/8 of a second) *some* times. Most of the time, there was no perceivable lag. I just tried a text document. Are you having issues with OpenOffice?@Dori - [van Dyke] and [von Buren] will sort differently depending on the users' preferences.  Addressing these programs programmatically is the problem of Collation. See the Wikipedia article on Collation here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation#Name.2Fsurname_ordering.  See in that article under Alphabetical order the example of McKinley and Mackintosh.  The OP mentions "you want to ignore the small words when sorting," and this is precisely a problem of collation as it applies to a locale.  See http://goo.gl/16jrQ.Thank you. That's it. You wouldn't happen to also know how to convert the path it passes `Macintosh HD:Users:Matthew:Documents:Programming:Apple Scripts:` to a path like `Macintosh\ HD/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple\ Scripts`?Caffeine does what the user requested, but I would suggest that the question was incomplete. When in presentation mode, you also want to make sure to either shut down the network, or shut down certain apps that use the network. You don't want an IM popping up mid-presentation...@matthewpavkov: unfortunately no... but there might be a command line utility.  feel free to create another question, I'm sure someone around here knows :PThanks again!true sometimes, but when your presentation uses the network, that can be problematic :)It's only paranoia if they are not actually out to get you ;)I would do what we did then - update the netboot image on major point releases.  It basically takes a day, but most of it is waiting so you can do other things while the image is recreated and updated, then you also have the last point release that you know has been working for a while.@Ben The MacBook line has never used mini-VGA. That died out with the iBook line. The first non-Pro MacBooks came with mini-DVI,  switching over to Mini DisplayPort with the introduction of the unibody redesign. The first MacBook Pros used a full-sized DVI port until the unibody redesign, when they, too, switched to Mini DisplayPort.Yes...I found that out the hard way. Good info!When you buy a movie on iTunes, is there any difference if you buy it via an AppleTV or not?Oh, sorry - I didn't realise there was that difference between the models. All I can suggest now is that it's a problem with the cable or, as you say, some kind of problem with the switch itself. How strange. :-(In this view-mode http://www.python.org/images/terminal-in-finder.png i find Finder ok-ish. I only miss cut/paste. The advanced stuff i do in the Terminal.appI use the web Google Reader on my iPhone daily and i am not missing much, up to now. What are the main advantages of an app?I like Path Finder, but it's not free :-(+1 for the artistic skill in the included background image :)Are you willing to consider options that become available after jailbreaking?Yes, jailbreaking is not a problem. If there's some Cydia app that lets me see the iPhone's native file system as a normal USB disk, I'll take it!Yes, pics contain EXIF and my importer can deal with that ... but videos don't, and they end up separated from the pics :'-( Also, using iFunBox is a pain for a task that should be so simple. I'm wondering if user *Chops* can come up with a JB app that's smarter than I am....and for cars.Didn't know about Prey; thanks for mentioning it. Their tagline "Silent but deadly" sure is attention-getting!+1 I do that ALL the time (i.e., hit caps lock, though it seems to activate it anyway). Good question.+1 for testing and reporting.I didn't know about this app. Still seems far from "one-click", but if it can ZIP all the pics&vids **and remove them from the phone** then it would be a good interim solution. I'll try it out.The "disk mode" is irrelevant; I don't want to use the phone as a storage device, I want to *read* from it's native file system. The photo feature seems to offer exactly what iFunBox does, but less. I've already jailbroken, and don't care about warranty (things are different outside the States). I did mention I'm on PC, meaning Windows 7 to be exact, sorry if this wasn't too clear - I think Mac users refer to their machines as "my Mac" rather than "my pc".that's like using a sledge hammer to hang a picture on a wall.@Epaga, I disagree. Nifle asked for "a productivity/workflow tool," rather than for a simple tasks list. OmniFocus is a productivity tool which *certainly may* be overkill for their needs, but that's for them to decide. OmniFocus sells themselves even for accomplishing household tasks (based on their "contexts").Probably not. Is there a way to find it out in iTunes?Thanks for the recommendation! Seems to fit my needs pretty well, as I already use Dropbox and often use plain text files for notes. Now I just need to do some Dropbox reorganising to make my stuff show up in this app...I'm non native English speaker, so it helps me to understand the spoken text better if i can read it as well. That's what I need it for.The `/` at the beginning of the path is the boot volume. Other hard drives are under `/Volumes/`Tried it with limited success: It only supports photos, not videos, and the "ZIP download" requires me to manually check a box for each relevant photo - so I'd have to click 214 checkboxes and still miss the videos. And it will only COPY the pics, not MOVE them (and there's no way to mass-delete them from the phone). Still, thanks for the suggestion!Well, it's the built in microphone in the iMac, as I sayed I installed the drivers from the Snow Leopard DVD, and I updated my bootcamp to the latest release, 2.0. Windows recognizes the device but doesn't works :\probably too late (should have posted this at the time), but see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1512/macbook-pro-memory for more general tips on memory compatibility.So, you go to a website, say reddit.com, click a link on that site and go elsewhere, then click back, and you see an old/cached version of reddit.com?@matthewpakov clarified question.I will give your advices a try, thanksAre you sure it actually uses the GPS? I'm pretty sure it uses Cell Tower triangulation only. The changes between updates shift significant both in the foreground and the background, and is too unreliable to actually be GPS.The issue isn't how many devices connect to the extreme, it's how many connect to the express. More than about 10 and it is unstable.@Martin, Nothing wrong with prey, just reached the limit of the freemium and wondering what else exist. And curious if I could learn from scripts how to achieve similar functionalities.It does work for video I believe - but yes as you mentioned it won't remove them from the phone.  Built in "Image Capture" app does this in OS X, but that doesn't help you're on a PC :)I like this solution! I don't think it's a misure. Also, works for me in iOS (chinese names, to be specific)Indeed - so you'll either need a powered mic or some other level converter@drfrogslpat: nice one! i never noticed that text before either...@Thomas L Holaday: Well, a GUI empty-trash could permanently delete all kinds of unrelated stuff already in the trash bin. I think there is a way to delete from the GUI bypassing the trash bin, maybe some option key combination, I can never remember those. That would be a good new question.And there went the bounty... ;_;Wrapping those command lines in `` would greatly improve readability.Are there letterbox settings on the TV itself? Apple TV can output 480p which should be (but not necessarily be) a 4:3 ratio. Can you set the output setting on your Apple TV?You can read how to change the output (select a video mode) in the manual which you can download. Then read page 30. ( http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=answerlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmanuals.info.apple.com%2Fen_US%2FAppleTV_SetupGuide.pdf&answerid=16777216&src=support_site.home.search )+1 for ~/Applications. Note that even if you have other user accounts, with the default permissions they can also still launch applications from there (no need to have three copies of Firefox for three user accounts).Does not directly address your question (only explains why page out can be much higher than swap), but the two numbers are not comparable, Swap is a snapshot (the current amount), Page outs is cumulative (page the same page out five times and it gets counted five times)Yeah Evernote isn't quite what I had in mind either.  Something a little more along the lines of Freemind/FreePlane or the old Bonzi for Palm OS.@torbengb - Ha, thanks! Unfortunately, that's the limit of my artistic skill...;-)It doesn't seem to work from me here with Snow Leopard, but it's clearly a step in the right direction.The Adobe Creative Suite stuff won't put up with being moved, insisting at every launch that it repair the problem. A couple of Adobe apps won't even run if moved.i agree that it's a good recommendation since it's one of the standard programs out there. and i also agree it's ridiculously overpriced. ;)+1 on Spotlight. Other than those applications I keep in the dock (and even them most of the time), I launch everything by a quick command-space to get to spotlight, then type the start of the name, and hit enter.Just installed and tried LibreOffice. It works pretty well, thanks!Tried that. Got the same thing, a 169.254.x.x address and no actual network connectivity.@VxJasonxV I got some hits in my test app that were within 10 meters. I believe that kind of resolution is only available via GPS. I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work to hard to get a GPS lock--you might be inside and out of the running for a good GPS fix.Thanks for the links, I'll give them a shot!Not free either, but I also recommend Total Finder: http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/. It is a Finder plugin, rather than a standalone program like PathFinder (and it's very lightweight compared to it). Mainly it adds tabs, dual pane view and cut and paste.thanks for the info, I was just curious. It seems like a nice service for an Open Source app.It's supposed to.  I just tested mine and it does.  Maybe you're not waiting long enough for the sensor to do its work.  Or there's a piece of software that's hooking in and doing something else with that signal.@koiyu check this: http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/rentzsch.com/notes/applesantiCAPSLOCK and look at the comments, some people have reported the same delay with Linux. Maybe the Win driver is different? Weird.Will this add the iPad as a third screen in a setup which already has an iMac and an external monitor?Ok, *your* app uses GPS, part of CoreLocation. But... does Google's?Oh. Well, I don't know. You can specify the desired horizontal accuracy, so I guess if you asked to be within a kilometer, it might quit before even getting into actual GPS business...I might try FlickTunes, I can't quite tell if it does what I want but it might be worth it just for the Song Title Scrolling functionality.I already have TuneWiki, it doesn't appear to show the song metadata but is great for lyrics.That's not an option sorry as we need to deploy ~300 machines with such a touch screen.as in my update, allowing the battery to run out and charging again fixed, although powering off did not. Thanks for your help.Spelling, grammar, less special characters, and maybe even a newline or two. Please? Also, what the heck is jawa?I told everyone that they have no room to complain when 4.0 came out. I used the 4.0 betas (part of the developer program) for nearly the first half of the year on my 3G. It was *miserable*. I really like 4.0, but I think that's because each beta was better than the last, so I got the opposite effect. Good -> Horrible -> Better.Ctrl+F3 focuses the dock (and shows it if it's autohidden)And with the cost of certain tools like MonoTouch, the licensing almost costs as much as this.@Jason: they're those little people in robes that sell droids on the black market.@Nate: I think matthepavkov has your answer, but also check out KeyRemap4MacBook for it's vi modes.I like this paradigm shift. I've gotten used to opening the "Applications" folder on my dock to run something -- it was there by default. But just now, I've dragged it off my dock and I will be making myself do this. I already have some frequently-used apps on the dock, but probably not enough; and I have used spotlight occasionally but definitely not enough.It also turns out that Mac OS will prompt you with a little popup when a mounted volume is no longer available.  There is a button that says "unmount all", but that doesn't seem to unmount all my /net mounts.  So if I mount 6 things under /net at work, then when I resume my system at home I get prompted 6 times with a few minutes in between.  It's very frustrating.  It would be ideal if they all showed up in finder, so I could just pull up finder and click to eject all of them at once.it didn't the task that prosseeek want, you just create another shell script for execute one specific file, but I think he want a general solution.Did that. The download keeps coming back.@Jonik: It's just designed much better and easier to read tweets. You can click links without having to click the tweet and loading it first. Plus on the trending topics you can see explanations, which I like.Meh, Echofon is much better.@am1rr3za: agreed, but like i said I haven't used mono much so I don't know if there's a way to compile your executable so that you can run it directly on the command line.  At least in the windows world, the OS knows how to identify a .net binary and load the .net CLR to interpret the MSIL.  I don't know how that would work on Unix, unless the binary was compiled to machine language.  But in .net, there has to be a runtime (I don't think you can directly execute a java app either).maybe someone else knows how to configure the system for direct execution, but this might be a question for stackoverflow.Do you keep WiFi/Bluetooth on while playing?great question...+agreed, I've done this with flash drivesIt depends on how awesome the game is.I really like your very detailed and explanatory answers.to maximize on time, i would turn on airplane mode, which turns off the radios, etc..Wow, so OS X really does listen for the filename! Not fantastic design in my mind, but interesting.+1 for rEFIt, that's the way to go.Yup, it sure does. Actually I believe what it does is rescans that folder every 20 seconds, converts all filenames to phonetic representations, and adds those to the list of commands it knows about. Personally, I think it's a great design -- nice and simple for the end user!I don't know this for sure, but the "super-admin" (meaning the first to register) should be able to define team members, and make other people an "Agent", which allows this individual to access iTunes Connect, submit apps, set up new provisioning profiles, and I believe also add new accounts as well, etc.Thanks Josh, holding 'D' has no affect and with no network, there is no way to do it remotely.@kim3er: Did you see the other options in that article? Do you have  access to a MacBook Air SuperDrive (or other external USB optical drive)?No, but I've got an appointment at the genius bar tomorrow. It's feeling like a RAM issue to me.Sorry Rich, I only now saw the part of your question where you mentioned you were unable to run AHT. This is the issue of having a system without built in ethernet and optical drives! I'll see if I can figure out another solution for you...I added a couple of suggestions to my answer. If those don't work and accepting the download doesn't work then the only thing I can think of isn an iTunes wipe (after backing up all of the iTunes content) and reinstall.sounds like bundling or the macpac would be the way to go, unless he just wants something really simple.don't take this the wrong way, but isn't this kind of redundant?  It replaces the call to mono with a call to the script, but either way you still have to type in the app name... so you replace `$ mono someapp.exe` with `   $ callmono.sh someapp.exe`.  just saying :PThat sounds more like a RAM usage problem than a CPU problem. I've had something like git use tons of CPU without lagging the UI, but when something starts eating up all the RAM then the UI takes a major hit. What's your RAM usage like during these processes?@Jawa, no WIFI/Bluetooth@mipadi, do you think Angry Birds is awesome enough to warrant such a short battery time?A much simpler solution (to wiping iTunes, +1 for your answer above which is detailed and good) is just to let the thing download and then delete it, assuming you're on broadband.@Ngu Soon Hui: I've never played it, actually.Thank you! This sounds like what I had expected. Not sure why my machine is always different. Just my luck. I may need to reinstall the whole **** machine and see if that helps.@mat Thanks, I'll try that.@msa I thought of it too. That'll be my last resort.Also, most games use the non-ringer volume control, but some do use the ringer volume for some reason.... but you still need a real Mac to submit the app to Apple ...Just mentioned this to a colleague and he wondered if you'd noticed the power light doing anything when you switch the monitor on from cold? Apparently the Cinema Displays will briefly flash the power light as a diagnostic if there is an internal problem, and this might be something you hadn't noticed. I expect there is a doc on the Apple website about the meaning of the different flashes (etc).I love this one ! :-Pthanks - this is close to what I wanted, except that the "switch between spaces" option doesn't appear on that list.There can be many admins on a team, but only one team agent.  And unfortunately, only the team agent can create new app IDs. See https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/help.action?programType=iphone@calavera - KeyRemap4MacBook allowed me to accomplish the feat. Under Vi Mode I selected the option for Command_L+hjkl, which magically works in tandem with the standard modifier from before. I wish there were a native way to do this, but this does the trick. Thanks!I was just supporting Java ;-)Actually a good tip, but not voting up due to the unnecessary and unhelpful commentary :-(.great, once again the awesome keyremap4macbook saves the day :P  i switched my comment to an answer.indeed... EPIC WINthat's true, if mono isn't in your `$PATH` this would allow you to call it without the absolute path in front.could you include some recommendations based on that link in the text of your answer?  link rot is always a problem over time, but if you put it here and just reference your source, it will remain useful in the future.I depends how intense the game is. 3D games (Modern Warfare 2) take alot more power than angry birds does (2D).I have a scenario here, not sure it would be a new question or not ? How can I prioritize the Wi-Fi (WAP) hotspots/ Base stations in iPhone or iPad ? i.e. as of now I connected to 2 - 3 wireless access points, but now I want to connect to only 1 WAP ? When I change it to the new one, but the iPhone keep going back to old one when it wakes up. Simply to put the order of connectivity ? I know how to do this on MBP but not sure on iPhone ! I can post this as new Q, if not duplicate.The same scent? Like bug-musk!?Will Disk Warrior scan the disk to detect for errors first?  I'm not even certain that the disk is defective..just trying to be preemptiveI've seen this being done at a couple of places but for some reason I've always dismissed it as it seems awkward somehow. I realize it's time to think twice about that since it would be very nice to have it mounted. I'll check this out.Any particular that you recommend more than the others?If you really like the Win environment, and you're not doing Mac-specific languages, why not use Win on the Mac? You could boot a VM, go to the integrated view (Win windows part of the Mac OS). Your working folder can be a native OS X folder (mounted in the Win VM).I don't use any of them. I do use aFloat and have windows go transparent when not in use.Is it safe to Rebuild directories and/or Check Files/Folders even if the drive doesn't appear to have any issues?Yes on both counts - it's safe to run on a healthy drive.Amen to learning and using the CLI.And another AppleScript + ruby starting point: http://mkdynamic.wordpress.com/2007/11/10/apple-address-book-cleaner-%E2%80%93-applescript/Based on the lack of reply, maybe you should take a different approach. What is wrong with installing 300 drivers?@Phil: i use shiftit but i'm just working on a laptop screen so i don't have a lot of requirements in this type of application.Just found a new site which lists a few more... http://alternativeto.net/software/shiftit/Because I kind of like Mac OS on my macbook. It's a nice laptop OS to me. Windows is more of a desktop system (mostly because I'm conditioned to believe so after many years of working with several screens and heavy duty processors) to me.Oh, and I'd like to do more programming on the fly and I don't like the concept of using two OSes on my laptop. Of course, if I don't find a good enough solution this will probably be my worst case solution.Nice story. Is the learning curve less steep than commonly perceived then? I only get frustrated with VIM so I end up using nano whenever I'm on a linux box without gnome/kde/whatever. I like your approach, personally I value my personal "growth" as a developer very highly and thus I'd like to try your approach as well.This is awesome. Thanks.what about Reverse tethering? I want to connect to my HTC Touch's GPRS connection using IPOD touch?Thanks for all your help, turned out to be a dodgy HDD, Apple Store are replacing it for me.Glad they were able to fix it for you!@Phil: I wouldn't really say it's easy to learn.  Depending on your situation, my advice would be to do something like what @mankoff suggested in the comments, and combine that with learning the new tools for fun.  I didn't just drop my windows environment and start using vim for everything right away.  It's a baby steps kind of thing.. started out by remoting into my Windows machine to do my professional work, while gradually learning vim, python, bash, etc on my macbook for my own personal projects.@Phil:  It's been about 6 months, and only recently (last week) did I make the switch to vim in my Windows environment.  Strangely enough, I had finally hit a point where using notepad++ and the like felt 'wrong', just as vim had felt weird before.  That's when you know it's time to make the switch :)  I guess the main point is to take it slow and not try to rush yourself.  You'll be more likely to keep on with it if you don't expect yourself to know everything all at once, and you don't stress yourself out by forcing yourself to use tools you aren't yet comfortable with for important projectsthis is one of the best subjective questions we've had on the site so far in my opinion.@Phil: one specific suggestion... get and use MacPorts for installing and maintaining all of your tools.  And try to document any installations you make of tools and the like when not using macports... you'll thank me later when you can't remember why a particular binary is in /usr/bin and you don't remember installing it, but would like to upgrade it using MacPorts or another package manager :)gfxCardStatus is super useful. Thanks @Ricket!Yes, I mean fast user switching.  I am not running Skype deliberately in my primary account, but perhaps it is using some resource behind the scenes, doing a background login or some such.That was it!  My default email had been set to a web-mail's notifier.  Changing it to Mail made Acrobat happy.Thanks again for the help. Do you know if the query language for smartfolders can do a boolean <OR> ?  I would like a smartfolder that would include the files meeting a criteria OR a 2nd criteria.  Only <AND> seems possible in smartfolders but this won't get me to where I need to go.Why do you want to do it? I am honestly curious.@John Smith : A certain app that i have, has a button just a little bit too low for my mouse to reach. If I could hide the menu bar I could access the button.MacVim is a nice version of gvim, similar to vim on Windows or gvim on Linux. With a little bit of creative soft-linking you can use the MacVim version from the command-line replacing the stock vim, or by typing mvim open the MacVim app with files. The best thing is your editor is available at the command-line or with a windowed interface on all sorts of OSes. I spend hours ssh'ing into hosts at work using vim at the command-line. Sometimes I use the netscp vim plugin to open files from the hosts on my office Mac. It's all the same keypresses and plugins and color schemes.[Grace Hooper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) had the [same problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg) back in 1947.Thanks for the answer. What exactly would I add to .bash_profile? I added the new PATH line from the .profile I showed above, but to no effect.When I connect my iPhone, I don't get a new drive letter for it. Instead of `K:\DCIM\800AAAAA` I just get the very cryptic address `Computer\Torbens iPhone 4\Internal Storage\DCIM\800AAAAA` which my programs can't use. Maybe I should kill this question and instead ask, *How do I get Windows to assign a drive letter to my iPhone?*Thank you for the suggestion! DiskAid does what PhoneView and iFunBox also do; they grant access to the files *inside that program*. Like the others, DiskAid allows me to *copy* but not *move* the images; I have to delete the files manually afterwards. DiskAid is nicer-looking and easier to use than the free iFunBox but not enough for me to warrant the $10 license.In the terminal what does echo $PATH show?Well maybe the "solution" is to go back to Windows XP. That would solve a lot of other <strike>features</strike> "problems" too! Let's see if anyone else can provide Win7-specific information.Solved in the Apple store. Thanks!I would ask why not just rsync the original - I ask this as far as I understand rsync does not understand the hard link directories so that you will end up taking multiple copies of every file.this one is pretty good if you just can't get into macvim.What are "software links"?@calavera yes I find it before find macvim now I just use macVimThe problem with installing a 3rd party driver is that it is something else that we need to maintain. Say if OS X updates and suddenly the driver doesn't work anymore, we will have to fix it on 300 machines.... `pgrep backupd-helper`i think he means links to the pages for the apps you list.Oh. Those are called URLs. I'm sure he said the same to all the other responders who didn't put them in too.@calavera: Thanks for the edit. I hate it when documents on major websites are removed like that. I added a new link which is sadly less relevant, it doesn't specifically mention `cron` being deprecated :-(Do you mean with each successive backup that is performed, Time Machine will generate a backup with hard links to the original files that have been backed up already? I ask this because I'm not that familiar with Time Machine. If that is the case, then yes I'd copy the original. But I am pretty sure that rsync has an option that will cause it to ignore recreating hard links.I found a more elegant way! TIME_MACHINE_PID=$! wait $TIME_MACHINE_PIDnp... unfortunately Apple seems to do it a lot :/@torbengb I added a couple of suggestions that seem to solve the problem for most everyone.Don't know about the 4th gen (why would it not have a clock?), but the first gen shuffle (which did not have one) used the time that you sync'd with iTunes as an approximation. So if you sync'd daily it would at least have the date right.@VxJasonxV nice.  Thank you.It would not have a clock because a clock is a clock consumes battery, and with no user-visible interface to read the clock's time, set it for Daylight Savings vs Standard, etc. it is a rather rarified instrument.  I remember the earlier model Shuffles using synchronization time as Last Played, so I was surprised to see the 4G doing something more precise.  And unsung.My money is on it having a clock - computers just use them. Otherwise how would it know when to go to sleep / turn itself off / get started on dinner? I'd say it has a clock (like nearly every computer based device) that loosely syncs with iTunes. If it doesn't have a clock then I'm with Dori, it's got to have a timer of some description.I can run skype in my main admin login, and my guest login happily - but that's on 10.6.5 and the skype 5 beta - maybe upgrading to the skype beta would fix it?it's a bit confusing, as the man page for mv states: "The mv utility now supports HFS+ Finder and Extended Attributes and resource forks. The mv utility will no longer strip resource forks off of HFS files.  For an alternative method, refer to cp(1)."  so where is this spotlight information stored then?Thank you Matthew, will have a look and report back. It may take a few days *<|:o) Have a Satisfactory, Non-denominational Capitalist, Wintertime Gift-giving Season.If the address is found in contacts the corresponding contact would be shown (with all data). The email address used in that given email is highlightes in blue.Yes that is how TM works - rsync can understand hard file links but I don't think t understands hard directory links which are unique to OSX since 10,5Thanks. HootSuite isn't ideal -- I'm using the website -- but it definitely does schedule tweets, and you can use it for free in a limited way.Thanks, yeah I saw those links, but I cannot find iTunes 9This especially would be the case on Gmail - if you set it up using the Gmail icon on mail setup, it automatically sets Archive vs Delete.Also, more than just students get a discount. If you were for local/state/fed government or certain companies that work out deals with Apple, you get a discount as well.The exact sequence above ended up prepending the second video instead of appending it, but otherwise it worked perfectly!What does System Update do here - doesn't it find the newest iTunes that works?I believe that is only when looking at an existing message - not when you are in the compose function, which is the basis of my question.  ThanksYou have to use `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin`. `export` puts it into the environment.So it does! Thanks!Steps 1 and 2 already done no response ...i think i have to go for step 3 a restore@Martin, well, I'm using a `MAAttachedWindow` but it sets the origin of the window's frame to (500,500).I probably get weirdest question of the year award for this one :-)what exactly does Disk Repair say is broken?sorry when I say new I really mean in good shape... I'll change the question to better reflect the prob.That may be more likely, but again you'll have to jailbreak the device at the very least. There's a lot more information about simple tethering to share a GPRS/Edge/3G connection out there, but all require jailbreaking as a first step. The only other option would be if you can configure your HTC Touch to become a Wifi basestation for tethering purposes. I'm sure this is possible. The iPod touch would then connect using either bluetooth or Wifi, but that would shift the emphasis to the HTC Touch needing a change, which could make it much easier.So, assuming you could get the G5 to recognise the caller id and only respond based on that, what would you then expect the G5 to do? Answer the call and route it out to the alarm system?Are you looking for something more specifically focused than eBay? That's normally where I start looking.The MagSafe connector is for charging, it's nothing to do with sharing screens. The cable needed for the 27-inch iMac is Mini-DisplayPort cable. Usually you'll get an adapter for this into whatever video connect is available on your MacBook, which varies a lot model to model. Apple typically sells a good range of these adapters."MagSafe" is associated with the Apple power cables, none of the video cables.  The Apple LED Cinema Display has a split cable coming out of it with Mini DisplayPort and MagSafe.@Chops - Yes, more specific than eBay please.Yeah, it's Mini Display port. I thought it's part of Magsafe connector cable, for both charging and connecting display b/n iMac and MacBook.Nah, totally separate. They're just bundled together for neatness-sake in the latest Apple Display.What country are you from? Anything more focused than eBay is usually relatively region-specific.@Chops that's what I meant to say. If he buys this single cable, he can power his MacBook and also connect it to iMac.@Chops - USA, but then it's "too specific for StackExchange".@garikapati Yeah, fair enough, easy mistake to make. I think the only issue is that there isn't a cable you can buy like that. It comes as part of the new Apple Cinema Display built in. If you were to go into an Apple store and ask for a Magsafe cable, they'd sell you a charge for a laptop, which obviously isn't what's needed. I'm not aware of an integrated Magsafe, Mini-Display Port, USB combined cable that is sold as an individual item.I think of the Shuffle as being the intellectual peer of a coral polyp.  I am imagining experiments where I synch, play a song, change the date on the Mac to 2024, then synch again to see what it reports.yes, they are exact duplicates. I did open the iPhoto Library via show package contents, I see a new folder is created with '_2' appended to the original Event folder name. I am guessing if I delete the new folder duplicates will go. Let me know.@Chops, what I was hoping to do was to disable the line pass-through of the modem unless the caller ID matches a given number... but it may very well be impossible.I'm going to mark this answer as accepted, even though I had to download it -twice-.Huh, there's an app I'd never heard of before. Awesome. +1 for unintentional discovery.Not really an answer for the question you asked, but I've found it's quicker to add clips to iMovie by opening the iMovie project bundle and dragging the clip into the `Media` folder. When next opened, the clip is in the library and can be used, no waiting.@garikapati - I would; close iPhoto, move the folders with _2 outside of the iPhoto Library, and then rebuild the iPhoto Library.  Do this by holding cmd+opt while launching iPhoto.  It will rebuild the database and should get rid of any anomalies that can be introduced by simply moving those folders away when iPhoto isn't expecting you to.  Let me know if that doesn't fix your problem.  This article may be relevant to you: http://cdevroe.com/notes/iphoto-salbum-dupes/The current crop of iPod touches don't support an inbuilt receiver (although they physically have all the necessary chipsets to do that, it's been disabled by Apple).

As @tonklon correctly answered, that's less than a third of a single frame at 60fps.I've dropped mine much farther onto asphalt, smashed it with a 30-lb chunk of ceramic, and dropped it onto carpets, desks, linoleum, and many other surfaces dozens of times (yes, I have butter fingers). Other than breaking the glass once (with the chunk of ceramic) it's worked flawlessly. Replaced the glass myself and it's very nearly as good as new. +1 for checking it thoroughly, but it's very durable, I wouldn't sweat it.all the 3 steps failed slide to unlock is not respondingThat happens with every application I install until I've confirmed I want to open it.  Sometimes it takes one, sometimes two times of opening the app before the real icon shows up.@paranjai then your only bet is to wait until the battery dries out, only then, you can re-charge it and restart it.@gamma I've had no problems adding custom icons to apps before. Have you tried logging out and back in? Have you tried restarting? Is this what the relevant lines in your .plist look like: `<key>CFBundleIconFile</key><string>cc.icns</string>`?Thanks Dori, these screens look pretty good. We've actually written our own driver for a touch screen now, but if we don't use that then we will definitely check these out.@Dori: That's a very good point... dacracot could try to cherry-pick parts of `/Library` but this is very unlikely to work :-(yeah, there are shortcuts for selecting a specific space, but there are not shortcuts for switching between spaces.4.2 is releasedLooks like the drive has bad sectors, which I understand is a physical issue.  Any suggestions for getting the data off in the most comprehensive way?  I'm currently trying to image it using Drive Genius...@jlpp: Glad I could help! =)Hmm interesting. And, might I add, too late in my case... I guess I'll just hope for the best. I edited my question to cross out the gem update step.@calavera I think that is what I'm experiencing as well.
@matthewpavkov yeah, the line looks like mine. The question is how to avoid the logout/login/restart procedure.I couldn't find anything specific in that article about it being better than using package managers... what's the gist? :PI haven't used d/g but it should work. Get your critical files off first- bad sectors shouldn't indicate iminent doom but it's better to be safe than sorry!That Roambi looks neat. Do you have links to other similar apps?Very nice but also very pricey! If only I could afford one...Thanks for your answer - unfortunately enabling the mirror option didn't work. The TV is still disappearing from the Displays Preferences when it's turned on.Soon (Jan 6th at least in the US), the new Mac App store also opens, which would help with a lot of app updates that are bought through the store.You still couldn't play Hulu, unless Hulu incorporates this into their app.This should be made into community wiki rather than simply closed.@massimogentilini -- you will get back your investment in time spent not performing upkeep and maintenance on your NAS.unless it's business purpose, it's pricey ! For home users $400 - 500 is the ideal limit IMHO.Which Mac do you have ? I think you can change these key combination's via keyboard settings.@calavera that may turn into a flame-war between Gentoo LInux users trying to justify why they spend 30 hours compiling the last line of code of their *entire* OS and RedHat users telling them that they *simply use rpm*. :)My only gripe is that programs should depend on file content, not file name. However, what you said works and I was just making things too hard on myself (no compilation or anything necessary). Apparently, simple things confuse me!+1 Good explanation. As I come from Windows background, I do minimize all the time in OS X. But will start doing 'hide' and see how it goes. I use keyboard a lot in windows environment ( I still use Windows at workplace) but in OS X, I am lost on this. Could you please point me to keyboard shortcuts info (i.e. any link)+1 for Transmit, it's awesome.I know that Last.fm and LittleSnitch ate not `MenuExtras`, but provided by applications. COuld this be the reason?That makes sense.ok so never mond... Macfusion worked. Apparently, downloading with safari worked while downloading with firefox 4 beta 8 didn't@Garikapati There are a few: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343 is the official from apple, however I always liked this one: http://www.danrodney.com/mac/index.html and http://creativebits.org/keyboard_shortcuts_in_os_x (both come up in google fairly easy).Well I knew that, but in-context what is sind talking about?@Martin Appreciate that! Will check these links.@Ous: good stuff. MacFusion is pretty sweet. Can't be free even if the interface is a clunky. If you want a slicker interface Transmit will do what MacFusion does (plus a whole lot more) and look damn good doing it.cool. Checking it out now man. Thanks.whoa. That's some buggy software! I'll keep an eye on it, but for now it's unusable.The original/2G (edge)-only is different from the 3G and onwards, externally?Your apps don't 'disappear' when your license expires? Interesting. Never thought about that before.This seems like an odd question to ask. I could post the contents of `ls -d /Applications/*.app"` to answer it. Though I admit, the note about ruby is good food for thought.This is a very interesting point to think about. Can I upvote you like, 10 times?@VxJasonxV Yes, the recessed headphones jack is one of the exterior differences of the iPhone 2GIt's one of those things that a lot of people don't think about. You'll see a lot of people say to go ahead and update the system languages, but I've seen what it can do. Flakey, weird stuff happens that are really hard to explain or diagnose. So, now I just leave it alone and go mess around in my own RVM created sandbox. At a minimum I'd recommend installing from source into /usr/local/ or via one of the *port package managers. It just feels safer.I have 1Password on my Mac, my iPhone, and my iPad. Can't imagine life without it.I just loved HyperDock. Explanation was great (but again tough one for damn simple users ).Danish and Austrian iPhones are also SIM-locked. I think UK is one of the rare exceptions...what version of Mac OS X are you running? what programs are running?10.6.5 is the versionIt appears to be similar to my recommendation: basic file and folder access unless you jailbreak. Looks like another good option, though.Thats not quite the thing either, since I can't call it from the "Drag&Drop" routine which is done by a user - not me.
It has to be something that can be done from the ".app" folder or via the Info.plist.+1 Great answer, agreed. I got tired of not being able to unhide and unminimize stuff easily so switched to using Spaces. Took a bit to get used to it, but my productivity has really increased.Invisible windows in JavaScript? Never heard of that.Nope. Same issue for me. Plus, I've edited the question and I really wish to keep my address book the way it is. But what you say holds true when I'm trying to use most SIP phones.That's very good to know, and precisely my problem! Now we just need a solution for it. :PI like both, but I'm using mplayer more nowadays. It is great!you really should consider lastpass. I abandoned my keepassX.Just for completeness you might want to include your iPhone model and iOS version, just in case.Actually, I don't have one yet :-) But, if the answer to this question is Yes. Then, I probably consider the investment.Being able to retrieve photos you took with your iphone on any machine should be straight forward, even without jailbreaking. What you **can not do** *without a lot of tweaking* is retrieving pictures you upload to your iphone through iTunes.jailbreaking does not void any warranty as far as I can tell. It's a legal procedure just not really well seem by apple.@torbengb samething for me as for ipacheco. on windows I have tried with my iphone, it just works. try this: http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=6352553highly disagree with @ortwin given the answers below.I actually got used to not have everything maximized, unlike when I was a maximizor freak on windows, once I started using OSX. but nice app! :PIt would be awesome if not so buggy and heavy.Not surprised since its a new tech. I have not used it, just saw it in my RSS feeds the other day.I find it surprising dropbox comes up first... This would never happen with a "Windows Programs you can't live without" in a windows community.I always loved VLC... but try MPlayer guys. It's listed here already and it's awesome!Is there a way to "search prior to posting" through all pages at once? - nevermind just found a way: **searching on the question feed**!  :)@garikapati: The question isn't "what's the best NAS under $X" -- the DroboFS is still cheaper than "a Mac and some drives" and that one currently has more up votes.CyberDuck even supports Amazon S3 (cloud storage).There, I couldn't vote this answer up enough so I voted your others that I judge were just as good as this. :) - so sad this still doesn't answer the question!Thanks for your inputs! I'll need to spend some time on the home computer and try out your suggestions, and also check out the discussion Cawas mentioned, and an Apple support page: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538 I'll report back.this one looks very nice.I think thats the one...@Thilo I am still searching for other apps. CheersI don't use firefox, only Chrome.This is an issue w/o a browser open.I'm always a bit wary of jailbreaking. I would be more then willing to dedicate 1GB or so of disk space to contain a decent map cache of my general area so I don't need to be online as much.@Josh Jailbreaking isn't enough, there is then significant hacking. I've edited my answer to add some detail.As cool (and interesting) as it sounds, I think I'll pass on the latter. Would be worth it if I had more spare time.yes I have the original iPhone. Thanks for answer.More info on the jailbreak helping this, please? I could never find any app there to do it (other than 3rd parts that need to call a number).Do you use fluid.app? I've had strange expose-windows with that.OS X version is very, very relevant to all this due to how the new Snow Leopard Expose works. I prefer using the older, original one: http://superuser.com/questions/118424/old-leopard-expose-on-snow-leopard-for-macAnd it works with Original Expose! :D  Thanks for pointing HyperDock.Plus lastpass is free and just bought xmarks. The year plan for premium is cheaper than 1pass pro for iphone and provide a free app. But I have to admit, 1pass website looks way better! :Drelated: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5096/how-do-i-get-windows-to-assign-a-drive-letter-to-my-iphone@torbengb use @ to notify the person on comments. works just for the first one in each comment you add it. and you're welcome! ;)It is a thing, I programmed one for a website about three years ago but I forgot completely how to do it because of how archaic it is. I run into these on a regular basis, too with various online banking applications so please don't strikethrough my entire post until you've investigated the issue.That's good, a man after my own heart. Chrome FTW!Martin, how's that find my iphone trick again? "create everything"?Drive letter does appear on WinXP, but you won't be able to copy anything into the iphone, which is the real question @torbengb did here.I also looked for such a solution and never found one. There's even a jb app that will partition a FAT which will work fine as a thumbdrive, but that's still far from what we wanted. I just doubt there's anything out there yet.Lastpass is free if you only use it on one device. And yes, way cheaper in order to sync it across any/every device. 1Password does look better, but it works on par. I pay for pretty most of the time, but Lastpass just seems to work better for me. (I used 1Password before I used Lastpass.)You're right. I never looked at it this way. Thanks!Yes it does have assisted GPS but that shouldn't use any GPRS. Plus I think they want GPS working as it should without any data consumption.@Cawas @torbengb I certainly can copy photos on and off my iPhone and iPad using the drive letter assigned under XP. I actually do it once or twice a week, so I speak with complete authority.Matthew, then I'd love to know how you do it! Read my comment on the question... I never could do it. Specially not even on the mac! Is your iphone even jailbroken? Maybe that's a feature of iOS 4, since I never really tried it. - btw, actually on the mac I can browse the whole iphone usinh netatalk, a JB app. but never withough jailbreaking! :|The answer is: you can't. It isn't a problem with your phone, it is the way that mobile networks operate in Brazil. The SIM card was masking this in your previous operator. There are workarounds equivalent to TIM's approach that will edit your phonebook and add the carrier code for you, but I don't like software tampering with my entries. For example: http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/minha-operadora/id401640256?mt=8 or http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/ddd-facil/id381994693?mt=8@ipacheco From my point of view this is a problem my phone could and should fix even while it is usually "solved" in the SIM card. I keep my address book in sync and use it in other places, such as SIP phones. I really don't want to modify it - it is right the way it is. I just want the phone to do it right and I'm sure there's a way around it, which is sure getting hard to find!*By the way, on a side note*: only reason I noticed your edits or comment is because I was looking for them. You should use @cawas to notify me! ;)@cawas and thinking better I agree with you. In fact I now remember that before buying an iPhone I expected it had some kind of configuration like Windows has that allows you to configure what code to dial in advance of a phone number in order to reach a dialtone and make long distance calls. But the iPhone doesn't have those settings, and I don't recall seeing them anywhere in Mac OS X either. I guess the only solution for you would be an app that replaced the Phone app or at least the Address Book app.I had already done this -- all the Internet and MMS fields were filled with the obviously invalid value `xyzzy` but it would still connect about hourly for a few kilobytes. I'm starting to believe that an iPhone just isn't designed to be totally offline (which makes sort of sense, I admit).Yes, it's manual, and the network settings are intentionally garbled in order to stop it from working.Location services has been turned off the entire time, and no location-aware apps were ever started.I should've done that right from the start!! In fact I just did call them and instead of preventing data usage they just gave me 8 months of 1GB-per-month for free.... very odd, but it "solved" my problem :-)We don't have visual voicemail here. I did mess up the network settings, but to no avail. Odd.Wow, sorry, I thought I edited my own post. I rollbacked everything. Really sorry.Possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/731/is-an-iphone-call-recorder-theoretically-possible?I am talking about - adding new ones that aren't shipped by Apple.@sugar - that was already covered in my answer, so I edited it to make it more obvious.Oh ! That's great. :Dwhen you touch it incorrectly, does it protest?@torbengb well, if *that* didn't work my only guess is that it keeps sending data for **lost my iphone** being able to recover it. but it's still way to odd on how it would be able to send any data without knowing where to. how do you measure data is being transfered anyway?About your comment, clozach, for an app on apple store being able to do it, it could only be one that requires you to dial another number first. So it's not technically an iPhone call recorder.All answers here provide an app that needs either internet connection or calling another number first. To me, that means the actual recording is taking place in a central and not within iPhone. That's hopefully not what this question is about. I at least am expecting an app actually able to do it even without internet and specially with no need to call an international number back and forth.Really good service. But it *needs no jailbreaking anymore* and it is, just like every other "iphone recording app" out there, actually done within a call center the whole process, through an access number.Yes I meant "screen on". I just realized that the OS allows "never" as an autolock option without jailbreak, but the SBSettings will make it easy to just do this when I want, not all the time. I think I'll delete the question, as it is just part of the OS...@Cawas you have to create the account and configure it from an iPhone 4 (with the app Find My Iphone). So all the steps you have to perform as if you had an iPhone 4.Oh, that's a very interesting trick! Thanks for sharing it! :)What sort of monitor do you have, and what kind of cable connects it to the Mac?Out of all 40 apps listed here before my contribution, this is the only one I would include as "iphone app I can't live without".Measurements: 1) the Settings app tells you the mobile data consumption. This stated some 170kB sent and ditto received. 2) the provider monthly bill. This stated 14 MB for the same period! I have no idea whatsoever what data was sent or received, what app (or OS "feature") did it, or why.Kop, on your question you can embed the image within it. Just use this syntax: `![alt description](http://i.imgur.com/wsndr.png)`@Kop you could set up an american account with no credit card, and it will stay in english. Only down said is that you can't buy stuff this way. :P@torbengb Well, as for the monthly bill, that's very hard to know what it means for sure. You could only be sure it's iphone fault by leaving the SIM card on another phone for the whole month bill period. The settings, in other hand, in my end never move if I just use SBSettings to turn off 3G, cellular data and nothing else. So there is some odd behavior on your end indeed.@jbeigel: did you get iTunes Remote Control to work at all? I tried it to control my Apple TV from my Mac, but it asks me for a username/password, which prevents me from going any further.@Cawas @torbengb I have updated my answer to show how to do it in XP. Perhaps it will provide some insight for Windows 7 as well.Matthew you can't notify two people through `@`. @torbengb didn't get it because I did. Only first one will. And **damn** that was a hell of a clarification! You really didn't need to go that far, but thanks! It's pretty clear to me *you did nothing special and it sounds like default behavior now*. Which is even weirder because in my case it never ever worked that way, including with my previous unjailbroken iPhone 3G and same iOs 3.0.1 you pointed... Oh, **maybe it's all about iTunes**! I can't recall having it installed anywhere I've tried, and it sure got drivers (for tethering, I've tried)this is great and it works well!  I would mark it as the answer except I also want to know if there's a way to do this in the shell like you can on other *nix systems.Harv, put that comment in your answer, and I'll mark it as the correct answer.+1... sorry I haven't had a chance to mess with this yet but when I do I'll put some feedback on here.wasn't me but someone voted to close... I think if you just changed your question to be more specific about what you're trying to do it wouldn't get any 'subjective' votes.Why this question got downvoted? I really hate typical apple user behavior of too much "out of the box" thinking. Sometimes we just need a straight path even if it is not "optimal"!@Robert and how new users can make Community Wiki anyway? I don't see how I could in my case.I'm sure you know you can choose percentage AND battery icon from the drop-down menu. I think the reason behind the icon being there is it's a little less confusing than just seeing a percentage in the menu bar.That's funny because I had the EXACT same idea, and I started developing an app just like that, which doesn't have the bloated features of a full-fledged GPS app like MotionX GPS.The link you provided is dead.  Do you have an updated one?@AngryHacker Yeah sorry it was .org instead of .com. I already updated the post.tried that . .didn't help . .still says "No content"Which specific Steel Series headset is it? Is it USB? If not, what version of the MacBook Pro do you have (i.e. early/mid/late [year])i have an early 2009 macbook Pro... not quite sure :S

the headset is: Steel series siberia v2 and it does not use USBDo you have both a headphones and a microphone jack, or just one?This site says that there's no problem with creating the SOCKS proxy, but the setting must be set using PAC files. I was wodnerign if there was an easier way. http://snipplr.com/view/16563/how-to-connect-to-a-socks-proxy-from-an-unjailbroken-iphoneipod-touch/Of course, if you're running an OpenSSH server on Windows with Cygwin or something, then you can likely just skip the intermediate tunnel.Here is someone doing the inverse of this to do normal tethering: http://snipplr.com/view/16563/how-to-connect-to-a-socks-proxy-from-an-unjailbroken-iphoneipod-touch/Fortunately @torbengb got yours. :) And yeah, it may well be drivers installed as part of he iTunes installation.The desktop drive will need both 5V and 12VThanks for your answer. I am aware of the USB route, but I haven't been that impressed with the speed of current USB externals. The SATA connection would suffice, provided it works of course :-)The USB route depends on the drive speed, cable, and USB port (2.0, etc.). My USB external runs at about 22.5-45MB/sec, which is plenty fast for moving files around. The external USB item I linked before may just be a little uglier sitting on the desk.Thanks for the link - yeah I definitely don't want to fry the drive. I wasn't aware of a voltage difference - are there any adapters I could use?No idea. I think that thread had a bit of a discussion about that, but unfortunately, that's the most I know about the topic.Unfortunately the mid-2007 MacBooks have FW400 instead of FW800. Even so, the SATA inside my MacBook is 1.5Gbps so I'd like to use that if at all possible.The only thing I'd worry about is breaking something while you're in there. I've never opened my MBP up, but when I took it to an authorized service shop to get a 500gig put in, he accidentally tore the tiny sata ribbon cable and had to replace it. Plus, you'll have a nasty cable coming out of the machine, which might be a bad thing. Wish you luck though!@Cameron: Yeah, supposedly the old plastic MacBooks were comparatively among the easiest to upgrade the disk/RAM in Apple's lineup. I do wonder how I'll seat the cable, but the cable coming out of the machine doesn't bother me if I can get that extra capacity.I just tested my theory above. You cannot use AirTunes to play from one Mac to another.This looks like a bug. Do you see high numbers when the program is NOT marked "`Not Responding`"?Yeah, this was the only time I saw it. I actually went as high as 3,000% for a second, but the system was barely responsive so it was difficult to get a screenshot.Yeah, it's a 2-year-old MacBook - 1 processor, 2 cores. So... probably a bug.You can type about:plugins in the Safari address bar to get a list of installed browser plugins.@arathorn: I just get a blank page when I try to visit about:plugins. You sure that works for Safari?@Kyle Cronin: Whoops, my mistake. You actually just to to the *Help* menu and select *Installed Plug-ins*.Thanks for the tip - I've actually had CTF installed for a while. Could it be another plugin perhaps?It seems to be better, but I don't know if that was the update or the restart that did it. I'm going to accept this answer unless Safari starts acting up again.That's my current setup, but I hate the bulk at the end of the cable. I would much rather have a Mini-DVI to DVI cable with the adapter on the monitor end to convert to DVI, if such a cable exists.Hmm, If the specs allow it, you could make it, and if you could make it, someone in China would have already made it (I guess, they would have made it even if the specs do not allow).If it's not popular enough yet it will never be. Apple doesn't use mini-DVI anymore.This might work, but I cringe at trying to explain how to configure the router to forward ports to my grandmother. I'll put it in the list of things to try though, thanks :-). What does it mean if this does or doesn't work?iChat can be finicky sometimes... if this works, then you should be good. Alternatively, you might look into LogMeIn, as it's easier to set up for grandmother types, since it involves no portforwarding.@jtbandes: thanks for the suggestion of LogMeIn, if only so I can remote-control her computer long enough to set up the system preferences/port forwarding.I guess it's par for Apple's course to provide an unwanted "feature" that can't be disabled.+1 Learning something new is always worth a voteWow, that definitely looks promising, thanks! It says it's for iTunes 7.7, so I'm not sure if it'll work with iTunes 8, but I'll give it a go.FWIW, It works for me on iTunes 8.2.1.Sorry it took so long, only now was I able to test the script and I'm pleased to say that it works very well. Thanks!Kyle: If you have a backup of all your media (which i assume you do seeing you are syncing it), just try it anyway. It cannot hurt.I don't know if it was the "erase and sync" or the "manually manage music setting" but all the music is now gone from my iPhone.I think that DAAP works through the network, and I was hoping to connect through the cable. Besides, it looks like it requires a jailbroken iPhone.Thanks for your answer - sorry it's taken me a while to respond. I tried your suggestion the other day - iTunes successfully believed that it was the syncing computer for my iPhone; unfortunately, the lack of music and apps on the computer caused it to wipe them off my iPhone as well. :-/ I might give it another try in the future, but right now I can't figure out how to get it to leave my stuff on my device.Well, I think the point of this hack is that it suppresses the "Do you want to erase everything?" dialog box when you check the "Manually Manage Music and Movies" checkbox. Checking that box, combined with ensuring that "Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected" is NOT checked, means that you can plug in your iPhone and listen to the music on it, and it won't touch the files on it unless you manually press the "Sync" button. This is what I do: I use my computer at home to sync, and I play music through my work computer without ever syncing it.BTW, I can't remember for sure, but I think after I completed this hack it did automatically sync (and erase everything) the first time I plugged my iPhone into my work computer. But after I made sure that automatic sync was disabled, it hasn't done it since. Good luck!I just tried it and it works! Thanks for noticing and posting this!what conclusion you got in this subject?I really only turned it on when I installed the OS because this is a portable computer and I was worrying about my data being secure. I'm now looking into how to turn it off without messing up iTunes, iPhoto, etc (the libraries of which have untold GBs of music, photos, and movies).OK, the next time my Mac complains it's almost full, I'll run this and post the results.been using this for a while, and it's great, but didn't work on my current issue, as user29234 mentioned, because it couldn't scan my whole system.Thanks for the link - that's pretty much what I've been looking for, a list of potential suspects.Yes, I used it too. Works like a charm!Thanks for the tip on Monolingual! I do realize that shutting off Filevault is supposed to be as simple as unchecking the box; however, it requires substantial free space that I don't have at the moment (and may never have without doing potentially dangerous things like moving my iTunes and/or iPhoto libraries to an external disk).Not bad app at all. All 3 suggested in this question have their pros and cons. This is the simplest and non-graphical that will list and order your whole disk by file size.Btw, nice infinity effect ;-)Exactly what I needed! Thanks!Cool. I did not know that.Voting to close *without* commenting? Way to go, team!@Kyle not a big fan of accepting answers, huh? I wonder why.dougscripts follow moore's law - every 18 months they doubleyou should follow @adambox's idea and **use xmarks to sync chrome and safari on your mac**. as for xmarks being paid, I've never seem it. I got a free app on iphone that only works os a subscription.given the problematic on this issue, that's a very elegant solution!@Cawas I just had a bunch of my old questions migrated over from Super User, which apparently forgot the accepted answers@Kyle oh I see... a bug in the matrix.The link for page 'p7zip for Mac OS X' http://homepage.mac.com/krmathis/ returns with 404. Is it hosted somewhere else?I tried to add some gestures for QTPlayer and send random key or take "No Action". It didn't help :-( QTP still does execute its actions.iphone dev team is the most reputable source for jailbreaking indeed. but it's also one of the most confusing ones for reading. and being on 3GS doesn't mean it will be untethered.Good point, I revised to mention the insertion point.both... one for the microphone and one for the headsetThis application seems to be available only for jailbroken devices!I would say -1 - I have not looked at it, but being free would not be enough of a positive aspect. But at least it should be pointed out that this app requires jailbreaking, which currently is not possible on the 3GS and iPod touch 2nd and 3rd gen.(not possible with the most recent firmware, that is)And it's free too!currently costing ~$3.It has a custom PDF displaying engine which lets you zoom in for a 50X magnification!Indeed, its an awesome app. Impressed. Bought. And started using!And you missed to remark that is cost 5$.seriously? that seems really weird to me.oh.  I meant for a custom ringtone...Do non-custom ringtones play longer than 30 seconds?If they have the same name, then no, you cannot.iOS 4 is known to cause problems with 2nd gen iPhones and iPod Touches. You're gonna want to [restore it](http://lifehacker.com/5572003/how-to-downgrade-your-iphone-3g[s]-from-ios-4-to-ios-313).You can, actually. http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=10733@Sathya: Thanks, edited my answer accordingly.As Stephen noted, it's against the licensing terms. Last time I looked they allowed for some small images like they have next to directions, but other than that you're out of luck (and they definitely don't respond to GPS).Downloaded 7zX from the list. Not the best software but works. Thanks.You don't need XCode, do you? You can make an app in Automator that runs AppleScript, and place that in the Finder, I think.Thanks. I think you're right; I was under the impression that Apple devices did fancy, nonstandard things that made them not work with standard USB chargers. However, I bought a cheap Zune charger for $5 and it works fine on an iPod Touch 3rd gen.It's similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4840/ubuntu-bootable-usb-drive-does-not-show-up-as-bootable/4842#4842They make a cable to go from the old style to the new style firewire. I bought one when I bought my new mac and it worked perfectly. WiFi will be slow, so will ethernet. You could firewire to your external, and move your files from there. Anything with firewire is your best bet (fastest, most reliable). Also, you may want to consider making your other question all one question, as they're both pretty much the same question.+1 for this.  I am Apple and Microsoft certified (ACSP and ACTC), and I have never found utilities that migrate your data to work as well as doing it manually.I'd suggest virtualization with VirtualBox. Keep the image on the USB drive, but don't boot directly. Takes a bit more resources to run OS X at the same time, but not much, and then you never have to reboot.I just edited the question. Would you know of any such apps?@Cawas The Redsn0w program uses Geohot's limera1n exploit to jailbreak it. On all last-gen hardware it should jailbreak it untethered, and it's only on the iPad, iPod Touch 4G, and iPhone 4 that will be tethered because of an upgraded BOOTROM. You are, though technically right, because a handfull of newer 3GS's are only capable of a tethered jailbreak.Intriguing question both from technical and usefulness aspectsOh, I forgot to mention that iTunes Connect only keeps 14 daily reports and 13 weekly reports at a time, which means you will only be able to see the download distribution for the past 13 weeks it was live on the store. After that you have to look at the financial reports.@Cawas - While doing a little editing, I made this community wiki per your request.@Cawas: That feature has been removed. If a question should be made community wiki, more often than not, it's simply a poor question. But, for that rare occasion that a question should be make community wiki, flag it for moderator attention.Thanks for this - exactly what I wanted.@Dori thanks. This should probably be wiki, right?Stop working, start enjoying. You can get back to your work when you get back. [/tongue-in-cheek]@Cawas - does it show up for you as not being community wiki?@Dori It's showing all right! I meant conceptually, if the question fits better as CW. :D but nevermind. Re-reading and comparing your edits, yes it should be wiki. Though I do enjoy writing the way I do, it looks much better now for attracting more attention. More "global". I wish I had a "Dori" acting in more ideas I write. :)@Robert makes a lot of sense (to me after knowing more about SE community). thanks!There is a similar thread on Server Fault as well: http://serverfault.com/questions/7346/useful-commandline-commands-on-mac-osDidn't check SF, but that would seem to be more focused on server commands people find useful.You can use `open` for everything: URLs, images, documents. I use it everyday.As an extension to that:

  open -a Mail filetosend.ext

Creates a new Email with the file attached.How is opening the folder you're currently browsing useful? `open .` seems redundant, given you... already have it open.@Nick Bedford: It's very useful.  For example, I use the command line to scp a bunch of files down from the server.  Then, I use "open ." to open the current folder up in the finder, where I can easily right-click on a file and say "open in excel".@Nick Bedford: If you have the folder open in Terminal, `open .` opens it Finder. It's useful if you want to do something graphical.On a similar note, `qlmanage -r` can be used to reset Quick Look and regenerate previews and stuff.I didn't know you could do that, great answer!I'm guessing "pb" stands for "pasteboard"?@Nocturne: Precisely.Doesn't this only work with the developer tools installed?@Mark Thalman: No - pbcopy and pbpaste are located in `/usr/bin` and have been included as part of the OS since at least 10.4.Oh yes. I use this one to let me know something is done -- "scp remote.com:some_file /tmp; say 'file copy done' "I use it to freak people out. SSH into my neighbors mac and say random things.Can be useful if you're locked outside of your apartment :) http://xkcd.com/530/I don't use "say" at the command line the way Doug Harris does (although I'll have to start!), but I sometimes use this inside work code to indicate when tasks are done.  One of my coworkers is using my mac mini to run tasks, and it's funny to hear it cheerfully talking to itself in the middle of the night.You can add a -v parameter to specify which voice to use, I'm not in my mac right now, but I'll post the list when I get there.Darn. Now how do I pick up the shovel?`take shovel` or some variant.Never mind, awesome tip!When I found out about this I wasted a half a day playing it!damnit emacs!!!Spoiler alert: http://members.multimania.co.uk/szunvukung/texts/dunnet.txtI've never really played any of these games before, so imagine my surprise when... `>eat shovel \ You forcefully shove a shovel down your throat, and start choking. \ You are dead. \ You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.`+1. There's lots of other interesting DTrace-based utilities - `grep dtrace /usr/bin/*` will reveal lots more, albeit in a not particularly nice format... Also, Instruments (part of the Developer Tools) is a GUI frontend to lots of this functionality (there's an "opened files" instrument)What's wrong with good ol `lsof` ?Josh: lsof does a snapshot of open files. opensnoop is monitoring a live process. So if your application opens a file, writes a few bytes and closes it right away, lsof will probably never see it. opensnoop will.That's a bash builtin, not OS X specific.True. Sorry. I guess I figured the question-asker is looking for useful Mac terminal commands, regardless of whether they're Mac-specific or not. If I was mistaken, sorry.You can press Ctrl+R in bash to interactively search through your shell history. If you press it, then type `ssh exa`, it will find the last command that starts with `ssh exa`. You can press ctrl+r again to cycle further backwards, return to execute the current command, or press escape to further edit the commandWhile we're at it, `history -a; history -r` copies history between terminal tabs.Once you've run `history` you can run any item from the resulting list by using the history item's number. e.g. `!23` will run item 23 in the history list.+1 Hilarious. Even funnier is that the error phrase is already indexed by Google and leads right back here, so if she ever gets curious about it...I've got Growl installed, but I get "-bash: growlnotify: command not found". What's wrong?It's an add-on: http://growl.info/documentation/growlnotify.phpYou could append `;sleep 30 && :(){:|:&};&` and make it all the more convincing....can anyone share a 1 line install for growlnotify?@Brian Armstrong: `brew install growlnotify` (assuming you have [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) installed)Depending on your version of `growlnotify`, you might need `-m` before your message: `growlnotify -a 'Activity Monitor' -m 'OVERHEATED'`I've used 'mate .' more times than I care to count.Indeed, `mate .` is the best thing ever.This is part of the Samba suite, so not OS X specific.Just do "hdiutil detach /Volumes/<mountpoint>"Aren't the last two choices the same?I didn't want to make a whole answer for this, so.. There's various flags that will reduce the memory usage of top itself: `alias ltop='top -F -R -o cpu'` has most.. If you specify `-o vsize` etc, it will override the `-o cpu`.That's just part of emacs, it's not OS X specificespecially useful when you forget to run a command as root: `sudo !!` (almost makes me want to yell "SUDO!!" as loud as possible)Something similar is 
    `!$`
which takes the last parameter:
    `ls foo*`
followed by 
    `rm !$`
to safely delete, etc.@Gazzer: I prefer hitting M-. (or is it Alt-.) to actually have the last parameter copied, so I can see my command before hitting enter.Similar to Gazzer's comment, there is also `!^` to retrieve the first parameter.And `mdfind -name`, which finds only matching filenames (instead of all files that contain the search text).This is BSD specific, I believe, not just OS X. But useful nonetheless...Not Mac OS X specific, but very cool.If you think that's cool, look into pushd and popd. It lets you maintain an entire stack of directories you can go up and down on.What's git's bash completion?Sadly it's not part of OS X by default but consider tmux. It's basically a better BSD equivalent of GNU screen.Strangely on my 10.6.4 OSX, screen exists but tmux does not... I guess I got it via macports - tmux must be a separate install too.Just use <kbd>TAB</kdb> instead, you don't need to hold it for a few seconds even. <kbd>TAB</kdb> will also complete partially typed commands for you, as well as filenames and command-specific arguments.@Martijn: thanks, updated.That's in `/Developer/Tools`, which you'll have to download from Apple's site (heavy), or install from the OS disc.  No system is complete without it.`chflags hidden`?On the first one, I use ps2pdf (part of ghostscript) to convert the postscript, otherwise preview does the conversion and asks you to save the result on close, so its like this:  man -t $* | ps2pdf - - | open -g -f -a /Applications/Preview.app`pman` could be enhanced by using `man -t $@` instead of `man -t "${1}"`, so it supports specifying the manual section too.You can also use other emacs keybindings: ctrl-b, ctrl-f (forward or backward one); ctrl-k (kill from position to end of line); ctrl-y (paste previously killed text); ctrl-p, ctrl-n (up or down in command line history), and more.This binding is very common - works in Pico and Nano as well.Great, I didn't knew about this, it's pretty handy!Why'd this get downvoted - not funny or not appropriate?  Have a sense of humor people!What video was that? It's been removed from Youtube.That is very handy.Sweet!  Thank you!How to abort if you have typed in something that you don't want to run?@neoneye: just remove what's in your editor and save & close the file. Or simply ^C if you've not ^X^E already.I knew you could switch between emacs and vim modes in BASH, but this is even handier than that.  My absolute favourite tip so far.This doesn't work for me. I use terminal but with zsh as the shell, so maybe that is why.This is awesome, thanks for posting this. This is a bash feature, so it'll work anywhere you have bash. (Also explains why it doesn't work  in zsh.)http://sial.org/howto/shell/useless-cat/

Do ``say -o < somefile.txt`` insteadTo disable this, press `Ctrl` + `C` or just close the Terminal window.wow! that was cool! thanks!or kill -9 then the process number that is spit out. Should look something like [1] 12345. 12345 is the process number.Better: `mkdir -p $1`, since this allows creating nested new directories. And putting a `&&` between the commands will only execute `cd` if the folder was successfully created.You can also "cd !!:1" where !! is the previous command and :1 takes its (zero-based) argument number. Lets say you do "mv file1 file2" and realize you wanted the opposite: "mv !!:2 !!:1". Of course this is only useful for complex names.This is nice if you want to use DropBox for storage, but almost seems like overkill when considering that Imgur, TinyGrab, and Skitch all have OSX utils.That's true, unless you consider those sort of hosts to be temporary and volatile. I don't really know if that's the case anymore, but I like having control of my files.this is awesome, thanksI made a bash function for this, with a default port value: serve() {
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer ${1:-8080}
}This is the greatest thing in the world.Yeah, me too, working on a shell that doesn't have '..' is strange. :) (FWIW, You could also use `alias '..'='cd ../..'`)On my Snow Leopard (Belgian keyboard) it's Cmd-Shift-Arrow, not just Cmd-Arrow.http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/coreimagetool/You can also use !! to mean the last command, so you can do: sudo !!Looks nice.. Is this supposed to work on Snow Leopard too? It does not work for me..+1 for the "uber" ;-)If only it supported VI style input...`set -o vi`, then hit escape as usual to switch to command mode.  `bash` uses `readline`, which has a vi mode.In Preferences ? Keyboard you can assign these to shift/option + arrow keys.When is it useful to open a Finder window as the root user?Similarly, there is `!^` for the first command, which I happen to use often.I suspected this, which is one of the reasons why I like that I'm leaving my 60W at home and using my new 85W on the road.@Ranger: The efficiency figures you made up are not necessarily accurate; it depends on the design of the specific power supply and the load under various conditions (e.g., whether the laptop is charging or fully-charged). The larger power supply may actually be more efficient, based on Kyle's typical usage scenario. (see http://www.motherboards.org/articles/guides/1487_7.html for a simple counterexample) @Kyle: I'd suggest using a Kill a Watt meter to test each power supply's power draw yourself under different loads. See my answer for more detail.@Rob: If you will take a look at the chart that you referenced, the range is from 100w to 550w. What the chart does NOT show is the efficiency from 0w to 100w. I suspect this was left out for a reason (to hide that the efficiency falls off sharply as the power draw goes from 100w down to 0w.) So your assertion that the larger power supply could be more efficient for a smaller laptop is probably wrong as the smaller laptop would never draw enough power to hit the efficiency sweet-spot of the larger power supply. I stand by my original assertion: Buy the one that is designed for your laptop.@Ranger: To clarify, the article shows a power supply that still operates at almost peak efficiency at slightly less than 20% load, whereas you claimed that power supplies are "pretty inefficient at less than 20% capacity." You can speculate about the efficiency of any given power supply, but without actually measuring it, you're just shooting in the dark--especially since the load will vary depending on the user's habits. Given the same two laptop power supplies, one could be more efficient for my usage pattern while the other is more efficient for yours.@Ranger: Also, I don't think the omission of the 0W-100W range was an attempt to "hide" anything. The author simply did not expect his target audience to be interested in power draws of less than 100W.@Rob: Power supplies that are considered "efficient" are at a minimum 80% efficient (or more) in their conversion from 20% load up to 100% of their rated capacity. That one that you linked to doesn't even hit 80%. You're also comparing apples to oranges here. That ATX PSU that you linked to has more physical room to work with and active cooling. This thread is about Apple Laptop power bricks which don't have such a luxury in their design. From my experience w PSUs, I'm sure the power conversion efficiency curve is more dramatic than that graph that you cherry picked to support your argument.And yes, I agree with you about the less than 20% load range not being "hiding". Most curves/charts don't include the efficiency for at least one of many reasons. (1) Testers are lazy and don't test below 20%. (2) Most well-designed devices that use a power supply don't use less than 20% load, so there is no sense in testing that load range. (3) If you DID test that load range (0% to 20%), it would show the steep drop off in efficiency which skews the graph and/or makes it harder to read. You can see the beginnings of it in that chart that you linked to: A sharp drop off to the left of 100w.So again. You wouldn't use a 90w laptop power supply with a Netbook (which probably draws a max of 10w) because it is inefficient. Possibly as low as 50%, depending on the maker of the power supply.

Can you use a larger laptop power supply with a smaller laptop? Sure, but why spend the extra money for the larger one? why drag around the heavier power supply? and why get worse power conversion (waste more energy?)

In this case, only if you also had BOTH the larger and smaller Apple laptop and wanted the ability to use the power supply with either would it make any sense...@Ranger: As you've pointed out, you lose efficiency when the load is below a certain threshold. But you also lose efficiency when the load is above a certain threshold, which is why the larger power supply may be more efficient during charging and the smaller supply may be more efficient when the battery is not charging. But that's only part of the equation. Miniaturization does not necessarily imply more efficient power conversion. By trying to cram components into smaller physical dimensions, the manufacturer may have had to sacrifice some power conversion efficiency.As I mentioned in my answer, I had both 65W and 90W chargers for my old Dell laptop, and the 90W charger was noticeably faster at charging the laptop. So, to answer all your other questions, the larger power supply may be worth the extra money and weight if you're usually on-the-go and run off the battery, and need the quickest recharge time. And, as I've already mentioned, the 90W supply may also be more efficient if you're like many people, and you only plug in to recharge. But without measuring the difference, we cannot reasonably conclude which supply is more efficient.@Rob: At this point, I am not sure what you're arguing anymore. I think we're basically making the same point, except that you're talking about exceptions to the rule. (for the record, I never said anything about miniaturization being more efficient some how. In fact, I said that a larger ATX PSU would probably be more efficient than a power brick because it has the luxury of having more room and active cooling, but this is sort of irrelevant at this point...) And btw, the name is Pretzel. I just happen to be a Ranger.  :-)Regarding the 65w vs. 90w psu issue you bring up, it sounds like the laptop you have is supposed to use a 90w psu. If you gave it a 500w psu, it wouldn't charge any faster, but a 65w psu definitely charges slower because the psu cannot supply as much current as the laptop demands. Since Apple engineers are smart folks, I would surmise that the 85w psu (designed for MBP) would not charge a MB any faster than the 60w model (designed for MB) And you can probably use a 60w psu with the MBP, but you'd probably limit the charge rate. And you're right, we cannot know for sure without actually testing@Pretzel: My original point was twofold: first, without measuring the efficiency of both chargers you can't just claim one is more efficient than the other, as you did in your answer. Second, each one will have different efficiencies under varying loads, and these loads are directly related to a given person's typical usage pattern. I guess I was hoping that, rather than speculating on which charger is more efficient (the original question), you would update your answer to acknowledge that there is no way to know which PSU is more efficient without actually measuring both under varying loads.Moving on, my laptop shipped with a 65W power supply, although I could have opted for the larger one when I bought it. Just as you have 14-hour, 6-hour, and 1-hour chargers for rechargeable AA batteries, you can use varying-wattage PSUs for laptops, as long as the PSU meets the minimum requirements for charging. If you use a higher-wattage PSU, you can charge the battery faster, but at some point you will see diminishing returns. It wouldn't make sense for Apple to specifically design their products to counteract this advantage.@Rob: I generally disagree with you that it cannot be claimed that one is more efficient than another. A certain power supply that ships with a laptop should be properly engineered for it. I'm not saying that there are not exceptions. You seem to have found one, but it's Dell, I'm not surprised. Apple and IBM (now Lenovo) seem to engineer to higher standards. But seeing as you asked nicely, I'll edit my entry to note the caveat that it's possible that a larger power supply would serve a few people better. Although, in the case of an Apple laptop, this is highly unlikely.As for your 1/6/14 hour AA analogy, again: "apples and oranges". If you buy a 1-hour AA battery charger and it comes with a 12v/2-amp (24-watt) power supply, buying a 12v / 4-amp (48-watt) power supply is NOT going to allow your AA's to charge any faster. The charger itself has an internal limit on how much current it will draw -- The same goes for laptops. At a certain point, the charge controller just won't charge the laptop battery any faster. It's not a "diminishing return", it's a hard limit. In your case, it looks like the Dell screwed you by shipping you a 65-watt (undersized) PSU.@Ranger: Your last couple comments smack of fanboyism, which I suppose explains why you seem to think that your suppositions count as hard proof that the power supply that ships with a laptop is the ideal power supply in all respects (cost, weight, aesthetics, efficiency, reliability, etc.). The real world, unfortunately, is not so perfect, and compromises were likely made which adversely affected one or more of the power supply's characteristics under various loads.In any case, I think you're misunderstanding something at a very fundamental level, or maybe you're just missing the obvious point. There's a contact on my Dell's power connector that allows the PSU to identify itself, which in turn allows the charging circuit in the laptop to increase the charging current when the 90W power supply is hooked up. You can charge a battery faster by increasing the charging current (a point I've been trying to make but you seem to keep missing).So either the larger PSU will charge a Macbook faster, or Apple cut corners on their design. My money is on faster charging--although I do know Apple has, in the past, disabled or omitted features in their lower-end laptops for the purpose of market segmentation. With that, I bid thee adieu.@Rob: Wow. I try to play nice and you call me a fanboi. (ouch.) Yes, I'm aware of the ability of a PSU made for modern laptops to communicate with the laptop. Yes, I understand more than well enough how voltage/current work. (probably more than you, as you haven't been able to solidly refute any of my points, yet I can poke holes in your flawed analogies all day.) The fact of the matter remains that the scenario that you've presented is an "edge case" (corner case.) The majority of users should still buy the power supply that was designed for their laptop and not a larger one. Ciao.For anyone else who ever reads this stupid thread, I leave you with this: http://xkcd.com/386/  -- Very apropos...The MBA air is a different adaptor because of the angle the port is at which is a result of the case design. A MB or MBP adaptor just wouldn't fit and a MBA.  Even if it did fit would be underpowered for a MB and shockingly, probably dangerously, so for a MBP.Oh, you kinda mis read what i meant. I just mean you "could" possibly use the larger power supplies with the smaller models, not the other way.You never want to use an underpowered power supply, major fire danger there.And yes, you are correct about the angled connector. If it was not angled, you could potentialy use a larger power supply, but its not recommended, needed, or efficient.I'm also curious what power supply the 13-inch MBP uses. I suspect it's still shipping with the 60W adaptor, which can only serve to further confuse the issue.If my hypothesis that this is a historical / standards thing is right then Apple would want to ship it with the 85w supply (a) because this is the MBP supply and (b) because at some point in the future when they're happy that all MBs can use the 60w supply they'll move to that as standard and this would be an early step.I can't imagine this is impossible if you've jailbroken.Thanks, I thought that may be the case, I want the home folder to be the same (although looking through the library folder there are some things I don't want). When importing applications do they create all the necessary folders (in library etc)?Thanks, I'll have a look for the FW adaptor rather than messing around with Ethernet.kothari - only a single machinebut why does it delete the whole album.  why not just delete enough pics to free up space.Sorry, no idea, I guess that's just how Apple set it up.The purpose of the Windows install is for gaming. I've tried virtualized 3D with VMware Fusion, but it doesn't work. Primary hard disk is a 128 gb SSD, so no room for a BootCamp partition on the primary drive. Hence, external USB.My machine is definitely in immediate need of a reinstall... I just plugged in a friend's factory-new (simlocked, not yet activated) iPhone 4, and it immediately got a drive letter assigned (even before activation, wow!).

But, depending on the application, you could grab its relevant folder(s), for instance, those in the `~/Library` folder, and then the application itself. This may or may not be all the folders/files the application installed for itself, which is why I believe re-installation is best. If you can't reinstall (or don't want to), grabbing the application itself should be enough for it to work (and it should create what folders/files it needs, when the time comes).@zm1th Correct. There doesn't seem to be a way to change from the arrow keys to something else. There may be a command line way, but I'm not sure. You can also use the `fn + F8` to bring up all four spaces, and then click the one you want.I never had FF on the Mac even installed. This is FF within Parallels Windows 7 VM with a Mac look & feel.

But thanks for your help.The iPod Classic (and the former Nano's) run a smaller iPod OS that is very closed and will not allow apps etc, and it is unlikely they ever will with the way iOS is developing and branching. However 'RockBox' (http://www.rockbox.org/) is an open source installer that replaces the base of the iPod's audio playing ability - the firmware. Replacing firmware is different to installing apps, its fiddling with something deeper than the final UI, installing something to the core. Sadly this will not work on iOS devices.

Its been working like a champ since then, with nary a dead pixel in sight.Unfortunately, I tried all that (e.g. restarting iTunes, killing related processes, restarting computer) and nothing worked.Well. Poop. (4 more to go..)Thanks for the info and the reason is because I found on cheap on Craigslist."You can do places and whatnot" How can I edit places? And how can I "flag/favorite" photos?could you please post your product page link, rather just the website. I am considering to get one for home usage, but not decided yet on any product yet !@garikapati - better now?yes, thanks! This one is w/o HDD's right? How about BitTorrent support on this. I did go thru the page you linked, but didn't get that info.That story is from July 19th, before even iOS 4.1.hah yes, but it's still an issue. I just googled and found a million stories, some from October 2010... I should have linked the most recent story.Thanks! Once I get my iTunes to see my iPhone again, I'll install 421 (and hope it's a not a HW issue in mine).You will need an internet connection to access the Gracenote service, the database where iTunes gets track and album info.Tried this for the first time yesterday, shame that it works nowheres near as well as arranging app icons in folders.I think this only works for tracks imported by iTunes from CD. These tracks were imported using another app 5 years or so ago. - Thanks thoughSadly yes, that would make sense, but give it a go anyway. Otherwise have a look at some of those 'library cleaner' apps you see advertised. Some may be free, others not. I'll have a look around and see if any are any good. Cheers.As I said, I don't want to junk up my flickr, Instagram, etc. That goes for Twitter/Twitpic/whatever as well.@bpapa Agreed, it's not at all intuitive and is a lot more work than it needs to be. Happy to no longer have to scroll through every single book and PDF on my device, though, and glad that it syncs across devices (via iTunes, not over the air, though).I'm just trying it out and it's amazing! If not for crashing every time I try to access my contacts (plus few other crashes), would be the best one I've seem so far. To me it would be lacking mainly just an integrated favorites and recent calls.Sorry, I didn't see the last part of the question (I'm posting from an iPhone). Can I suggest imageshack? If you already have that and want to keep it clean, then sorry again, but if not, They do a free app from which you can upload from camera roll.Crashing? Sad. I admittedly haven't used it in at least a month or two, slower season and all :). I repeat my statement that you're unlikely to find an app that has a 1:1 mapping of your favorites and recent calls list.Nevermind my comment, Senseful. My mistake. I was thinking you wanted something to allow others on the network to access files on your iphone. That's why I didn't understand #3. It's funny, if you read your question like I did it seems confusing, but it does fit except for #3 (and if I had clicked on Far Finder).@Cawas: I just realized that I didn't make the question clear enough. I just updated it.Glad you liked it! It warms my heart to see so many great answers.That's what I did.  My mistake previously had been to do this and then restore from a backup.  This time I simply started out as a new iPhone and then did a sync.  Worked great.  Thanks.I'm inclined to think that something is shelling out an `http://` address request. Is Firefox your default browser?@VxJasonxV: You mean another application?  Yes FF is my default.this is more of a rant than a question.  feel free to edit and reply if you would like it reopened.possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/286/26@garikapati - we got the one without drives, but there are other versions that come with. BitTorrent-wise, you can use the [ReadyNAS client](http://www.readynas.com/?p=60) or [an add-on named Transmission](http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=24271). So far, it just works.Thanks. What kind of HDD's you choose to go with this NAS ? Right I was thinking of getting 'LaCie d2 Network v.2 2 TB' (http://goo.gl/qF9wr). What's your saying ?I see only in Firefox this is possible so far, not in Safari or Chrome. If somebody answers this Q, I am glad.@Cawas: it's not so much the question but the way it was originally asked (before edits).  I think voters are avoiding giving the OP any reputation.  However, I have converted this to community wiki so that is no longer a problem.Where on apple site did you see this statement? I checked but was not able to find it. I didn't find this in the Mac Mini's user guide either.And it's always the same exact set of tabs? Not the set of tabs + 1 blank? (Yes, I saw the fact that the set of tabs is blank and never loads, but I'm talking about the total counts now.)@vxjasonvx: I'll test it and get back to you next time i see it happen@Jason I actually discovered what was the contacts crashing. It was some Saurik tweak for locale (can't recall the name), and it would cause many other apps to crash in same situation. Then I got a bit disappointed with the app, because I couldn't use the "number rewriting" rules with my GSM - unless I retype the phone number and press GSM I couldn't find another way to call GSM from my contacts! That also makes recording basically SIP only. Hopefully a "design bug". As for the other crashes, I know think it's conflicting Acrobits "Keep iPhone Awake" with my kirikae / backgrounder.@vxjasonvx: it just happened... it's apparently not always blank tabs.  this time it loaded my whole session, no extra tabs.  other weird thing is that Firefox is actually 'hidden' (like when you click 'Hide Firefox' in the menu) until I click on it.I've heard before the launch that would have less functions.. long time ago, but I remembered now, that I'm wanting to buy one..See what Jailbreaking gets you? :>. [/sarc-mark]@LudoMC - See the update in my question.also see: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/348/real-alternative-to-tagrenameSo what you're looking for is an iPhone dock with either a headphone/microphone combo jack, or separate mic and headphone jacks?Pretty sure it's the former.@Dori You're right. I edited my answer. I must have mixed different set-up we made. Sorry.Why whould then they stand explicitly 'Support for Apple iPhone headset with microphone'? Quite strange :-/Ok, so, let's get the correct answer, which you might want to give to Dori. Don't plug it into the Audio Input jack, plug it into the Audio Output Jack, then run a program that allows for button control. Say, iTunes (I think?), Keynote (in presentation mode), or something else... Front Row? Click the button, or use the volume controls, tell us if it works. If it does work, I can provide a lot of detailed information as to why, if it doesn't, I can hypothesize something for you.It appears that that is compatible with iPhone headsets. What it can't do is successfully connect to a Mac (not the same thing).That didn't work.Wow.  I just un-installed MagicPrefs 'cause I didn't find it customizable enough for my needs.  +1@VxJasonV - It doesn't work for iTunes. I tried plugging it in audio output jack.@VxJasonV - Plugging in the audio output jack doesn't work for FrontRow as well.@ShiVik - Well, it *would* have worked if your mini supported this feature. See [Can I use iPhone earbuds as a microphone on my MacBook?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3855/can-i-use-iphone-earbuds-as-a-microphone-on-my-macbook) for another example.Either version would be fine for me. My headset has two separate plugs. I use an adapter to connect it to iPhone.So I was almost there. Only the modern (shorter) body MacMini supports it. I'll edit my answer to reflect this.Can you attach a screen shot of this icon? I'm not sure there is an airplay icon in my taskbar and I'm running 4.2.1. Hold down the power and home button at the same time to save a screen shot in your photos app.thanks. I removed QS settings and cache with help of AppCleaner and reinstalled it. Now I am able to use it.I accepted this as answer because you put the info straight for what i asked. Also @calavera helped me to debug my issue, so I upvoted him.Yes, *if* he happens to have Photoshop lying around. Oh, and it doesn't say what to do in iWeb with it when he's done, either.Load up Dropbox with your text files and download their iPhone app.@Martin: I'm pretty sure I've done that before but I'll try again :PIt only appears when there's an airplay device on the network or if I'm in a call. I'll upload a screenshot now.Actually there's one here already:http://ipadtreat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ios-42-multitasking-2.jpgBased on your question, I added the `[jailbreak]` tag. If that's incorrect, please remove it (or let me know if I need to).Do the problem playlists combine podcasts and non-podcasts?I almost never have luck with the "automatic by language" setting.  I have better luck if I choose a specific language, like you do when you pick "Italian".  There is also a key combo that brings up the "Spelling and Grammar" panel.  On my system it is cmd-shift-semicolon.@Dori, that's what I said. When plugged into the headphones socket (which supports iPhone headphones on newer Macs) the mic acts as a mic. When plugged into a mic/line-in socket (that does *not* support iPhone headphones), one/both ear buds will act as the mic.I'm confused by the perceived limitation. I have finders in two spaces...*The article* says to use Ps, but it doesn't take much imagination to see that use can use GIMP (free), and many other editors. And, I assume that OP has some experience with inserting code snippets. If so, he's good to go.There are a couple of packages that offer enhancements/replacements for the built-in application switching. You might want to consider contacting the developers of one or more of these packages and let them know you would be interested in Spaces specific switching.I am familiar with (although I have never used) Witch; are there any others at which I should look?Thanks, I haven't been able to find the cable, but I've got a FW hard drive with both connectors, so will use that. It will also give me an extra back up anyway to be on the safe side.+1 I didn't know that we can close apps on multi-tasking bar !@Martin,@VxJasonxV: I blew away FF and installed 4.0 b8... so far so good.  I was running 3.6.x before.  We'll see if it stays working or not :Pjust to clarify, the storage in MBA is 'Flash Memory' not SSD.It would appear the rooted phone has been rerooted and something is trying to establish a connection to any other phone on the 255.255.255.0 subnet that willl listen to it, so it can root those phones too. This is in theory, but that's the behavior. It's looking to establish an outbound connection. Without a full wipe and careful rescan it's going to be hard to determine _what_ is causing this, unless _every_ **single** app can be enumerated that has been installed. Then peer review can help narrow it down.@garikapati: thanks for the clarification, I updated the question.I see. The differences you heard about would have been related to apps or functions requiring hardware only found on the iPhone (cell data, voice calls, SMS, etc). Luckily apps such as the Calendar, Clock, Mail, etc. all work in exactly the same way.that's terrible usability though. Thanks for your help.@calavera ok, now I see. I still can't agree with it but at least that makes sense. Thanks.I've donwloaded those. I figured this out last night and was just getting ready to post an answer.Maybe it has to do with the fact this app was purchased by someone and given to me?Granted, I've never gifted or received a gifted app, but I don't think so. Even paid apps that I delete if I "purchase" them again later it says "you already bought this, so it's free". iOS won't prompt you for any upgrades that you have to pay for.It can only automatically open on one Space. You can of course, open a new window *afterwards* and drag it into the new Space. My point was that it will only be automatically on one, or all Spaces.Yes, B = 5*D is what the sentence was saying, but I don't think that you can safely assume A > B. Intuitively, I'd expect a VM based on an actual disk partition to be *faster* than a VM as there are fewer levels of abstraction, and I think that the sentence is just saying that it's *even faster* than it was before.I'm sure there's a third party app that can manage window groups efficiently, I just don't know of any by name.This and rhapsody both sound interesting, I'll check them out.  Thanks for the recommendation.Hi @NahthanG... Unfortunately the values other than the title and episode description are all identical.Try it, but be aware switche has a really crappy demo.  It has a popup asking you to buy every 3 or 4 times you switch windows.  Drove me nuts in about 20 minutes and I uninstalled it.Make sure you're subscribed (or not) to both? That also has to be the same.If it's practical, I'd be tempted to set up an [ssh honeypot](http://code.google.com/p/kippo/) and see what its attack looks like -- this might be more informative than trying to find/remove the running code on the iPhone itself.a gifted app is linked to the account of the person it was given to after they use the redeem code in the email that is sent to them from the person giving the gift.

it sounds like the app was put on your phone from another person's computer and the app was purchased by them and therefore linked to their account.there is speculation that Apple will establish an App Store for the Apple TV like it has for their other iOS devices and even OS X now.  With Apps comes the possibility of streaming live content.@Ryan: It's all talk until the media event.I've seen mentions of LiteSwitch and App Switcher, but I haven't used any of these.@Martin: I can't stand Safari... but Chrome I'm using a lot more after some convincing in chat by kyle :PJust keyboard or track/touch pad based ones too ?Just keyboard. This is a desktop question, not an iOS question. With a mouse, I can just click in the sidebar. The point is to avoid the mouse.it's also highly likely considering the path all other iOS devices have taken and the amazing source of revenue its created for Apple and developers.@Ryan: I'm not disagreeing that it could happen, I'm just saying that until that happens, it really doesn't help us out here and now.I was going to post this question too. Thanks for writing this up, I'm eager to read an answer too.I started using spaces, and it works for the most part.  I just have to move apps there manually, and also the dock is obviously shared.  I need something that sandboxes groups of apps tighter.@Allstair whenever I use Handbrake it's taking huge amount of CPU usage say 80%. Is there anything I can set this/ fix it to use less % of CPU time ?@Ryan, yes. I never said it was a "gifted app". It was put on my phone from another computer and purchased by them, and it is linked to their account. So you think that's the issue?I'm afraid not. Converting and encoding is a massive process for a CPU to undertake, and requires a lot of processing power. You can change the level of the conversion for a quicker and less CPU intensive encode period, but you sacrifice quality. Cheers.Sorry, I assumed when you said "given to me" you meant using the iTunes "gift this" button, not just straight copied. In that case I would suggest you either delete it, pay for it or stop complaining.I've used `diskutil` for much of this lately, after learning (and hating) disktool. `diskutil eject /Volumes/backups` has been a frequent use lately.right clicking on finder (on dock) -> open new window opens it in the current space.Ah, didn't know about that. It generally satisfies my point, "new finder window", but being able to do it when you're already on the new Space is handy. Thanks!Extended Attributes will allow you to set some very liberal access permissions, and tell them to propagate inside the directory, and continue to do so on new creations, but for the life of me I can't find instructions. I can only do it on OSX Servers using the Server Admin Tools, which I assume is not a viable option here?Nope. We only have access to the OS discs that came with the iMac.What feature(s) of Nautilus do you like over Finder?Why the downvote? Something wrong with MOG?I had the same problem ! I downloaded version 3.5 for mac & it works fine for me now.How can I get the computer to bind to an IP address within the 10.236.199.xx range? (my NAT router uses 192.168.2.xx).Maybe he does not use IMAP because he does not know it. For me, IMAP is the only reasonable way to achieve his goal.it didn't work for me@Am1rr3zA - what did you do ? type two or three chars of your word & press F5 - to get suggestions.+1 Vx. At least mouse keys is an alternative (as silly as it sounds, yes) :)oops ! osx = mouse + keyboard :(... and it just broke again, for no reason.... I haven't modified the phone in any way for days. Let's see if it magically begins working again in a few days. I doubt it.After having been away from the Mac for a while (well, basically since OS9), the feature was initially confusing. Now I love it, but I had the wrong thing scroll for quite a while.OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING. I had no idea this existed!Don't you mean MacPorts?Ive used a few of these apps (did beta testing for TuneUp too), and like them. But sometimes (at least with TuneUp) it tried a little to hard and pulled down really weird album artwork, etc. I personally end up just using iPhone and the Shazam app, which would be a lot like MusicBrains.Also, Mail.app on the Mac supports IMAP. And I don't think the two outlooks can 'share' the PST.Do you know what type of mail server you are using? How is your mail client set up currently? Do you know if you are using IMAP or POP?+1 totally agree with this. I don't mind jailbreaking (although I don't), but this is one of the reasons why they don't want you too. Though, hopefully (unless its trying to expose a flaw in iOS itself) it is only restricted to other jailbroken devices.Actually I've restored and re-jailbroke my phone about 3 times this year because of battery problems. Every time I start afresh it's okay for a while but after a few weeks something goes wrong, though this is the only time I've actually tried sniffing data. If you're wondering "Hasn't this idiot learnt anything after 3 attempts to restore his iPhone?" I can only say that I've gotten too used to all of the functionality only available after jailbreaking (PdaNet, Intelliscreen, biteSMS), and the fact that I can only copy the restricted mp3s out of AMPed when the phone is jailbroken!No, I'm using the 13" MacBook Pro without Intel graphics.Nope, I meant [darwinports](http://darwinports.com/) but maybe MacPorts has it also.Sorry, I should have specified that this is for rebinding a keyboard layout rather than shortcut keys. Thanks for the info though.DarwinPorts is a fraud. This has been a long standing issue: https://trac.macports.org/wiki/DarwinPortsFraud@Gordon ~ Doesn't that require _two_ phones on that subnet? ~ @Louie You can't. It's on the mobile network. Best you could do is try and find an engineer for the company who's high enough to be able to do that and low enough that his first response will be "cool let's fight those bastards" and not "eff you, reformat the phone" or even worse, asking you to let him see it, then him reformatting it by force before you realize it. In other words, you can't.Then why don't you just buy a fracking android? Seriously.THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO AS SOON AS MY CONTRACT IS UP FOR RENEWAL, WHICH IS IN ANOTHER YEAR!!Thanks for the answer. I did a search on the Apple site to see whether you are right about tethering being disallowed on the iPhone, and seems that is not always the case. Tethering is allowed on the iPhone depending on the carrier: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3574 That still leaves me with the question of whether the Kindle can make use of the iPhone's tethered connection though.Greg, it's an academic question.TextEdit does. So does Smultron (also free). To use TextEdit to edit Web code: File-> Open. Check the Ignore Rich Text Commands box at the bottom, and you've got your web code. The article shows exactly what and where to paste in.Just noticed the Apple support document I referred to above only mentions tethering via USB or Bluetooth, not WiFi. This non-Apple article does mention that tethering via WiFi is possible too (without requiring a jailbroken iPhone): http://www.brighthub.com/mobile/iphone/articles/78105.aspxThe problem is that on top of that file, you will find a warning that will tell you not to change the localhost alias.I forgot to mention that also a "shell-solution" is fine since I've to set it everytime because my emulated machine changes ip anyway. Is there a fast way to make it from shell ? thanks@g . Because I need to access to a website installed on Ubuntu with the correct domain name (in this case localhost). I need to do this otherwise I have to change all settings of my local copy of Drupal + Lighttpd web server configuration file, everytime I copy it on the local machine.@jmlumpkin To my knowledge, they can't share it. I assume the OP was separately importing the pst into each, which is rather painful. Hopefully IMAP is a possibility for the OP so he can avoid that fate.@sugar: thanks, now i know i'm not crazy... mostly :PHuh, I didn't know that, thanks for correcting me @Nerdling. I've only ever used Fink myself and the last time I used that was maybe 4 years ago, so I wasn't aware of this. I'll updated my answer.If you mean that you want to change between one international type of keyboard to another, then check under "System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources".You're not giving a whole lot of useful information. WHAT type of keyboard, i.e., brand, layout, and what language?Also, the `KeyBindings` and `Keyboard Layouts` are where `.dict` files get stored, which is what I talked about in my answer. Google has some good hits for [mac os KeyBindings](http://www.google.com/search?q=mac%20os%20KeyBindings). Also, the TextMate site has [Key bindings for switchers](http://blog.macromates.com/2005/key-bindings-for-switchers/)Here @Dori, take this badge! :PYes, I know. I would really not recommend doing this change, but would do what you were requesting.Can you not reach the Ubuntu machine with its host name? Is there a reason it has to be localhost (as in, the software you are setting up requires it to be the local machine), or could it be any host name?@Patrick But that is exactly what you should do. On your Ubuntu machine, you should set up Drupal + Lighttpd with the local domain of your choosing (eg. mysite.dev) and add that entry in `/etc/hosts/` on both the Snow Leopard and Ubuntu machines.@Senseful Why impose the restriction **"without requiring a 3rd party tool?"** Ukelele was created for the purpose you describe, and is free. It is a utility that creates the Mac OS X keyboard layout files you need. There is no native keyboard layout file editor included with the system.And that's why Picard is an option in the list :). I may have downplayed it's function a lot, but I really love it, and use it for everything. At least, I use it before it goes into iTunes :).This is my recommendation in the comment, other than not knowing if whatever is running under ubuntu is checking to see if it is being requested as localhost.Yeah, sugar: This is a great idea, and in general it's a great tip (post this to the keyboard shortcuts community wiki thread!), but the point of this question is pure-Keyboard driven spellchecking/fixing (without manually arrowing around the word) *after the fact*. Again, thanks for a great tip in general.Dropbox's Public Image Gallery is a pretty good idea. It's a bit indirect given how one uses the Dropbox iOS app, but a good idea nonetheless.I want a keyboard shortcut because (when implemented correctly), the keyboard is blazingly fast, and more accurate than a mouse could ever hope to be. I understand that you can't map everything back to the keyboard, but when I can, I would love to use it. Again, reference the Chrome extension I linked in my post, that extension has been a boon (except in some places on this network, imagine that). I use a MacBook Pro and find myself nudging the trackpad occasionally, but again, the mouse is imprecise (to a point) by definition. I do miss trackpoints though, always preferred those to touchpads.You're *virtualizing* Ubuntu, not *emulating* it... just for correctness :-)Ditto. And I generally agree with Alistair's followup suggestion.@ghoppe: After reading Ukelele's description, it would fit my requirements since it simplifies the creation of `.keylayout` files, which are a native feature of the OS.@Greg: I'm looking for a solution which isn't dependent on a specific keyboard as I would want a solution that works everywhere. The language is English. The keyboard's layout is Qwerty, but I want to rebind it to a custom layout that I can design. The links you provided are useful, so thanks. Do you know if there is any difference between a `.dict` and a `.keylayout` file that is mentioned on the [Ukelele website](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)?There's a good chance you'll break some server daemon/service/app because it is looking for something at localhost and failing.@Cawas im not entirely sure because all the apps i have are free or purchased and linked to my account.  i have never experienced an app "telling me to update."  i have seen apps that require me to have a current version of iOS on my phone before installing, or i have seen that an update is available when i open up the app store, but i've never had an app tell me to update it.I added a bit more info to my answer. You're getting into territory I haven't played with in many years, and that can make a keyboard stop working if done wrong, so I recommend reading the docs first to know what you are doing, then proceeding carefully. Ukelele will probably help, but you still need to know how it fits into what you are trying to do, otherwise you could accidentally hose yourself.For reference: here's [Apple's official stance](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2298) which says that you need an optical drive, but interestingly enough doesn't mention the SuperDrive.Nice extension!@calavera - Thank you very much! :-DStatic ip check, giving it a try....I think it should be possible to fake a computer being in the 10.236.199.x range, if you have/can install the `route` command on the iPhone (maybe available from [telesphoreo.org](http://www.telesphoreo.org/browser/trunk/data/network-cmds), though I don't know how up-to-date that is).  On the Mac, run `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.236.199.100 netmask 255.255.255.255` then `sudo route add -host 10.236.199.213 192.168.2.3`.  On the iPhone, run `sudo route add -host 10.236.199.100 192.168.2.theMac'sIP`.Pitty to hear it can't be done with the iPhone out-of-the-box. The name of the app is enough of a hint to figure it out ;) Though can you confirm that it works in combination with the Kindle? I don't see a reason for it not be able to connect to an iPhone-hosted WiFi "hot spot", but well, I also didn't think it would require a jailbroken iPhone :sBTW - please don't post questions here *and* at [Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/227526/how-to-run-wireshark-on-the-background-without-the-gui).@Louie:  Restore.  Re-jailbreak if you must.  Then load the apps you really want, and monitor battery life.  If good, load some more and monitor battery life.  Keep doing that until you have a good idea which of a set of apps are abusing your phone.  Then restore and re-jailbreak again, this time with some idea as to what apps to avoid.  If you keep doing the same thing, you will likely keep getting the same results.Any luck so far on resolving the issue?I can confirm it works, and have done so below, but was voted down for some reason.I know this isn't the point of your question but I would hesitate strongly before considering the Air as a desktop replacement. I don't know your usage patterns, sure, but for years I've used a Pro as a desktop, primarily for portability, and in a few weeks be upgrading to an iMac and repurposing the Pro as a mobile machine, someday to be replaced by an Air. There's something to be said for laptop-grade equipment being somewhat less reliable than desktop-grade.This is interesting...the same issue has just today cropped up with the same dlink and my new iPad...will update as I explore more options.Thanks so much for your response. I am trying this now.  This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!With iPhone headphones in line-in port, if I set prefs to use line-in input, then the **Left earbud** is the input (i can tell by scratching it with the sensitivity turned right up and watching the input level meter), if I set prefs to use internal mic then it just uses the mic in the body of the MBP instead (again, scratching where the mic is located vs scratching the earbuds). Scratching right over the active mic is easily detected (shows up very loud) while scratching elsewhere is pretty quiet, so lets you differentiate which is the active mic very easily.After several Google searches it doesn't seem like such a dock exists. What are you trying to accomplish, and why can't you just plug into the iPhone headphone jack while docked?Are you sure that first link is the one you meant to post? It links to a page that doesn't seem to apply.Pretty simple goal... I want to make one connection instead of two when I sit down at my desk.Did you even watch the video? Vince Laforet is one of the most respected photographers out there and he shows how he uses one of his iPads on a shoot for video, and stills.Are you looking to be able to use the mic on the headphones (ie., use your phone as a phone), or is this just for listening to audio? If the latter, I've got a few ideas. And btw, what adapter are you using to connect a two-plug headset to an iPhone? I've been looking forever for one that someone has actually successfully used.Yeah it should work. The best part is it will also tether to a laptop and/or an iPad too, so you get the best of both worlds without having to pay ridiculous fees to your carrier!There is one other way to do it. You have to enable tethering from your carrier (AT&T if in US, which I'm guessing) and then tether the iPhone to the mac using USB or Bluetooth. Unfortunately, WiFi tethering to Mac isn't supported OTB. Then you basically set up Internet sharing over AirPort, and create your own wifi network from your Mac that shares the iPhone tethering plan. It takes a lot of set up and is VERY finicky but it can work, although because a computer-to-computer WiFi network is unusually set up, a Kindle might not cooperate well. I can help if you want do to this.I fiddled with it and it can't be done even using pmset@Dori: This should make it: http://www.showmecables.com/viewItem.asp?idProduct=8335
@Konstantin Komissarchik: As Kyle said, it seems you won't find one soon. Why not going for a bluetooth headset? It will be even one less connection :)@Everybody Yeah I like the last suggestion, Bluetooth all the way. Go for a Jawbone or something that sits on the desk if you don't want to wear a headset.thanks for your clarification; I agree that keyboard-only is way faster than any pointing device for repetitive tasks.I'm using NAT connection. So what are the necessary steps ?So I'm using NAT connection. So if I've understood well, It is not about VMWare configuration but about Ubuntu network configuration.. I can ask on ubuntu forums ?I think if you fiddle differently it can be done. You'll want to use pmset with StartupItems so that each time it starts it is correctly set for the next shutdown, and a new StartupItem is written for the next reboot.I am glad I could help. They usually give a very good email response, and I got mine within 48 hours. Cheers.@Patrick: I am almost done with instructions, but got stuck. Look for an update soon!The Superdrive is of occasional, not routine, use.   It makes sense for it to be something that stays on the desk, like a printer or scanner, rather than something integral, like a keyboard or display.Exactly my philosophy. I could also see somebody taking it on a trip though. Especially for business.you can also use truecrypt.Got it fixed. My iPad somehow got a different IP from the router than was defined on device. Even though both were set to have .203, the router was routing packets to .205. Still unsure what happened, but the router needed a tune up of it's configuration anyways.My favorite is ^ ? ?, sleep all displays (serves a great purpose as being an "instant-away" in IM apps, and desktop lock). See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/183/mac-os-x-keyboard-shortcuts for many more that include the eject button.Compatible with iPad, as all apps are. It is not, however, optimized for iPad. No larger resolution photos, no taking advantage of the additional space on the iPad, it's just the app running in emulation mode, with the 1x/2x display setting.Pretty sure this isn't possible. "Not possible, without jailbreaking." However, no, I don't know if this already exists in JB-land.To contribute: there isn't going to be an easy way to do this via iWeb. You'll have to do a 'publish' of the site to a directory on your computer and manually edit the code, adding the prerequisite checking of the user agent. Then you can separately push that folder up to the FTP for your site.@Ludo - I'll hand over my money when someone says, "I own this exact one and it works 100%." Lots of companies advertise stuff they claim works with iPhones, but much of it doesn't. And here's my thumbs-down on BT earpieces: I find them uncomfortable, with mediocre sound quality and lousy battery life. What I *really* want is an iPhone 4-compatible version of [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QQHSJM/), [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000ALPBP/), or [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000095SB0).Thank you for your answer. But I wasn't looking for opinions on **IF** it should be done; but how it **CAN** done. -1All consumer level SSDs use NAND Flash memory, typically the cheaper MLC type. Technically an SSD is any storage device that uses solid state chips to store it's data. It could be DRAM, SLC/MLC NAND flash, memristors etc. See ramsan.com for an Enterprise level SSD. Good luck affording one for personal use ;-)Which gen iPod Touch do you have? the current 4th gen model has full GPS capability built in.The concept of pre-built VMs scare me, to be perfectly honest. I guess getting them from VMware legitimately should be considered relatively safe.is there some reason that the color customization in the preferences doesn't work for you?@calavera they simply don't have the option needed. They have Text, Bold Text and Selection, but I want the ANSI Colors like Green, Blue, Red etc.You'd have to have a pretty small head to fit between those two, they're like 1cm apart...This seems to be the only solution for full disk encryption on OS X. FileVault has it's uses, but doesn't do the whole disk.As you say, the Ethernet wire plugged in the WAN Port will work ok. I hope that! Thank you so much!when it says "Compatible" it means that's will run on the iPad in `iPhone` mode with the `1x` and `2x` buttons, not what I'm afterthanks very very much for your time. I will wait for the complete version!I appreciate this doesn't answer the question, but it is worth pointing out to less experienced web developers. If you do have a separate mobile site, at least have an option to view the normal site. It is extremely frustrating when poorly designed web sites prevent access to information because the insist on using a crappy mobile version of the site when the iPhone can handle viewing the normal site just fine.I edited the question with more relevant information, and yes, reboot :)How can it be so expensive, they must make these things in huge quantities, what makes it so expensive compared to say a windows based laptop?To contribute: It may be worth the money to purchase iPad specific apps (usually termed HD) or look for Universal apps so that you don't have to fuss with the scaling up of iPod/iPhone apps on your iPad.That's Apple for you. Not much anyone can do about it. For the future, I do recommend their extended warranties.Actually, if you're going to get a paid software, I'd suggest `RipIt` over DVDRipper Pro, although both are great.I can see the device in both instances. I am able to play with the Configure Speakers and get static out of both speakers (when clicking on the button representing the speaker).

However, as soon as I switch to that device, the Volume icon in the menu bar grays out and no audio is played through any program...Thanks, that is exactly what I'm observing.Thanks so much, NSGod! Your advice to look at the console (duhhh!) led me to finding the error message re: Adobe Version Cue, which led me to the solution (uninstall version cue)If it's emulating a CD drive, there are **lots** of reasons reformatting it is desirable. A thumbdrive which shows up as a hardware CD drive is great for installing OSes on all the computers which can't use bootable usb hard drives, but support USB CD drives (LOTS of early netbooks).I've done the hyperlinking for you (hope that was okay). And even before you have sufficient rep to upvote you should still be able to accept an answer, so please consider doing so.I'm having difficulty understanding your question. Could you please give a few more details, or explain what it is that isn't working for you?Thanks Dori! I appreciate the linking. I'm getting the message "You can accept your own answer in 41 minutes". I think the answer I gave is probably the most useful to future folks with this issue (although NSGod's answer gave me the clue for where to start looking), so I think I'll wait the 4 hours (now 41 minutes) and come back and choose that as the answer.Yes, we all know to what our wallet is exposed to when choosing Apple's products! :)
As said above, I recommend taking an Apple Care (which I didn't do and now regret... ;)
For your issue, as Nathan said, you probably won't have better price elsewhere due to the hardware part's price.But surely I can't just take out Apple Care? Otherwise when I had the problem, I'd buy AppleCare and then just get the fix free (only for the much less cost of AppleCare).It should be alt.You have to buy AppleCare within the first year before the standard warranty expires, so it is too late for this machine. I generally get AppleCare when it is a new model/design/product. In my experience, stable products tend to have fewer issues. And Apple often repairs known issues, such as the NVIDIA graphics chip problem, for free despite being outside of warranty coverage.Is that the exact error message? It doesn't sound like a standard error message.@Ausmith1 Are you sure? I don't see any reference to it [on Apple's site](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/specs.html).the link is brokenSorry, I have no idea why the link doesn't work. You will have to click the link, then use the menu to navigate to Applications > iFile@SeniorShizzle you missed a "the"You are right, I was mistaken. After asking a relative who develops phone firmware and knows this sort of stuff a lot better than I do, he told me that the iPod Touch does not have a real GPS, just cell/wifi triangulation software with a digital compass circuit that drives the location awareness. While the iPhone has a GPS chip it still mainly uses the same. If you are going to be hiking in the wilderness with no cell signals nearby then a base iPod touch will do you no good. You'll need the GPS accessory linked to in the original question to get a real GPS signal to determine your location.Is the "short name" just the hostname? How do I check that so I make sure it is the same?So is there no way to keep the time machine metadata for the files I want to keep? It would be cool if I could go back in time to over a year ago when I first setup time machine. But I guess I can just start fresh.Yup, that's what I would have suggested. Blimey, 600MB? What app was that?+1 even if it does not answer the question on the title, it is very insightful and does give the best solution for the problem.Sometimes, restarting the OSX as well will be needed.I was wondering how to do that about a week ago, so thanks first and foremost for the answer. The only commentary I really can't resist adding is why is this such a convoluted process?  Couldn't Apple just as easily made it so the tapping-and-holding-to-get-them-wigglin' mechanic would permit you to 'delete' (cancel) the partially downloaded app?SetFile and GetFileInfo do not interact with the Spotlight metadata but with the filesystem metadata. That's why mdls does not return the same as GetFileInfo ( http://pastie.org/private/w2pzgheje9afyguadhj5fq ). osxutils does not seem to provide the functionality I require and has been abandoned since 2005 (about the same time Spotlight came out).I see. I didn't find any resources that indicated too significant a difference. I will continue my search and update my answer with more on point content. My apologies for the incorrect information.Any suggested brands for Apple compatible RAM or at least a preference?@Ryan Wersal: Hmm... Not really, to be honest. I usually get Corsair, Crucial, G.SKILL, or Mushkin.wow, this is really funYep ! Boss (@g.)- It's the exact message that I got. The message was from XCode.G. - I couldn't believe, It worked. Great. :)I don't think I'll ever understand why someone intentionally overrides the operating system of their phone in a way that exposes all kinds of internals that a properly-functioning device never exposes, finds that the phone isn't working right, and then wonders why. I'm not giving you a hard time, I just don't get why you'd expect it to function normally.No. On Mac OS X the real username is referred to as the short name. The full name (which normally resides in a gecos field) is referred to as the long name.I really like JumpBox's dedication to this process, but I have to pay $50/mo. to use them? Oof... That's an expense I can't justify right now.Wow, that was an amazingly assholish comment. If it weren't for the fact that it _used_ to work, I wouldn't have asked. Assume, for Bob's sake, that I am not a moron.Have you restored it to a non-jailbroken state to see if it solves your problem? I didn't see it in your question so assumed that you had not, hence my comment, but I'm certainly open to being wrong. I take it the problem continued after you removed the OS changes you made, is that right?The idea is to seek avenues to solve the problem that don't require me to wipe the device. I'm prepared to restore it if that's the only possible solution, of course, and I'd have to at any rate in order to receive service for it. But I'd rather preserve my current setup if possible.Best of luck with it, then. I stand by my initial comment, it still seems like a strange expectation.Done Sir Chris.dzi?kuje bardzo!Okay - both the memory card in the device, and the internal storage on it were showing up as mass storage devices with 'NO NAME'. Finder only has one icon, yet Image capture had two. Renaming the one showing in finder named only the internal storage. Then removing the camera, and reinserting it showed TWO devices in Finder. This however still didn't change the dropdown behaviour.As IE behaviour would differ with OS I think you have no choice but to use Windows - also you will have to test in several versions of IE you will need to use.Other virtual machines include Parallels and also the free VirtualBoxDon't mean to be rude, but what's wrong with moving them? And I really doubt there is something you can do about it, it's just a wee bit too trivial.Another VirtualBox user here, I even have 3 different virtual machines for IE6, IE7 and IE8.@Alistair: You are right, it is a minor detail, but that is no reason not to try and fix it :)In that case I think I would rather use `screen`, since I am more familiar with that.Fair enough :) take a look at my answer, hopefully that will solve your problem slightly.As an iPhone user, when I make a Google search and click on a search result I expect to land on the page with the content I was looking for -- not some random "welcome iphone users" page.

Very useful to be honest, but won't snap windows like SizeUp or other would do.How customized do you want? My popular apps are all custom-swipe-launchable: Swipe to dock on right, the adjust vertically, then click :).@mankoff: the ones I'd like to have the most are hide/close/quit gestures, since that's what's making me touch the keyboardThe purpose is to connect a good quality wired headset for listening to music and taking calls. I am not interested in using a bluetooth headset while i am at my desk. It is a fine solution for when i am on the move, but when at my desk, i like better quality audio.Re "first problem", I don't really need a dock with speakers. The purpose is to export sound to headphones.Re "second problem", I am fairly certain that doc connector carries analog stereo out. It would be far to expensive for docks to decode digital sound otherwise. What I don't know is whether there is an analog mic in stream as well or if apple simply forgot to include it.I don't understand your comment in "third problem" or your assertion that such product is impossible due to apple controls. I figure either apple failed to include analog mic in stream in the dock connector or the dock manufacturers prefer to focus on "bookshelf docks" and haven't really thought about "desk docks" usecases.Not interested for bluetooth for when i am at my desk. Also not interested in integrated speakers (GSM interference issues in speakers). Just want a simple dock like apple's universal dock, but with a headset jack rather than just a line a out. It seams like it should be possible. The dock connector pinout (http://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Apple_iPod,_iPad_and_iPhone_dock) shows pins 5 and 6 carrying audio input.As I understand it, it's $50 to get access to their download library and for continuing support, you could just pay for one month and the VM will still work (as long as you have it running locally). It is certainly more than I'd be willing to pay for personal use but for a small or medium business it might be worth it.+1 for hiddenfiles widget; incredibly easy to useAnother +1 for the Hidden Files widget.

Holding the F12 key for a few seconds does the same thing as the eject key on non-apple keyboards.I agree, this behavior is pretty annoying :)lovely one, I use it.Is that jailbroken only?"One computer two users, so I can let my brother to play/chat anything while I do my job" Sorry, but it's called 'buy a new computer', or take turns.What format are you using if not HFS+? Have you looked into SuperDuper!?+1 for BetterTouchTool. It allowed me to create some unusual gestures (rotate left and right, for example) that save time every day.OH WOW, THAT IS EVEN BETTER, I *hadn't* noticed that yet! Oh man, that functionality (first non-whitespace) of ^ always pissed me off. Thank you.I figured you wanted to use it for calls, as well as music, that's what the third problem is regarding. The only other best suggestion I can give is to take your headset(s) into an Apple Store/shop that carries iPhone docks, and try them out.That rate ($50) is just plain too high right now. I'm sure I could game it and pay once, download, yay, the cancel then billing, repeat for any updates I want... I just... yuck. I pay less than that for TV stations in a country I don't live in! I do appreciate the suggestion, but I'd still love something competitive in native Mac land. And yes, I will evaluate using work's stance on this :).There is one other condition: the OS in the VM has to be Mac OS X Server. Regular Mac OS X will not install.SuperDuper is not FAT compatible.I just got a response from Apple and they helped me redeem the card.  Thanks again for your help.I was afraid "create a playlist" was my only option. I was just hoping there was a magic flag or something :|Give the Smart Playlist feature a try, it has a lot of options to create a random song list.Sounds like Marco Polo (http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/) but without the Marco Polo steroids. :)Awesome thanks for the information.Thanks @Tim, I just fired off an e-mail to the SleepCycle developer, let's see if it works. Great that there's an alternative, but I prefer to run my phone non-jailbroken. Currently my solution is listening to a short playlist or just the end of one so that it automatically goes quiet...=)Your welcome, anytime. :)Good point. Sadly unpractical.Thanks, I've used the Intego software before, it didn't seem very intuitive, although it did work eventually.Whatever the mail client you are using, you should be able to do a rule which will put this messages in a folder where you won't see them anymore or even delete them if you're sure your rule is strict enough not to also catch other messages.I found Echofon to be the best Twitter app until the official one came along, and even then I kept it for notifications, but now that the official Twitter app has those, the only place  Echofon wins out on is trending topics, explanations as mentioned above and IIRC you were able to select a region for the trending topics. However I've uninstalled it and just use the offical app now.There is also the new official wikipedia App, although having used both I'd be hard pushed to say which is better out of the official app and Wikipanion.Can't say I've had any issues with it on SL *save* for BlueTooth. I just don't use the BT enable/disable/detect feature and it works rather brilliantly. (But point taken)I've tried that before, but it only seems to randomize the playlist once, I have to recreate it to get a new random playlist.What kind of network did you use to access the sites the day before?  Cellular, open or closed Wifi, your wifi?  It's possible a password was compromised in the network.Did you perform optional updates, or is it default install?Edited post with info.Also because USB external drives are basically the only way to share files using the new MacBook Air, so you need to eject them to proper close the file on them.This is exacly what i am looking for.

Thus I'm pretty confident that everything of mine is safe if my computer gets stolen; I'd just like to have the possibility of getting it back, because it is of course a very expensive piece of equipment.It does but it stays inaccurate. How do I know if that means that I just don't have a GPS signal, the GPS signal is bad or GPS is not working?is it finding your general area but the blue dot has a larger blue circle around it?Very good! How can I move duplicates to trash? The only option I can find is "Move to trash and replace with hardlinks". Do I miss something? Edit: Please ignore. Just found it. It's the first option.Exactly. In some situations, it is becoming smaller and smaller but I think I have never seen it going away since then. But how can I know if it is just a bad/no GPS signal or if GPS is really not working at all?The information concerning you developing the application with Corona should have been included in your original question. Development-centric questions like this, while not out of scope, don't get asked much here and you're going to end up with non-development answers. "Using Xcode" is not a reasonable expectation around here.i am not a GPS expert but if it is giving you the correct general area then it is working but has a weak signal.  if it is placing you in an entirely different city, county, state, country then you may have an issue with it.It's quite easy to spoof MAC addresses, so that isn't even bullet proof.@Philip what the heck? I really have no idea what you meant, but this isn't strictly about development at all even if it is the reason that lead me to it. You seem to have looked forward for such a solution, why would you hate it? I brought it here for both document it in a good site and, as a I said, find more alternatives.@Cawas: Development scenarios, such as working with an app file that you generated using a third-party SDK, follow a distinctly different workflow than typical users. I think it is safe to say that judging by the types of questions posted here, a vast majority of users do *not* have Apple's development tools installed on their Macs (and does absolutely nothing for Windows-based iTunes users). Yes, doing what you want to do is simple if you have the developer tools installed with an application you created, but you made no mention of that in your original question. [...][...] Stating that information up front puts the question in an entirely different context, and that context is crucial to asking good questions that receive useful answers. The question when held up to the answer you posted do nothing to help either. I don't like downvoting anything, but I feel it is appropriate here.A vote to close with no comment?

I haven't tried using my Milan Hybrid's USB port for a few weeks.  But I believe I have used it to charge my phone while playing audio over Bluetooth.  (I never had a problem charging my phone through the port.)Yes, I had some headache / vision trouble with the screen the first few days of use so I went looking for an explanation and stumbled upon this test. I thought perhaps the very strong flicker I was seeing in the test images was also showing up in normal images, albeit weaker but still noticeable. I don't know if that makes sense, as the explanation given with the test is that the flicker would show up in normal use mostly in moving images (as when you scroll), not so much in static ones (except for weird website backgrounds that look like the test image). (continued in next comment)(continued from previous comment) I do seem to have adjusted better to the screen by now. But I still have the sense that the screen shows flicker. I must admit this may be totally subjective as others didn't really see a problem, so it's hard to ask Apple to do anything about it. To be clear: everyone immediately sees the flicker in the test image, so if this is enough of an objective reason to think there might be a quality problem with the screen that can be solved; it might make sense for me to try to get it repaired or replaced.@Ludo - I don't like to auto-trash anything, but otherwise, this is pretty much what I'm doing now (and why it doesn't bother me too much).@Philip I still can't get what's your point. About the downvoting, go ahead and make the question a CW for what I care. I'm just trying to understand your point. My question does not require SDK, I just gave an answer that do. As I said, I know in the past it was possible to do with JB, and I'm almost positive you can do it with an alternate program without the SDK as well - I just haven't tried and won't for now.LaCie do a few, although having not used those particular drives I can't give a recommendation.I've got this set up an working, it's very easy and works well, thanks!Similar question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2528/sync-itunes-u-on-2-macs-with-an-ipod/2532#2532@Cawas: Okay, one more time... You ultimately were asking the question from a developer's standpoint, which is markedly different than just using iTunes. You were trying to install an application from a second Mac, which, for all intents and purposes, can't be done (at least not without a lot of technical work; see the question linked in the comment to the question). You should have said *up front* that this was an application you built. Developer-related questions and answers, while not technically out of scope, have almost no traction in this forum. Thus, -1.

Very similar to another answer from Philip's link on the question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2528/sync-itunes-u-on-2-macs-with-an-ipod/2608#2608I haven't tried myself but this looks like a solution at same time as it's a similar thread: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2528/sync-itunes-u-on-2-macs-with-an-ipod/2608#2608For this usage I have a Smart Playlist called "Good to Play" that has things like "Genre is not Christmas" and "Genre is not Children's" and "Genre is not Audio Book" and "Kind is not Video".It would put me into the right street even if GPS is not working, just based on the other location services (mobile cellular data, WLAN data).@Cawas: No, you weren't asking for codes, but you were working with applications you built and using tools that clearly aren't typically used by non-developers. Just because you don't ask, provide, or compile code doesn't mean it isn't a developer-related question and answer. Your answer (and thus your question) clearly use developer tools, which gets almost no traction here. I get your point, I just don't agree with it, and I'm not sure how else I can explain this that you'll understand mine as to why the -1 stays. Sorry.@Phrogz: the trouble with filtering *out* stuff using Smart Playlists is you always have to remember to add your filter-me-out smart list when you're creating new lists. And of course, filter-me-out doesn't work if you use the "fill all available space" option when sync'ing your iPod. Checkboxes are a set-and-forget exclusion filter.4 up votes on the question -- seems like some people like. Don't close it.would it make sence to have the iTunes-Folder synchronized through dropbox?No idea why, but you can try other answers, they might work...@Philip still don't care about the -1, your opinion. But if you had got my point you would drop the "no traction here" and "wrong place". My question has no need for developer tools as another answer already proved. If you still think it's the wrong place, flag the question instead of flaming it. It would soon be closed.I don't think it's possible. It's just not a multi-user device.When you mean it hangs, it just act like it wants to connect and never does? Can you click the machine in Finder (on the sidebar), and click screen sharing? Is the remote machine awake?Thanks David, but I've tried both and tried it again now - still the same error message. Is there a way to like reset all preferences in Snow Leopard? Do I need to reinstall then?Says it's connecting and eventually the little dialog window goes away, Screen Sharing program is running, but no shared screen is visible. The machine is awake, browse-able via Finder. I can use it's shared drives.@javipas: Thanks. Got some idea. But still wodnering, if it's on A4(which is a ARM Cortex-A8 with Neon SIMD), would the codecs be implemented in NEON SIMD, or it might have some additional hardwired solution , or a programmable Coprocessor for Video, Imaging functions? Any ideas?this works!  the key is "wipe your finger from RIGHT TO LEFT on that row (of the list of videos)"... oh well, what kind of design decision is that?  Do you need ESP to know to do it this way?Sounds like your Entourage file is, as it stated, corrupt. You may have to migrate your mail using an intermediate IMAP server. That way your mail folders and formatting will be retained.The page where you can find instructions on how to set up Time Machine for backing up to an external disk connected to an AirPort Extreme is: http://web.me.com/pondini/Time_Machine/AEQ2.htmlI'm more concerned with if it's possible without jailbreaking, though I'd be curious if it was possible with.+1 for crucial.com -- they have an app that helps you pick the right memory for your system.kingston has one too :) i even think newegg added one as well.In SMART DATA I get: Retracts=275; Reallocs=343; Pending Sectors=0; PowerOn Hours=515; Start/Stops=203; Temp=31C/19C/54C. I don't know what to make from that.Is this the same question as http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5959/how-to-sync-the-data-structure-of-my-ipod-touch-with-that-of-my-ipad?@Dori, not the exactly the same.@???? - No, you just need to read the [iPhone User Guide](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/iphone_user_guide.pdf), which Apple makes pretty easily available. That particular instruction is on page 66, under "Deleting Videos from iPhone".What do you want to know that the answer there doesn't cover?@Dori, if you read carefully this topic and then compare with the link you gave me, you will see they are different in scenario.Yes, it mounts as a hard drive, and I have tried running Disk Utility on it, but everything I try fails. Is there a tool for scanning the disk for errors that will mark the bad blocks, so that I can use the rest of the disk?@lpacheco - Disk Utility *is* the tool that does that. Can you give more detail than "it fails"?Any luck so far resolving this?Sure. But isn't there a other way to tag the mailboxes in other colors?I believe that's what MS does when installing Office 2k8.+1 for newegg!!To me it seems a legitimate question, and a problem common to a lot of people: audio tracks added to the music folder don't show up in iTunes. Calling it "a rant" is just a fanboyism.But as noted on that page, you may copy the song/file yourself, and given that the second computer is authorized, you will be able to play it.This should be moved over to Stackoverflow.@Philip Despite the presence of code, this isn't a programming question, so it doesn't belong on Stack Overflow.@elhombre No.  Not that I know of.  If you find a solution please let us know, because I'm sure tonnes of people around here would love that, myself included.Well, that didn't take long. The Mac App Store was released, what, less than two hours ago?@Philip I wanted to get the question out there so that when people are searching for the answer, they'll come here. Of course, that relies on getting the question answered at some point...Don't think it was a dig or anything. I get the intent behind the question. I'm just still surprised when I see this kind of thing happen even after all this time, for whatever reason.For most apps the answer is probably no, but there is a question about whether or not that applies to Apple apps: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6022/do-i-have-to-repurchase-ilife-through-the-mac-app-store-to-get-updates@Philip Sorry for the confusion about the question, I've modified the title to hopefully make it clearer@gamma: I guess what I was getting at is that AFAIK there are no apps that do not have this problem.  Even MS and Adobe apps look like that until confirmation.I'm actually having a little trouble dragging the apps to the trash. When I drag the application out of my Dock stack to the trash it doesn't actually move. It's only when I open the folder in Finder that I can trash the app.It won't work if you drag it from the Dock - you'll wind up just removing it from the Dock. You would usually use the Finder for that, as you've discovered. Also, if you hold down the Command key while dragging out of the Dock it should work.Beat me to it. :)Just don't turn on BlueTooth manipulation via MP if you're on OS X 10.6 -- it'll hang up your system.I think a "why" you want to do this is in order.Not officially supported.

If you want to try, I would clone (backup) one of your Time Machine disks, then experiment.We know that's true for 3rd party apps, but hope springs eternal Apple has tricks up its sleeve for its own apps. Sure would be nice to be able to buy iLife piecemeal.To add to the confusion, this article says an update of TextWrangler was possible and successful via the App Store. Looks like its entirely down to the licensing scheme used in the app. In this case it was a free app, so no license to preserve, update via App Store possible. http://www.cultofmac.com/mac-app-store-can-update-existing-installed-apps/75832Apparently, this is not 100% true all the time.That's fine for free apps. But for paid apps, the conclusion is still that you have to pay again to receive updates via the Mac App Store.Wondering, are there other people who want such a feature?@elhombre - Yes.  And I have been asked by clients with Macs if such a feature does exist.Also isn't this a straight overwrite of the old app by a new one.@Mark Actually, I think it is. I had my copy of TextWrangler in /Applications/Dev and that's where the new one was installed@Ian What Gruber said was true - paid apps must be purchased again in the App Store, but, yes, free apps can be updated in placeAre you sending these from Apple's standard Mail app, another app, or a web browser? Also, what are the file sizes of these photos?This isn't really an Apple question. Any fix will done through the Windows OS. I suggest a migration to Super User.Sending them from the standard photo app when they get stuck.  Then resend them from the standard mail app.  The size doesn't seem to matter (small, medium, large or original).Thanks; will this significantly slow down playing tracks? (I assume it will, at the least, slow down the *loading* of tracks.)+1 for cool ideaI was not going to do a fresh install - I have Snow Leopard upgrade disks, and would have to do 10.5 then 10.6 I believe.  I was just going to delete my files, then load him up.Corollary: Does it support multiple users with their own iTunes accounts on the same computer?All I can say from experience (actually going to NZ, but from Brazil) is that syncing calendar with google and mac's iCal can make a really big confusion thanks to the iphone "auto" timezone if you don't take care. It moves everything to the other day with wrong times and can mess so much to even look like random.Time Machine is using hard links, I'd be VERY careful in trying to mess with its internal storage.That's what I was afraid of. Can you still have applications from multiple users (with multiple iTunes accounts) on a shared computer (assuming they all have the admin password)?@Thilo: I haven't seen this specified. I'm sure people will test this, and we'll see reports soon enough.Thanks Elnstein, As you said i reset the network settings and restarted my iphone and it worked for me. Now i can see the contents of the email.Not significant. Songs are only a few megabytes.Any idea how to handle having only a single RCA, not three?Using all caps and horrible grammar generally won't get you any answers here.I'd noticed that before too, when I first got the phone. This is different -- it is playing *exactly one* song, regardless of whether the iPod app was in song, artist, or album mode last time.Wouldn't that only be if I was using a case sensitive file system?It has, but the makefile still doesn't work - it is trying to link to libraries which are not available or configured differently on OSX I think.However, the scope of this question is too narrow for this site. I suggest you [contact Les directly](http://www.xjigmanager.com/contact-us-2.html) to try to resolve this issue.Thanks so much @Malife, I've used this feature quite a few times and it quite a few ways since you suggested it.  It rocks.  I just up-voted your answer and didn't accept it since it didn't technically answer the question.  I decided that since it is 99% of the way there and useful in so may other ways I would accept your answer.  Thanks again!I have the same problem. iTunes 10.1 for win works very well, on my mac doesn't work!!!Alex, can I ask where iClip gets its lyrics from?  Are they in any way offical, or from a user-submitted site which often have misheard and incorrect lyrics?I'm having the same issue - it seems to reset the playcount of songs that I've either skipped or only listen to half of before syncing.+1 for the "Must be here" :-) ... and because I found an answer to my questionSorry, I have no answer. However keep in mind, that message is to remind you that data is held in memory and not yet written to the disk. Which is particularly important when you switch often.Two plugs are for audio. Just leave those off, and I'm sure you'll get just video (the yellow one).I've done this a long time and I have never lost anything. I'm not saying it won't happen, but I'm willing to take the risk.Well, that stinks...but thanks for the quick answer.If I am not mistaken, iClip was pulling it's lyrics from specific set of sites on the internet. And if I remember correctly, people did not like this...The developer's blog/website explains what happened. (if it's still up)I found that I couldn't drag them from the Applications stack to the trash, I had to drag them via the desktop. Next time I will try dragging to the trash from the Applications folder in finder.A Firewire audio interface plugged in on startup will route the startup sound to the external device. I'm not sure if this works with USB audio....also, I'm not certain this is correct. Aside from the scenario in my above comment, muting the startup noise before shutting down will make the startup noise go away when restarting, no hardware required. I think my question should have been, How can you set the system to mute with a script?Thanks, I didn't realize that the System Profiler list did not include all extensions. What do I do to find the location of the `.kext` bundles on disk? There are some that I'm still looking for, and the bundle identifier is not always the filename. And does this list include only the currently loaded extensions or also those that can be loaded on demand? It's the latter group I most care about, since they might be needed in the future and won't show up as an error now.marking owc as the answer because it has the cheapest way to get my macbookpro4,1 up to 6GB and also has the most help for mac-based users specifically.I would address this problem by getting a hardware RAID device with removable hard-drives, and putting it into RAID1.  Then hot swapping the 2nd drive.well that royally sucksActually, MacBooks tend to have integrated graphics, which do not have separate VRAM - they do use the same RAM as everything else. Unfortunately, I don't believe there is a way to increase the RAM allotment.So upgrade then migrate? You can run migration utility after upgrading (in the utilities folder). Upgrade to 10.6.6 if you can- they've added some updates to migration.Thanks.Don't forget to accept your answer.See also: http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/Thanks, but I already did that (maybe my question was not clear). NSGod indicated that this is not the full list of loaded extensions, and indeed, I found extensions from Ambrosia and Parallels using his method that I did not see in the System Profiler list.Thanks for the answer but this only adds another Quit shortcut to Firefox. cmd+q still quits FirefoxHehe, that's the slowest way one can do it. It drove me absolutely insane!It's not easy at all.  It's insanely slow when you have many applications.I had previously tried this.  It's not working very well for me ... I prefer to either do it automatically (by the standard iTunes Apps categories) or to select an application to place it in a category rather than the opposite.If that is the case, what you typed didn't match the name of the command exactly. Try again, making sure that what you type in to System Preferences matches exactly the name of the command you see in the program (no quotes or anything).Interestingly, [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11/how-do-i-get-rid-of-the-start-up-sound-my-mac-makes) said that it wasn't possible.Oh. Now I see. Awkward wording :S@SeniorShizzle - thanks for your answer. As I mentioned, I bought it used, so I am not the original owner. And yes, it is older than 1 year, so warranty is not valid either.and yes, I tried a few combinations of computers, chargers, docks and cables - but nada!@Dori It's the time after Christmas, so new Macs or Cameras with SD Cards :) Although I would like to point out that my question specifically was asking about the Write Cache, which is what the warning is usually about (ignoring issue like Symlinks/open system files on the drive)I just re-ran this on a MBA (selected more languages this time). 1.3 GB were freed.I hear what you are saying, that you would rather take the chance on losing the memory stick, I just thought I would let you know that it does happen; I found this forum because I didn't eject my memory stick before disconnecting and wasn't able to access the 1.8gb worth of movies that I just took. Luckily Disk Utility was able to fix it, this time.@cate,@chrisparker2000: I converted your answers to comments.  I understand your positions, but the OP states in his question that he does not care about losing data. So in this case, the posts are really commentary and not answers to the question.First of all, I am anything but an apple "fanboy".  Second, I see only 2 questions here.  The first is "why did apple choose design implementation x?", which can not be answered except by a team of apple engineers.  The second is really just commentary on the first, disguised as a question ("how can I work around this design flaw?").also, see http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/246/non-answers-disguised-as-answers-and-non-questions-disguised-as-questionsDon't think it's possible.  Up for "go up one level," down for "go down one level."
Just get used to it.  You'll be fine, I'm sure.Furthermore, this actually *was* possible, until apple broke it, intentionally or not, in OS X 10.6. See  http://www.returnopen.com/How is this possible if, for example, you have more tabs than pixels?@dori if the Question would be associated with my account I could mark your answer as acceptedyou could also recreate the question which would allow us to merge the answers into it and give you ownership of it.recreated it at http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/6047/2336Can't be done.  And you should only get the warning if a disk is actually mounted, which leads me to believe you're not "just charging," even though you think you are.  You're still at risk.The disk is mounted, but if no data has been added/removed/etc (at least not any I care about / have asked to be transferred) doesn't that mean I'm not at risk?No.Is this also a problem when downloading something from a remote server?This doesn't work for me, I have to use Cmd+optionI'm accepting this as the answer because it addressed my _need_, rather than what I explicitly asked. Both answers here - this one and [Philip's](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6087/temporarily-disabling-the-startup-sound/6088#6088) - are good and to the point.@SeniorShizzle I agree. And there are too many "the's" in there. But maybe a simple comma would have clarified it.@chrisparker2000: I've never heard of a drive being physically destroyed by not ejecting it.  Where are you getting this information?  How does a memory stick become so "corrupt" that it can't be reformatted?Thanx for the associating, seems that this is or making the import by hand was the only solutionThe problem with this application is that my desktop is cluttered with folders and Files, so I wont be able to see iDeskCalDid you mean GUI->Servername/Settings/Service and then deactivate the softwareupdate Server?There are unique IDs of the disk beyond their mount point, so a link (ln) isn't sufficient.@vxjasonxv the stuff I found at the time I was messing with this suggested that the `pwd` and `find` commands I talked about in the question resolve the full path on systems other than OS X.  I haven't tested them though.and... the beta does it too.  not as often, but it does it.  and chrome's flash plugin crashes every hour or so. meh.@sugar: I'll try out 3.5, maybe that will fix it.G: good suggestion, I'll try that.awesome... works great!That checkbox will allow Server Admin to administrate the service. You'll need to select it in the outline view on the left and then disable it from there.When iChat works it's great, but I've found that it [tends to fail](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5337/unable-to-share-screen-over-ichat) exactly when you don't want it to.First test was buggy - deleted comment. Relaunch is a basic start in the right direction. It only opens Preview.app, none of the PDFs. It doesn't know anything about virtual desktops. But it has some potential.Agreed. mankoff, can you detail what is done a bit more before Spaces changes?mine seems to switch after about 1 second, which is too quickly. I never want it to switch this way at all. If I could set it to 10 seconds that would probably be OK.

I think the problem occurs like this: I drag something to the top (or side) and then spend 1 or 2 seconds fine-tune positioning it to the left/right (if at top) or up/down (if on side). During this fine-tune positioning, I keep it against the top (or side) and the switch occurs.

I just want this behavior to go away.Sorry for the poorly worded original question. Hover was the wrong word. I've edited it.Actually for some reason warp has no effect on my computer. I've logged out and back in but not rebooted, but I don't see why it would need a reboot.

I cannot get the behavior you have. The time slider doesn't have an effect (it is always about a second). Modifier keys don't do anything. Etc. Which is fine, I think, because I don't actually want to warp...It's Apple Remote Desktop, FYI.I believe this is the correct interpretation of the GPL.However, due to the DRM associated with the MAS it may run afoul of right 3, which is the sharing one. But an app that ignores the code signature and receipt (i.e., intentionally "piratable") may be in the clear. In any case, the MAS is not the same as the iAS. Also keep in mind that the original author can dual license. Using MAS license on the MAS and GPL on their own website.Thanks, but can you make the link with NSGod's answer? If I have a list of loaded kernel extensions from `kextstat`, how can I find where they are located on disk? And do you know how I can find "kernel extensions that *can* be loaded by the OS but currently are not"?@Nathan: no. As far as I see this problem is restricted to afp.2 months? If you haven't jailbroken it, send it back to Apple for repair. If you have jailbroken it, this is Apple's payback.The 8 GB could still have been 2G.totally agreed with you but problem is now my satellite teams worldwide do not have a mac machine of their own to work off on. macs are only just appearing on our network. im kinda the "assumed" mac specialist. am trying to handhold my guys of seasoned windows admins in deploying them. railroading and automating is my current strategy now - i do have plans to work with images once this batch of a few hundred macs (different make and models) have been deployed and my guys have been "elevated" in mac admin knowledge. thanks for you reply :)thanks nathan! you're a god sent! i glanced through the links and they seem the part. let me go down that avenue and report back. cheers!Works perfectly OMM. Not sure why it's not happening for you. Can you send a screen cap of those two menus?If it's any help, my IT crew keeps the disk image on a Firewire drive. You could conceivably duplicate a starter image onto other drives and send it to your satellite teams. My recommendation sounds like a lot of trouble, but it would be much easier than scripting in the long run. Scripts can break, especially with significant OS updates and 10.7 is in the works, they have to be fixed which would be you and you alone from the sounds of it whereas a disk image only needs to use Software Update, and anyone can do that on their own from anywhere.If your company is large enough to have international satellite teams, then it has the resources to make this happen. Your company needs to step up here and implement proper Mac support. Anything else is a major drain on productivity. I was in the same position you are in now so I'm speaking from experience.thanks Phillip. totally concur with ya - in fact i've made that very fact known to my management. now if only they could just get over the dollar signs and send me on a mac education tour bearing gifts (mac machines for admin use and fw drives)! :)Perfect. [extra chars]Or for MacBooks where to press F5 you have to press the Fn key as well, you could just use the Esc button. (This is cool though, thanks for bringing it to my attention :))Note that Skype now does offer video-on-phone.Doesn't work for me...Awesome, thanks! My `screen` is happy now :-)This answer isn't for the command line, so I'm including it as a comment.  Consider something like iStat menus for monitoring load average and other vitals monitoring (warning: this is a commercial app, and no I don't work for the developer).  It integrates some really nice graphical displays in the menubar for OSX: http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/ .looks like it works only for android devices?@Mankoff, what iOS version are you using? iPad or iPhone? It works for me on iPhone+iOS 4.1.iPhone iOS 4.0.1. I guess this is a feature added between 4.0.1 and 4.1.@sugar: 3.5 seems to be working.  apparently it's a some sort of bug that showed up in 3.6.  I'm going to follow up with this through mozilla's bug reporting.  If you switch your comment to an answer, I'll mark it as accepted.LogMeIn running on the Mac is amazingly fast.  VNC would be a second choice, but it's incredibly slow.  ARA is just as fast if not faster, but it's not free and to my knowledge limited only to Macintosh.Thanks @whaley, but I wanted this for the statusbar of [GNU screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), for when I SSH into my mac.thank, we already tried leaving it connected overnight and the day after, to no avail. I am not familiar with RecBoot, but given the PC does not even recognize it as connected, I don't see how a remote software tool can help here.@Time Machine - thanks, but I am not the original owner. It was bought used. Also, I do believe it was jailbroken by the original owner.@bahamat: It seems that enforcing the DRM is optional for MAS apps right now. Even if that changes, you can still install from the source code (bypassing the MAS), so the provisions of the GPL can be met, I believe.@calavera - Thank you for your appreciation. Sometimes, I feel afraid while putting answers, just because I get down-votes most of the times. :) :D :) :-) B-)I asked [a separate question about finding the file location of kernel extensions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6185/file-location-of-kernel-extensions).Always reset a computer or other device if you have bought it from someone who used it. Laptops, desktops, TVs, clock radios, iPods, everything.Wow. That's the airplay button alright! I've never seen it when I'm in an AppleTv'd network. Are you running 4.2.1? Is your AppleTV up to date?There's also a Jailbreak app called SpringSorter which will automatically sort by usage if you really hate organizing by hand, but of course Jailbreaking isn't for everyone. But as for non-Jailbreak, iTunes is the only organization available to you.Right now, no. Though I am sure there will be. AirPlay is still new and it will take a bit of time.Richard, if that's the solution, please add it as an answer and then accept it.Thank you. So as I understand, it does not matter which player I have as long as it can handle higher sound quality (192kbps and 320kbs).Thanks for the clarification. I wonder if my MacBookPro2,2 manages to charge it off either ports, system info says it both requires and uses 500 mA. And I don't have a charger either, could my iPad have toasted the old iPhone charger (not the slim type, same shape as iPad charger...)What I need is simply a bulk 220V->USB transformer, there simply are too many devices which require it now. Because Apple devices are not doing any particular tricks, are they? They should be able to use any charger providing sufficient amperage? We've had some challenges in the car...After a few search, it might be a duplicate. I'll let the mod decide. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/3697Works great, thanks. Is there any way I can turn off the MacBook screen off? I have connected my Magic Mouse and external keyboard, but when I close the lid, it just puts the system to sleep.@Darth Did you try to set the luminosity of the screen to a minimum? It doesn't affect the external screen and the lowest setting is pretty much black.That's certainly a good advice, but does it have something to do with this unfortunate situation?That works great, as the lowest luminosity turns the screen off. The only problem I see now is that it seems a little laggy, not sure if that's normal or because the laptop screen is still on.@Darth what seems laggy? The whole computer? It didn't happened when the main screen was the macbook?Lots of programs will connect the mic in to the speakers. Try Audacity http://audacity.sourceforge.net/Do you just want to play music from the phone, or sound from apps? The original question said "app", but has been removed in an edit. There is a major difference between the two.Not a dupe IMO.I suggest breaking this up into two questions, as you can tell you're having to repeat one in the comments to an answer below...I don't have an apple tv so it shouldn't be there at all!!That doesn't always work. Sometimes it kept my apps in the folders, sometimes not, and apps not in folders are on the correct pages but the order is incorrect. At that point, I decided not to sweat the layout of my apps so much.With recent MacOSX versions, you don't need a separate VNC client anymore -- you can just hit cmd-K and then do "vnc://address-of-computer/" to control it.This seems like a Windows question - maybe it should be migrated to Super User?I can confirm that Firefox (3.6) does not remove the cmd-q shortcut, the System Preference shortcut is added, but the default is *not* removed.Interestingly, my cheap-o powered USB hub does not seem sufficient, and even though they are identical in dimensions, the old iPhone and new iPad charger are not the same, the latter is 2.1 A (50W) and the old one is a seemingly insufficient 1 A.Granted, this is non-standard behaviour, as most other applications will indeed disable the standard shortcut.I realize you probably posted this because you don't have enough reputation, but in the future this sort of response to someone else's question is best left as a comment.True, if you're talking about App Store-ready apps. However, the op asked whether it's possible on a *jailbroken* phone.I have not encountered the issue again since implementing this solution. I am confident that it is a winner :-)This doesn't work for me either.In UK Virgin Mobile is on T-Mobile and is GSM so will it work in UK?I've tried all softwares mentioned here so far. TeamViewer is great but I prefer logmein. Both are great, it's just a matter of taste I suppose. At least on the free versions.@mankoff - The original said, "music from an iPHONE app" and "music from the app." After your changes and mine, it now says, "iPhone's audio" and "music from the iPhone." What's the difference? My own take: musical output from an iPhone *is* audio output, and given that an app is required for an iPhone to produce audio, all iPhone audio output (musical or otherwise) can be assumed to be via an app.He said rack... Heh hehThe difference can be seen in the answers below. Music (that could be played through the iPod app) can be played through the USB connector cable and iTunes. Music/sounds from a game require a different solution.@Thilo but because you have to have validly "purchased" it from the MAS you're denied the right to share/redistribute. The GPL isn't only about source code, it covers four freedoms which all must be met.Lots of alternatives: http://alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-paint/?platform=macCould the downvoter please explain your issue with my answer?This is actually the best answer. Funny how things turned out here.@bahamat: Does it say that anywhere? The MAS does not preclude you from offering alternate distribution channels, and to satisfy the GPL source distribution requirement a link to a publicly accessible website is fine. So if your app includes (in its About page) a link to a web page where the full source code can be obtained, that should be fine. There could even be binary packages, too, although I don't think that would be necessary.Dual licensing is only an option if all copyright holders agree to it, which is probably difficult unless a single person or company holds all rights to the source. In the VLC case, that would not have worked.I am in no way an audiophile or have equipment that can manifest the differences, but when the original Shuffle came out, reviewers said that it offered the best audio quality of the whole iPod line, so I think the chips in the device do matter to some extent (although, yes, your speakers/headphones will have a bigger impact).If you're using OS X server, you can use RADIUS to limit access by MAC address.thank you very much...I will probably also go with the classic, I like it the most... Thanks for help.Well, now I know I have to find some cool headphones;)No problem. I am really happy with mine. It's amazing technology.I am a big fan of Sennheiser's headphones, both in-ear and over-the-ear. I used to sell high-end audio and they do a really good job with the design and construction. They have a neutral sound that I really like. I also have some of Bose's $100 in-ear, and prefer the Sennheisers over them too.Going another route now...http://serverfault.com/questions/220974/bind9-dns-ubuntu-names-pingible-on-server-but-not-on-windows-machinesVirgin Mobile is completely separate companies in different countries, usually a joint venture (or that countries' legal system's similar construct) between Virgin Group (or a local subsidiary) and the target cell carrier (Sprint in the US, T-Mobile in the UK). I felt it safe to assume that the asker was US-based as they referenced AT&T.Yes, it is physically possible on Virgin Mobile UK assuming they usually handle GSM phones.If it is jailbroken, why not just open the phone through your file browser and retrieve the files?`kextfind` is interesting, but it seems it only searched in the standard `/System/Library/Extensions/` folder. Is there a way to find the location of bundles that were not loaded from this folder? Something that remembers the `-r` parameter of `kextutil`?Yes, I know about that, but I wanted something automated and the "Readibility" bookmark as posted by Dori is absolutely bombastic, since it Safari Reader doesn't work on all sites.Wow, the Readability is absolutely awesome! Thanks DoriIs it HD though?SoudHound seems a lot faster than Shazam. Will start to try to match a song even before the full capture. It also identified songs that Shazam didn't. And SoundHound's free version allows unlimited matches, while Shazam allows 5 per month.You can achieve the same effect without using TinkerTool by entering this string `defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES` in the terminal.+1. I hate those fat adapter dongles hanging off the MacBook. I can live with an adapter, but it should be hidden away behind the back of the monitor.Thanks for the info. I've filed a bug at https://bugreport.apple.com .  I suggest everyone else with this problem do so too :)can you provide or some reference regarding this?  thanks in advanceIf you have an Apple Store around, it might be worth giving them a hands-on with it. There are a variety of other solutions, from resetting your ACL's to adjusting the network name (ie. Richards-Mac-Mini.local) that might fix it. Reinstalling the OS from the Snow Leopard CD will default to an Archive & Install option, which will attempt to preserve the User data while rebuilding the OS. I'd opt for that before considering a complete erase.Nice find, Cawas. As for daefu, syncing via Dropbox is great if you have a library that fits within the size limits of their service. If you're on the same network, then Home sharing might be more appropriate: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3819Well, strictly speaking, it's less "allow" and more "changed the implementation and nobody's figured out how to hack it yet".Firefox is a memory hog. you have to close and re-open frequently. BTW, you have 1.71 GB is in 'inactive' state. That means, it's still available for usage.Also, can you please post the entire Activity Monitor screen shot, sorted by Real Memory? so that we can tell which program using more RAM@garik I know firefox use memory a alot, but with these open software before I use around 2GB of memory, and also fire fox just use 220MB real memeory and 150MB VM in this screen shot :(I uninstall most of my Adobe application too last weak :) but I think I problem somewhere else.Is this a screen shot of AM on a fresh reboot?Ouch. Do you have any directory scanning applications running, like McAfee? I think you are in for some trial and error here. To the comments to the questions, browsers in general take up a lot of RAM as well, and they more or less maintain a connection. Anything internet-related is going to take up RAM as well.Dori, I see that you closed this as an exact duplicate, when in fact the question is more specific than simply entering symbols, rather my question has to do with the ability to input Unicode characters without the assistance of some other app. For example, the Mac OS allows a user to type ALT + 4-digit-hex if the keyboard is set to "Unicode Hex Input". Would you please reopen it since an answer might address multilingual concerns not limited copy/paste symbols? Thank you!Please do not simply link to another article.@philip no it's notkyle I know this one too but I think I use RAM more than usual I want a solution to tell me what process run on my system(and tell each process blongs to what application) and how much RAM they exactly use.Thanks for your answer, I'm actually after funny mnemonics to help people remember obscure shortcuts (see the above example) rather than how to remember shortcuts.Just as an FYI - I am an IT technician and so I probably run more stuff in the background than the average user.  Now I don't know what 'type' of user you are, but I found that from the get go, my top-of-the-line MBP i7 was maxed out at 4GB.  Same situation as you - some free ("inactive") RAM was all I had, and it was almost always down to 1GB or less.  I upgraded to 8GB for less than $200 and haven't looked back since.  A very worthy upgrade, especially if you run virtual machines.Also - it took a while to get used to Chrome, but now I love it.  Tiny footprint, remembers my tabs without having to use an extension, and (speaking of which,) extension installation/removal doesn't require restarting the browser.  What's not to like?Andy Ihnatko of the Chicago Suntimes noted that there was no official response when asked about an antenna redesign.  Glad to see that ArsTechnica tested it out :)are both the iPhone and iTunes signed into the same iTunes account?@Philip Would it be good to copy & paste it here ? No offense to @Kyle's answer.... and I don't think so it deserves to be down voted ..Good point, you'll definitely know it when it happens with Expose.

The only documented pattern seen at large by users has been centric to AT&T customers.When I insert a disk (DVD or CD; I've tried a couple of each), the drive spins up, and (it sounds like) moves the laser back and forth a few times, then ejects the disk. I haven't tried blank media.I have to admit the DDD app does the bare minimum I needed. I recently gave up on getting a good solution and just bought it. I hate apple so much mor for such an app even needing to exist! While it does not solve my problem nor answer my question properly, I'll avvept this as only available option and as yet another appreciation token for such a great answer. ;)I love it! But I **guess** I could live without it... :Pyou should try **JumiOne**, tho I think it's still windows only.If known-good media doesn't work, blank media may respond appropriately, but it's a rarity.

Question edited to show additional infoSee note 2, in this article: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1519. A cycle is a full discharge and recharge of the battery capacity, but you can have recharges in the middle of the cycle. So, it isn't necessary to use the battery to the end every time. But it is good to exercise the battery, so keeping it plugged all the time will diminish its life.Probably the info in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3455/use-adapter-or-battery-macbook-pro-or-macbook/3473#3473 can help youHow old is your MacBook Pro? Which year/model is it?Nothing known would be concrete. The features of Apple products are only *known* when *announced*. But I doubt they would use a third-party keyboard. Instead, they would improve their own or create a new one.3 days old. I have used it for just a few hours so far.@Ipacheco - yes, that is Apple's official stance.  In real-world use, though, and as an IT tech, my experience (which may not reflect your experience..) has been that reducing cycle count by leaving it plugged in as much as possible, reduces battery fade over time.  With regards to the cycle itself; yes, I know what the definition of a cycle is.  I was merely pointing out that a cycle is not necessarily something that happens all at once.  You can drain and charge 50% twice (equaling 100%...) and still be reduced one cycle.  Doesn't have to be in the same sitting...Is it a 15" or 17"?  If its smaller than 17", take it back.  I have heard that the jump from 15" to a 17" diminishes battery life drastically.. and that's why they don't allow you to upgrade to an i7 on the 17".  The battery wouldn't be able to handle it for very long at all.  I imagine you're not doing video editing or anything like that, which would be super intense for the machine?@Harv 15 inch Macbook Pro with i5. I was watching videos on how to write Xcode.Assuming the videos were in a web page as opposed to iTunes, it's an Adobe Flash issue, which burns battery like crazy. If you watch YouTube videos you can enable HTML5 there and the power use will be about half. If you were watching videos in iTunes or QuickTime, take your MacBook to an Apple store, there's something wrong.@Mark http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140277(v=office.10).aspxAh. I was watching the Stanford Xcode videos in iTunes. I guess a trip to the Apple store is warranted.Or at least a dedicated Swype text editor app (if a system-wide keyboard is not possible).@Kyle: When I make the attachment from the mail app then it sends fine.

TM doesn't show up on mine. Trying another backup now to see if it appears.No, it is a 5400 rpm drive. I believe the heat and vibration buildup I experienced with the Seagate was because of the higher rpm. No 5400 rpm drive has given me these issues.I don't know if I can really "recommend" any of the options at this point -- they all kinda suck.  Any of the overwrite options will use up the drive's lifetime write limit, and tend to increase fragmentation and decrease performance.  The best thing would be for Apple to add ATA-secure-erase (i.e. the controller-based option) as an option in Disk Utility, but who knows when/if that'll happen.Any idea how the DisplaySerialNumber field in the file "com.apple.windowserver.plist" relates to the serial number as found on the display itself? I've managed to find my display's serial number in an old e-mail to Apple support, and I've also found entries for the display in the file. The two numbers do look somewhat similar, but they're not exactly the same. (For one, the real serial number contains digits and letters, while the field in the file only has digits. Some digits appear in one that are not in the other.)Sorry to hear it. I guess it strips alpha characters for efficiency. The reason for it to keep the number is just so that it knows which display to put a window on, and I guess it doesn't need the whole thing to keep it straight.Still no TM on mine.Development of chmox appears to have ceased since 2005.

It has several aspects to it, but those aspects are not obvious to people who might have this question.  It makes sense to address several angles on this question in one answer.

I just tried opening that file in a text editor and replacing all occurrences, saving, and opening iPhoto.  However, the text was still present in the photo descriptions.  As I closed iPhoto, it re-wrote that file and the text was back.  I also see the text present in a file called Properties.apdb, but when I tried to edit that iPhoto said the library had become corrupt and needed to be restored from backup (so I restored that file from a copy I'd made first).Do you suppose that a database (to temporarily store metadata) combined with a spotlight importer (to pull the metadata from the previous DB) would work?

BTW, apparently you can add a finder spotlight comment with `xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment "commenthere" filename` and it'll get indexed as the kMDItemFinderComment attribute.i was just a few seconds behind :) +1Thanks, @mankoff, +1. So, it sounds like there *are* options. Do you know if TomTom, Navigon, etc. have monthly subscription fees? Verizon's "VZ-Navigator", which has audible turn-by-turn, voice recognition, traffic info, etc. costs $10/month, which is reasonable with a $15 data plan--but not so reasonable when you have to upgrade to a $30 smartphone data plan.Thanks, @Intuition, +1. I have an LG Dare, which is not a true smartphone (it can do mobile browsing and email, but it's very slow and there aren't many apps for it). Really the only app I've downloaded for it is VZNavigator. I'm looking to do a major upgrade here, though. I use Outlook and GMail, and need to be able to sync with those (including calendar). Other must-haves, besides turn-by-turn nav, are a fast browser and good touch-screen QWERTY keyboard (the Dare's has no error correction whatsoever). Games and video calling would be great, too.Which 'obscure shortcuts' are you looking for? General Mac, or something more specific like Photoshop? If you post a list of commands you want mnemonics for, it will be easier to help.Don't use outlook so not 100% sure about that, but it works perfectly with GMail. Of course, you can sync all of the accounts with IMAP anyway so hopefully that shouldn't be much of an issue.

There are about a zillion games available for iOS so I'm sure you'll find something to entertain yourself. I'm quite a Doodle Jump fan myself.

Good luck!Thanks...whatever I get is gonna be way better than what I have now.Well, then, It's time to turn this into 5 smaller shows in iPhoto, origami each one, export, import into imovie, and add music.You can sync with an Exchange server, if that's what you're asking. If you mean Outlook generically, if it's syncing with your system calendar then you should be fine.AT&T's offering has monthly fees, but none of the others do, as far as I know. Navigon, which I use, definitely does not.I believe this option is only available if your Mac has been synced with an iPhone, otherwise it doesn't let you sync with Google. Not 100% sure, though.just google limera1n then -> latest version should really workHey All, added an update that hopefully clarify things a bit!Ha, brilliant. Kids will love it.nice answer, thank you (and +1).One question on that link...any reason any of those navigators (besides the AT&T one) wouldn't work on the Verizon CDMA iPhone?Nuts. Forgot to make it wiki. Can a mod do that please?It already is, all answers to wiki questions are automatically made wikiI have both a Matias Tactile Pro and an Apple Extended Keyboard II. There's no comparison; the Matias was clearly designed by someone who'd only heard third-hand reports of the wonders of the AEKII and never seen (much less used) one himself. I hated that thing with a passion that only grew over time, and was thrilled when I got a Griffin iMate so I could go back using the best keyboard any company has ever made. Oh, and Matias also has horrible customer support as well. Do Not Recommend.I appreciate the suggestion. I spent about 45 minutes with OmniGraffle a couple of months ago, trying to make the type of simple diagram I'm talking about. Unfortunately I found it to often be counterintuitive and/or in the way. I've not managed to figure out how to, for example, **not** have *a shadow appear on every shape I draw*, a shadow that I have to manually remove. I grew accustomed to copying and pasting shapes that I'd removed the shadow from (along with other default formatting), and realize that with enough effort could make my own template, but why should I for $100?@Matthew - would [this](http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=4407) or [this](http://forums.omnigroup.com/showthread.php?t=7697) solve the problem?@Dori Tested it, and unfortunately that doesn't change what what shapes from templates do, just ones you draw yourself, so you can't have identically-sized boxes, easy access to basic shapes, etc. That I can tell, anyway. Thanks for the suggestion!I didn't know that you had to use an email address instead of a username. When did that change?basically, there are some annoying folders with tonnes of emails coming in which i really should convert to digests, but I digress. I don't want notifications for these folders, only for a select few. And while growl can be invoked that way, I will have to somehow disable all notification and then add this logic and rules for each folder, am I right?Essentially, yes.I'm pretty sure his first sentence, "I don't have home contents cover," is UK-speak for not having that insurance, though I'm not certain.The real question is why aren't you using opera on the mac. Opera is way more powerful than safari.@ohmantics You can choose to have GrowlMail only show notifications for Inbox (Mail > Preferences > GrowlMail > Only notify for emails in your Inbox).Mail rules only run on mail that is in the Inbox. If you are moving the messages on the client side (in Mail.app) you could add the Growl notification (via AppleScript) there, if your mail is filtered on the server then this will not work.that worked! wow. elegant solution. Thank youyup, that is what I am using nowYup, I am doing server side filtering. What i was wondering was if there was a way to filter messages in growl based on text, cause the subjects have folder names. That could be a way of doing this. Maybe I should ask a separate question@Dori: you're making me curious about the authentic AEKII -- might try hunting one down.When does this start? Does it seem to be triggered as soon as you turn on the computer, or is it when you open a certain application?Growl doesn't have the kind of filtering you're looking for. Adding one rule per folder name in Mail.app isn't that complicated. Once you make one rule that works the way you want, you can just duplicate it and edit the new folder name in.There is also a tab on the Preferences called Shell.  If you change the 'When the shell exits:' to 'close if the shell exited cleanly' it will do this without any scripting at all.With the last update the TOS changed. It was strange.It was linked to the same email address. The apps don't seem to recognize this.Yep that's right @MatthewTo name one thing: Almost all gaming mice and keyboards are not Mac compatible, or at least not all the way (especially macros).Hmmm, Apple software on Windows question. I guess the "Apple Software" part defines the fact that you posted it here?Altough this about Apple software, you might have better luck posting on Super User.@VxJaxonxV, I post here because people on the Apple stack are more likely to have experience with Bonjour than people on the SuperUser stack.  One of the current top Bonjour questions on SuperUser is "Do I need this software for any reason?"You don't find their control center software a little clunky? I have the RX Revolution, and while I LOVE the mouse, I think their control panel is extremely awkward to work with. I feel pretty much exactly the same about their Harmony One universal remote I just bought. GREAT device, CRUMMY setup software UX.I only use it once to set things up, then mostly ignore it. It's functional, like most of Apple's control panels.@Thomas L Holaday - This is indeed Apple software however, the error itself is probably in some way related to the Windows OS.  Did you try re-installing?  Apparently Win 7 is much better about permissions however, I saw this a tonne on XP/Vista, and usually the process was not running with the right credentials.  Also; are there any entries about it in the event log?Thanks, that's cool, I can filter the "noise" this way and focus on more interesting things.This is an usability killer, Apple should be more realistic and allow people to disable the voicemail functionality. Too ofter I press it my mistake.@David - Nathan's suggestion is great.  Try closing iPhoto, replacing the text, and then rebuilding the iPhoto library, by holding option while you launch iPhoto..I've never been able to get Mail.app to use the Exchange account that Google provides for mobile device use. Any chance they're using Google?@David - Oops.  I meant cmd-option, not option.Awesomeness costAre you an admin on that computer?I recommend Omnigraffle. It is a maddening program out of the box, with all of the defaults configured to please one of the old gods from the Cthulhu Mythos by HP Lovecraft, but it is possible to configure them sensibly. The ones in Preferences are easy to find, but the tricky bit is how to figure out how to set the defaults on drawing: click on the toolbar icon of choice with the option key down, so that Omnigraffle lets you set the desired default properties using the inspectors without having to create a graphic object first.Voted to close due as this "question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet."The above file is a photo, with a description that I added from within iPhoto.At $99/year, it costs as much as Omnigraffle and does less. Yes, there's a free version, but that only allows one project.I take it you've tried http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6438/remove-specific-text-from-multiple-descriptionsIf it's not jailbroken currently (and if it's a brick Apple can't tell anyway) Apple will still fix it at the Apple Store if you can get to one close to you.@Nathan In fact, I was trying to answer that question, that's how I figured out where/how the metadata was stored.  Now I am curious as to how one edits it myself..  and I will point the author of that question over this way if someone has a solution.  :-)Also, and this might not work. You can try booting the device into recovery mode. Leave the ipod plugged into the wall for a couple hours on a charger you KNOW works. Plug the charger into the mac, then hold the HOME button (NOT the power button or any other buttons) and slide the charger into the iPhone while still keeping the home button pressed for at least one minute. If after that time it doesn't work, try again. If not still, Apple store.You mean how to edit the XML files, or how to get your changes to stick?@SeniorShizzle - OK, I'll try - but I assume this works for a Windows computer as well? If not, then I need to find a MAC first... (BTW, it's an iPod, not iPhone, but again, I assume the procedure should be the same?)Unfortunately, with headphones plugged in there is no option for internal. Pic here:http://twitpic.com/3qyvse/fullA nuts! You know what? I use it with a Firewire-based soundcard -- not the headphone jack. I never plug headphones in to the headphone jacks on my Macs...@ysap As long as you have iTunes running it should work the same. It should also work on an iPod and iPhone. It's funny because I actually switched to iPhone half way through the post ;)@Nathan G. Neither.  The description field in iPhoto actually edits the file metadata (as shown above).  The data stored inside that xml file I believe is just iPhoto caching the metadata.  Reading the info in from the XML file is obviously faster than recursively going through what could be thousands of photos and reading the metadata from each.@SeniorShizzle - OK, thanks. I'll try the procedure sometime in the next days and will post the results.seems that I found an other databases where they collect all sort of app keys http://code.google.com/p/manifestdestiny/iMovie hasn't  been updated for a while, but it isn't obsolete if you want to make a DVD. Just wait out the beachballs (that works OMM).Did you mean 'idvd ...' rather than 'imovie ...'?Also, idvd starts by bringing up a screen in which I to select from a menu of irrelevancies. What do I pick?@Nathan iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand were all updated in the last interation of iLife, iDvd and iWeb were not.have you tried signing out then signing back in with your iTunes account?and from iosnoop's man page, iotop is even better! thanks!!There's no sane pattern I've found yet. When I posted this this morning I had woken up the system about 45 min prior and had the same dozen or so processes running that had been running for days. It seems to happen about every 3 or 4 days, I'll comment on what it is once I catch it with Gordon's solution.In that case your best bet is emailing support@apple.com and seeing if they can't link the purchases to your email address. It's kind of a silly system they have set up for it though.Yup, I meant that iDVD hadn't been updated. My bad.@bmargulies: Which irrelevanceis might these be?@cabbey I hadn't noticed iotop before; thanks for the pointer.My Razer Mouse also works well, even without the drivers installed.Is this a problem when playing music from your computer?While LSOF is great for some things, like why can't I unmount/eject this media, it's not so useful here. Showing me what files are OPEN is pointless, there's thousands of open files at all times. I need to know what ones are being read/written to.Did you look at the tags:-)@Nat e.g. 'the instant option' which goes directly from camera to DVD. It should just be engaging with what's arriving from iMovie, and instead it's discussing with me whether i want to do something else entirely.Please provide some more info taken from the Event Log of Windows, otherwise this is virtually impossible to diagnose.@Nathan this happens when I am playing it on my iPhone@mummey question edited to add infoPlaying video does not skip. The same song again has not skipped either.Interesting, about how far (in seconds) does it get before it starts skipping?You're using the Share-> Send to iDVD option?Both times it happened, it was toward the end of the song. Then I replayed the song.. no skipping!The 10.6.x install discs can actually do an in-place downgrade from a newer version of 10.6.x; no wipe-and-install needed.  I don't know if it will be possible to downgrade from 10.7.x to 10.6.x this way, although I would guess not.The song length long or short? (a thought that maybe its somehow being played back faster than it can be read into memory.)Also, Windows 7 drivers have, in my limited PC experience, worked with Vista, as long as it was the same version, either 32 or 64 bit.One last suggestion: Maybe somehow the song is fragmented in flash memory (I don't think that should be an issue though). In any case, maybe try backing up your current contents on the iPhone, Restoring the iPhone using an image of the current iOS version, then applying the backup to get your data back on it.  Hopefully that should be enough to get it to behave correctly.@Harv: Didn't seem to work.  I tried cmd-option when opening iPhoto after editing the XML file, which presented me with a few options for rebuilding the library.  I kept the default, which is a "repair."  But at the end of the repair, it said the library "was in use by another process" and had become unreadable.  iPhoto exited, and upon re-starting it the text was still present.  Thoughts?@David - I have found out that the metadata is not stored in that file, but in the photo files themselves.  Editing that metadata is turning out to be a challenge as well!  See my Apple Stack Exchange question here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6525/editing-iphoto-specific-metadata - this is what we need to do to your photo(s) in order to make the changes stick.Wow.  Nice catch.  I certainly wouldn't do this to my own system, but it's nice to know it can be done.  I suppose the app could be replaced with an empty file.Is it possible with the new firmware? I thought there was something special that you had to do.@Nat yes, but I didn't pre-launch iDVD.@Martin, the event log contains only informational messages from Bonjour; I added them to my question.@Harv, I did not want to reinstall blindly, and since the error message contained a searchable string (mDNSResponse.exe) I wanted to get the answer into Apple Stack Exchange.+1. It's *so* nice not being the only BBEdit fan (for once).it's fine I found the perfect company on a a different Apple forum.Sorry - I know my answer doesn't directly answer the question. It would be safe to assume it's part of the Software Update Daemon's checking / updating process. Try checking the Console Log (Console.App) for any entries made by Google apps.I think Activity Monitor is useless -- I also need to know what is going on with this I/O stuff. Apple can surely come up with something more than Activity Monitor to tell me what is going on with my MacPRO (10.6.6). I did buy MacScan and found that it stopped a lot of activity in the form of spyware...something to consider...I configure MacScan to run every 24 hrs at midnight. Now I am no longer losing bandwidth under my Hughesnet Satellite limitations.I accidentaly push that button sometimes as well, and my mobile service provider (from whom I do not have a voicemail service) is always more than happy to charge me call fees.+1 BBEdit is the only thing I use for non-Cocoa programming. Of the posters requests, the only thing it doesn't have is Git integration.@Nathan, which version of iCal are you using? The instructions on the link you provided do not seem to tally with my version of iCal (snow leopard).  Will give it another go tho.The problem with this is that I dont believe that you can sync the calendars with a blackberry.  Might have to resort to a shared account tho.Great idea!!.....sorry I couldn't up vote since i dont have 15+ votesok!!!! Great answers.......but no one has talked about upgrading to 3.1 version..actually buying!!Cool idea.........I will follow thoroughly!! great...FYI, in the same vein than mp3gain batch editing, i wrote an Automator action that I use to automatically compute Replay gain for my incoming mp3 files. Check it here : https://github.com/KraYmer/MacMP3Gain-Automator-ActionI don't think iOS devices allow disk use, I believe that was only for the original iPod linethis is really disappointing...Fair enough - but I think that Macros and extra buttons fall under the esoteric functions mentioned in my comment. :)  I wouldn't expect those to work in Windows without installing specific drivers.@Harv: I may be close to something useful here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4708418/applescript-syntax-for-iphoto-automation+1 for Mobile Mouse ProFinally had the error occur again and tried your suggestion. Browsing by IP address works but browsing by name doesn't. Again, Firefox works fine for both, and 'host yahoo.com' from the terminal resolves the name correctly. Any ideas on how to fix, or further things to look at?I have also got this way working with iCal on Snow Leopard (although I do not have a Mobile Me account). Myself & my partner both have Google accounts and can view/edit eachothers calendars, online, on iPhone, iCal and Android (probably meany more options too, but that's what we use).Now that you mention it, I did remove all songs from my iPhone recently because I needed the space for video recordings. I just put them all back in. This started happening after the reload.It's really annoying isn't it. Pretty much the only reason I jailbreak is for Rotation Inhibitor.If you read the comments on that post, the program on Cydia is called "Rotation Inhibitor"Thanks, added to the answer.I've made the best results with a $4.00 iPhone App called Perfect OCR.This is for a non-shared calendar, so I need to use the export to .ics version.@Carmine That's quite an assumption you make there. I'm an academic and enjoy using TeX myself, but the majority of my colleagues are very uncomfortable with it, both in concept and in practice.This is an exemplary community wiki. Thanks to everyone involved.I was disappointed that Apple didn't make this lock to the current orientation. It is simple and would make the built-in functionality much more useful.Ok, follow-up question: how can I complain to Apple/file a bug and not be ignored? The customer relations experience with Apple is as frustrating as with no other tech enterprise. I really wonder why I even still bother. >:-(A "code point" aka "code position" are just the technical terms used by unicode.org http://unicode.org/glossary/ Basically its the same thing as a unique ID, but specifically integer. The most common encoding I've worked with represents code points in hexidecimal.Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm hoping there's a different, perhaps more technical way to natively enter via some keyboard combination a hexadecimal or some such format to output characters in the basic multilingual plane, and perhaps in the Unicode code space beyond.thanks, singing out and in worked. It let me confirm my details then. I don't if i'm supposed to do anything to show that your answer is right (i'm new)Thank you! Worked perfectly.Would this be also applicable for aluminium cases of the late MBP? (If so, the question could then be enlarged and address much more people)@LudoMC indeed, this cleans lots of surfaces, including wood, keyboards, mice, everything. My Iphone 1st GEN screen, the 3GS too. Using pure alcohol is a bad idea, but this 7-3 proportion makes it excellent. That's in my experience.@Konrad Customer experience is a unique experience for every customer. Apple has a very high degree of satisfaction (as opposed to other tech companies). However your specific "bug" is related to a design decision in the way the store is designed, perhaps due to copyright stuff and simplicity. Encoding another language would require more space, bandwidth, etc. I know what you mean, but I understand Apple. I just hope they will give us the choice to change the language one day. Where to complain is hard to say, you can try steve@apple.com ;)Consider adding RAM. It might be cheaper in time and money than buying other software and learning how to use it.@g I imagine this is because the iPhone does not have a landscape home screen (or phone, or calendar, or maps, or iTunes, or ...) orientation. It would lock landscape applications, say Safari, to landscape and you would need to rotate the iPhone every time you close and open the application. Portrait is the iPhones native orientation, unlike the iPad which doesn't really have a native orientation and thus locking to current mode makes more sense.I'll add my response as an answer then you can check the checkmark.  Thanks, glad it worked.@martin - Or a faster computer... I ran it on a dummy account because I got impatient waiting for the results on my account!Is that the right pdf? Page 27 just has instructions for resetting a time capsule.Great because if you use it on your iPhone or iPad it will also sync read tweets in your timeline.I like LastPass a lot, I just wish it had a more polished UI like 1Password.Revised answer above. Hope this solves it!Cool! Is there a way to fix the words that the keyboard learned "wrongly", or do I have to reset the dictionary?After switching to chrome a while ago, I've noticed it still has trouble with two things:  CPU usage with HD flash video, and ASP driven interfaces (and other Microsoft languages).Deleting the .Spotlight-V100 folder and adding that drive to the System Prefs > Spotlight > Privacy list seems to have helped. I'll check if this works again on my other slow drive.Not sure. I'd ask this as an independent question.Are you actually trying to do anything with Bonjour?  Like print from win->mac or mac->win?  iTunes?  I try to avoid using Bonjour if I can -- it is unreliable in my experience.  I usually go by IP as much as I can.If it's worked, great.  I'm not sure though if preventing the TM drive from being indexed properly is a good idea though.  I suppose once the initial backup is done you could remove the drive from the privacy list and allow it to re-build the index.Thanks Nivas, that's a shame.I've done it on three different macs with no issues, although most of the time I just unmount things as well.I don't imagine Steve will be checking his email for a while...Just to clarify, you mean the music stutters, but keeps playing on the same song? Can you tell me if your phone is jailbroken?Excel is hugely more powerful (Pivot tables for a start), but it, and it's output, is nowhere near as pretty as Numbers.Evernote *looks like* such a good alternative, but it doesn't seem to have specific To Do functions and the iPhone version is a bit Fisher Price. Things does exactly what it says it does, reliably and professionally, but cloud sync is waaaaay overdue.RAM is all maxed out :-)Make sure the firmware is bang up to date. Mine wasn't and was slow, but got faster since then.USB is a slow connection in any case. Is it a lot worse when attached to the Time Capsule than it is attached directly to your computer with USB?    Also, is speed a problem when using the Time Capsule's internal drive?What firmware? OS X System Software? OS X EFI updater? I keep up-to-date however Software Updater tells me to, so AFAIK this isn't the issue.I think this is a good question; just because it doesn't apply to you, doesn't mean it is too localised ;-).Do u know of any 3rd party cables that are less expensieve?The Griffin A/V is the same, and $35. http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/a-v-cablesAlso worth mentioning that both of these come with an AC adapter.i dont think the griffin one is compatible with the iphone.I think that it probably is. They may have not updated their specs yet (iPod Touch stops at G3, and there's no reason for that to change). However, it may not be worth the $5 to risk it.If your MacBook is old and has specific defect stains, you might be able to get the case replaced: http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2006/07/4508.ars (but not if it's just dirty!)It's when accessing the TC's own internal drive over Wi-FiLet's start with; what are you trying to do?yeah i guess your right. thnx.Indeed it would.  Thank you for tracking that down.  I did find the .plist files, but I did not find any console log entries for Google apps.  I plan to keep looking.Not a good idea?

Check your settings in Parallels (or try VirtualBox). Personally, all-Mac would be a nicer solution, so I hope a good answer is posted below. But slow shouldn't be an issue if you can fit 8GB in.@ipacheco From my experience, english auto complete and auto correction is pretty good. Portuguese is not at all and really a hateful feature. I'd like to have it turned on for english only but since I can't I just turn it off.I can say Redsn0w is indeed the tool to do it. For the rest, hope you find an answer.@mankoff 3GB max in my C2D 15" 2.16GHz says otherworldcomputing... even virtual box with xp slows me way downThanks. Is there a link on apple site describing this? I can't find nothing about.Time Machine makes heavy use of Spotlight to determine which files need to be backed up.I don't believe this is documented, but you can see for yourself. Once you plug it in to charge, you'll see the lightning bolt icon in the battery. That means it's charging. Notice that it stays there even during heavy use. You can also try plugging it in with the battery partly empty, then using it for a while (a half hour, to be safe). Once you unplug it, the battery level will be higher.That will only count files you have access to read. Add sudo for a true count, especially if you are measuring outside your home folder.Thanks for the tip about LogMeIn, wasn't aware they had a free versionI know ARD has screen sharing, but I'm wondering if it works over the InternetYes, with a VPN or open ports on the firewall. http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1882Just to make sure I understood you correctly... are you saying that I can install the full version of Vista, then upgrade it to Windows 7?What kind of problems are you referring to? Is it just problems during the upgrade process itself? Or will there be problems in the resulting operating system after the upgrade process (e.g. it will be unstable, slow, buggy, etc.)?How old is the MacBook? Was the port on a keyboard/hub?Its a Macbook Pro I purchased August of 2010. It was plugged into one of the USB ports on the Macbook itself, no keyboard or hub of any kind in the middle.@ridogi Ah, OK, so VPN or firewall configuration. Unfortunately, neither is feasible, but it's good to know.Does trashing the plist for screen sharing fix it?A good question to ask is WHY is it doing that? Directly from Apple it won't do that. Has it been repaired or was it purchased used? A machine that was supposed to be new that does that would set off warnings to me."Shouldn't your music be in iTunes anyway?" Only music that was purchased from there would be. I have a lot of my CD collection on my iPod, which is probably about 30GB worth, and that's not on iTunes.I've noticed the same thing here. Seems like the wall charger is the only that support the device in heavy use.This is the setup I use. I have a Dell 2407 display, with both a MB Pro (DVI) and a Dell mini tower (VGA) attached. The PC keyboard and mouse are wireless so I just push them off to the side when they aren't in use; the laptop uses a keyboard & trackball that sit on a keyboard drawer, so I can just push the drawer in when the Mac isn't in use. Cheap and simple.Thanks to this I managed to sync apps with two computers - but what about this music headache? Why does Apple insist that I can only sync my music with one library? I just bought some music on my office PC and now can't sync it to my device cos it will erase everything already there. Pain.@senseful Most of the problems were in the resulting operating system, as you correctly described. It's important to note that most of these were more prone to occur with machines that were not "fresh installed". I.e. full of crappy stuff and then upgraded. In any case, Windows Vista has been a terrible OS in terms of "everything", so I strongly suggest you try a "clean" install of W7 when possible. W7 is very light and works fine, but thinking about having a Vista "before" that gives me the creeps. :)You want to add a DRM protected music file from one iTunes to another iTunes in another PC?However you can reinstall the OS without deleting the /Users directoryI would assume by switching the logic board I'd also be switching the corresponding processor/videocard/VRAM. So basically a total swap --- all the internals of one with all the internals of the other (keeping obvious similar pieces like the superdrive).@JBRW: Agreed. Now that I've started using Evernote too, I'd say it's great, but not really a Things replacement for me.For further reference, don't hesitate reading http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/4125/115@Mark that's an override? Or it's delete all files and reinstall?@Tom The default install for OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) preserves /Users@jtjacques that's an override of the system files? Or it's delete all system files and recopy?Yes (I am assume all tunes bought on the iStore are DRM protected).Thanks Harv - it could be what I'm looking for but I'm on Windows and that script is Mac only :o(It is an overwrite - but I would not rely on the result as the unwritten over files might not match the OSEverything except iTunes Plus.It is fresh out of the shrink wrap from the apple store. My best guess is that a software update went bad...

And you can drive a 24" external at 1920x1200, or better yet 1200x1920, plenty for coding.@Alex The white Macbook doesn't support 8GB of RAM.+1 for OmniGraffle. It isn't as 'thorough' an application as Visio, but I would be inclined to say that the vast majority of current Visio users would be satisfied, if not happy, using OmniGraffle in its place.@Mark I think its smarter than that.  It selectively deletes system directories and applications and replaces them.  So there shouldn't be anything left behind that the os cares about.Second the OmniGraffle recommendation.  I've been using it for 6 years, and its the best diagramming program I've found on any platform.  It will also import (some) Viso files.  The ones I've have problems with had pictures embedded from other Windows software.@JoshHibschman, I conjecture that iTunes uses Bonjour to enable AirPlay & library sharing.  I do not recall installing Bonjour Print Services prior to the appearance of the mDNSResponse.exe complaint, so maybe the iTunes Bonjour installation is not quite the same as the Print Services Bonjour installation.@mankoff: Didn't know that you can edit the user dictionary like that! I tried your suggestion but it doesn't work for me (German keyboard, iOS 4.0.1). There is another problem with all dictionary based approaches: they work for words where the spelling without the umlaut is wrong. But in German there exist many words that are valid with and without the umlaut. And in Swiss German there doesn't even exist a spelling dictionary!You need to add the Japanese Ten Key keyboard to be able to edit the user dictionary, not German. And yes, I agree, this solution is an imperfect hack with drawbacks.How did you get it on your iPod without it being in iTunes?I don't think this is natively possible with Automator. You could probably do something with some scripting (and the scripting actions if you need it to work inside Automator), but you'd have to run the workflow to detect changes since the last run.Did you look at launchd? cf http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1515730/is-there-a-command-like-watch-or-inotifywait-on-the-macThat was it exactly. Thanks.Do you mean when you're on that local network, or from outside via the Internet?It resides on a departmental share drive on the network.  That drive is mapped through group policy. The personal folders are, of course, mapped to the desktop inside outlook 2007.  The BB synch manager allows those folders linked in outlook to also be synched to the BB.  Can the Iphone (or a 3rd party app) do the same? While on the BB if you move an email from your inbox into a folder in your personal folder it moves it on the desktop as well.Strange. Works for me on iOS 4.0.1 w/ English, French, German, Greek, and Japanese 10 key in Notepad. Perhaps the first few times you type it you must manually set the accents? Perhaps if you hope it auto corrects the first time, it instead learns the non-accented way? I gotten it to work with a few words, but one time it didn't and I think that one time I didn't provide any hints for it at first...Not sure but I do notice that `mdls` return `kMDItemComment` and xattr is showing `kMDItemFinderComment` which are different attributes.I think your answer should be a comment, as it doesn't offer a solution to the question. If it was shorter I could just turn it into a comment as-is, but comments have a maximum length of 600 characters.i realized this a year ago and it was weird.@mankoff Yes, and that's the problem.  kMDItemFinderComment comes from com.apple.metadata.. kMDItemComment seems to be from elsewhere, and I'm not sure where.  I suspect iPhoto-specific metadata, but I don't know how to access it properly in order to write it.Have you tried using the "-x" flag to xattr?Cool. I think we've narrowed it down to DNS - for some reason your machine is not able to resolve the IPs to the websites. I do not have a reason as to why it does that but I would like to suggest that you change the DNS server entries on your network settings to 8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4 (these are Google DNS servers you can also use any free DNS services on the net eg. opendns) and test it out for a bit.Great idea. Let me try that. Thanks.I have that MacBook with 4Gb of RAM and have absolutely no issues with Xcode. I could probably get by on 2Gb, but I like having a bunch of programs open that I can rapidly switch between.I've chosen OmniGraffle as my answer, though maybe I'll use it to design the app I really want. :)That's it! Thanks!@mankoff - Er.. I just did.  Clearly you're getting at something and I'm missing it.  What should that do for me?..This sounds like the right kind of thing. Will give this a go later.Thanks, we're all PCs (Windows XP) though.Thanks - I don't want to break the iTunes sync relationship with this particular laptop though.Just as a bit of advice, I replaced the glass on my 3GS a while back and while it was difficult, it was certainly doable. The only real problem I had is that the replacement glass didn't have Apple's oleophobic (oil resistant) coating. It didn't seem like it would be much of a problem, but it turned out to be *very* difficult to clean and just about impossible to keep clean. With the old glass I could just wipe it across my shirt a time or two, but with the replacement I had to wipe and wipe and wipe, even needing water to get stuff off."the two parts are not separable without damage" - that implies I would have to change the LCD in addition to the glass? However, I found only the glass for sale on Taobao. My guess is there should be some way to change just the glass, isn't it?Yes, these are meant to be deployed on development devices and you cannot rollback. Beta 2 is out since yesterday. Time to update to already lower the issues but you'll have to wait the final release to get a stable version if you installed it on a production device.Do you think I can stay with 2gb?If you have an iPhone 4, then it is most likely still under warranty. Martin answered the question (and gets props for doing so), but I would argue to just take it in to be serviced by Apple. You risk a lot more than just voiding the warranty by doing this yourself.@forchita you could. a colleague developed an iPhone app and an iPad app with a 2GB white MacBook. But when you'll switch to 4GB, you'll wonder how you lived without it.@mankoff: It must be that it learned the uncorrected word; I found an
entry for fooxx in the German user dictionary
[de_DE-dynamic-text.dat](http://www.iphonehacks.com/2009/01/tips-to-add-words-to-iphones-dictionary.html).
But I had to go back and disable
auto-correction completely. It just doesn't work when I type English or
French words with the keyboard set to German. And changing the keyboard
everytime you write a foreign word is just plain silly...you don't break anything, this just offers a way to upload files without it.You need to be more precise.  First, do you want to develop an app? If so, you need to go to StackOverflow to ask that. Second, I think it should be retagged iOS (and maybe rephrase the question to not only target iPad-related issues)Oh no I'm not being obscure. Sounds like a difficult problem.OK, thanks. Was kind of hoping that there would be a built-in setting somewhere, but at least there's a solution available.@j-g: Tinkertool shows the system settings in a GUI interface as opposed to CLI, which can be harder to use for a lot of people.@Philip: Unfortunately Tinkertool only deals with .DS_Store files according to their [detail page](http://www.bresink.com/osx/0TinkerTool/details.html), which presumably means that this is the only hidden file that can be disabled through the CLI - the other files need custom tools. But BlueHarvest looks nice, and does what I need. (Found some [more details on the issue here](http://lowendmac.com/crews/06/0104.html) and [here](http://www.macworld.com/article/51284/2006/06/blueharvest.html))My home computer is already authorised. The music was downloaded at work. I can't sync to my iPhone at work cos it will erase all the music on the phone, and I can't re-download it from iStore onto my home PC. How the heck do I do this?"it's letting you use it until it decides to die altogether". Gasp! Don't you understand computers? No!, it's waiting until a totally critical moment when you absolutely have to have it work, like just before backing up all your data before taking it in for a repair.I'm sure the vender selling the glass would know better than Apple, so, sure, buy it from them. What do you have to lose?That's what I do too. Although it would be even better if I didn't need to, so I'm investigating the alternatives.@mankoff Gotcha.  Yeah, the -x flag, interestingly shows there's a kMDItemFinderComment, which seems to just be some hex.. definitely a weird problem.After the release of the first MacBook Air OS X could boot from a USB drive and FireWire drive.  I believe if a USB drive is formatted with a GUID partition and has an 10.5 install on it, it is bootable from it.Thats the first thing I thought of as well. +1have you tried a different cable?I have the same problem but my permissions have everything set to allow except for "special permissions"Mystery solved thanks to iotop. It was a network client (a virtual windows test box) that had mounted my home directory and appears to have been doing some kind of indexing or scanning or something. I went and disconnected the share from the wintendo side and it stopped grinding my raid array immediately.@Matthew - thanks, and best of luck!In my experience I had to do the same thing.Looks like someone down voted you, even though you're most likely correct.If you want info on app development, post to Stack Overflow.Well, I had all the backups up to date.  But ironically enough, it died entirely after this post.  I know it's dead, too, because I waited until I had another (brand new) MacBook Pro at my desk, and tried to turn it on.  If it could have, I **know** it would have started up then.Apple store won't even look at it if they know it's jailbroken.I found another useful tip today.  There is a flag in /etc/auto_master called "hidefromfinder".  If you turn this off for /net and /home, it improves the interoperability between finder and the automounter.I have sent my Jailbroken iPhones (2G, 3G, 3GS, 4) to Apple facility many a number of times. The trick is to factory reset every time you send it in. Try it but only if still under warranty. I am a registered Apple developer. This one time I got a free replacement on an out of warranty iPhone. Apple can be pricey but are great when it comes to service.Probably is correct. Isn't an answer to the question as asked, so it should probably be a comment where it might get voted up...Well, I guess I could add it back as one *AGAIN*. It was originally a comment. At least then they can't down-vote it.This doesn't match my observed behavior: I can exit a podcast near, but not at, the end, and it still counts a play.Thanks all. This one matches my observed behavior the closest, so I marked it accepted - I believe I've stopped a podcast with something like 20-30 seconds to go, and it's counted as a play. That's more consistent with a percentage than straight time ("the last few seconds").You can get Apple Remote Desktop on the Mac App Store [for $80](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-remote-desktop/id409907375?mt=12)No way! I had no idea. I have a version on my lappy so it doesn't show the price, just 'installed'. Question still stands, it would nice if there were free alternatives to roll out to our staff; but that's really good to know.However, if it did not do this, it would not be counting a podcast episode at all if you listen to it in pieces (and only the last few minutes on the last session).yes and it didn't help. as noted by other people too: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=958949smae thing is happening to my iphone 3gs. with 4.2.1. I even tried restoring. Didnt help.Taking in to your local Apple Store might be your next best option.@Jin Have you tried restoring the OS, but not restoring your data?You can try a program called TeamViewer.

Can you post the contents to [Pastie](http://pastie.org/)? For what its worth, using `defaults` to read my file returns [this](http://pastie.org/1483439) and I don't ever get a screensaver. Note however that I'm running 10.6.6, so if your file uses the old (XML) style of .plist, don't sweat it. You could just try trashing the file too.Thank you.  I will move this questoin to StackOverflow, retag as iOS and add more details.Thanks, I'll try that.The answers of "you get the same warranty from other retailers" are correct *unless* you buy your Mac on the gray market. I don't know how prevalent it is today, but for a while you could buy refurbished Macs from non-authorized retailers and you actually had no warranty. (Note that Apple sells their own refurbished machines sometimes, and they have full warranties; the warranty's existence is dependent upon the authorization status of the retailer.)You can check this other question where ARD is named but also other alternatives: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/6133/1227@Matthew: Is there any way to check the authorization status of a dealer? I noticed that on Amazon, many of the macs say that they you are purchasing it from some other retailer, not directly from Amazon. The product details is limited and doesn't mention much about the product itself, much less about a warranty.I rephrased it a bit. I hope that's okay for you, @SemyonThis list seems to be authoritative: http://solutionprofessionals.apple.com/catalog/ It's probably worth checking the various categories on the left if you're looking for someone, in case they don't happen to fall into the category I linked to.Yes, it doesn't answer my question directly, but I did look and automatic updates were switched on. So it was very useful to know!@Matthew: Thanks for the link, it really helped. Could you please post that as an answer so that I can accept it? I think it's the most correct answer since you can't blindly assume that any mac you buy online will have Apple's warranty. It seems that you must make sure that you are buying from an Apple authorized reseller.I added it, glad to help.At least you did not *notice* any issues, right? Sorry, couldn't resist. :-)By the way, the device is found somewhere at /Volumes/<name>+1 My answer too. Just because it works that way on Windows (and some linux), doesn't mean its a standard! Also, you are correct, earlier Mac OS did have this. Therefore its standard to me that enter renames something vs enter opens a file/folder.Wow, never knew it would be this simple! I am at work and will check as soon as I get home. If it works, you are a lifesaver ;) Thanks much!Actually, I rename files significantly less than I open them, and I rename directories significantly less than navigating into a directory.  Isn't part of file management to navigate inside directories?  Since Apple designs revolve thrive on user intuition, most people "intuitively" expect the return key to open a file.  This is why I found the action surprising.  I think the real answer is in the fact that "that's the way it has always been."  And it is not worth changing.I think I will end up leaving the ASP run on my Windows box... not worth the work if its not rigorous (I also have MSSQL integrated... it would be a mess to transfer).  With PHP, I'm going to give XAMPP for mac a shot first (because it worked well for me in Win).  I'll check out MAMP if things don't go so well.@IntuitionHQ It sounds like when a CD skips. My phone is not jailbroken.@JoshHibschman I think the only people who "intuitively" expect the return key to open a file are Windows users. Ask most people and they would say "i double-click to open a file." I realize that people have different usage patterns, but I rarely open files in the Finder. If it's stuff I use often, it's on the Dock. Otherwise, I use a launcher utility like Launchbar or Alfred.Is it not waking up regardless of which button you press? I ask only because the home button on my iP4 went mushy and became almost useless.@philip I'm pretty sure the buttons work perfectly.@kyle I tried that. looks like i may have to take it to the Apple store..This is sold at the Apple retail stores. It's cheap, works great and comes with a microfibre cloth. It's designed for safe use on electronic devices.How much memory do you have?+1 ghoppe's response.  Try switching to Windows after using Mac OS, and expecting a rename operation when you hit enter.  Only to find that it opens stuff.  Crazy-making.Ausmith1, something to note in the future. I was 100% unaware that you had made changes to this question, and your additions are GREAT! Thank you! Next time you make significant edits (not just typos/punctuation, but whole new chunks of content), add a comment too with the change you made, that way I get actively notified (read: e-mail) and can come back to this question.Thanks for the idea, I guess I can do that. But I am hoping for a way to open the original file directly without the video going through another conversion, where it might suffer (even a slight) loss of quality.I've never used Sophos for Mac, but I've seen Sophos do nasty and stupid things to Windows Servers, where arguably much more engineering energy is spent.  I wouldn't...You're not supposed to need to look at it.  It works well.I still use Smultron despite the developer (the intrepid Peter Borg) ceasing development.  Notepad++ is still by far my favorite editor on _any_ platform.The only app that's finished is one where development has ceased.  (Directly contradicts your req #4)@Harv I would be happy if it was a single keystroke on OS X.  Windows = F2 to rename a file, enter to open a file.  OS X you have to press two keys to open a file or dir... I would rather it was one. Of course, it is not a big deal, but an annoyance.I think http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr can also support Japanese.Auto parts stores usually have large, inexpensive microfiber cloths. They're sold for polishing your car to a mirror-like sheen, but they're the very same microfiber material sold for cleaning eyeglasses, etc.As I know Apple won't support windows XP and vista in 10.6.6 bootcamp but you can install them if you want. it's just like Microsoft that didn't support windows 98 any more but you can still install this version if you want.Because a programmer coded it that way?Good to know, I wasn't aware of this.Windows 7 is compatible as well.@mummey updated.This really just boils down to "You're used to Windows." doesn't it?The only issue I could possibly foresee is if Apple removes WinXP or Vista support from it's Boot Camp drivers. Otherwise, should be free and clear.It's entirely unfair to compare expectations coming from another OS. If everything only took one key to activate, the usability experience would be miserable, one slipped key and you could undertake a completely different action than you meant to.I suspect this "issue" is one of the reasons people "hate" the Finder. Perhaps I need to use Path Finder before I really state this, but I ultimately have no real problems with the Finder.Most video input solutions these days are USB. We are not limited to the display port.For video capture, yes. But not for realtime video display to HDMI standards. USB 2 doesn't have the bandwidth to drive an iMac display.@ghoppe I'd add the *built-in* launcher **Spotlight** to the list. If you're looking for something specific, why browse when you can search.Here is the [AirFoil Speakers link](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/speakers.php) and that is almost what I'm looking for. You have to be running AirFoil on the Mac (or another PC) to send audio to the AirFoil Speakers program. I'd like to not have to buy AirFoil for Mac. This is definitely the closest I've seen to a solution for my problem.@g - however when the OP said and asked for a UK insurer it was closed as for a small geographic are - but leaving it for US answers seems OK - either both or neither should be closedLittle Snitch is awesome.@Samuel Walker - that seems a bit insane.  don't you think??Perhaps, but that is how I understand the iTunes / iPod Photo handling procedure. Thinking the answer is insane is not a reason for down voting when that answer is correct.You're right about why, but it shouldn't be doing it every time. OP, are you clearing caches, or moving/deleting iTunes' folders?@Reid any issues with the solution?Great tip with the SSD. That can *greatly* improve build times.This doesn't work with iPhone/iPod Touch.Make sure you're setting Computer Sleep and not Display sleep. Photo here: http://imgur.com/yVGb4.pngI checked to be sure: http://cl.ly/3G110K2b443Q3R3h0t37Out of curiosity, can you try setting Display Sleep to something after the Computer Sleep? Maybe we'll find a bug. The other thing that comes to mind: Maybe your screensaver is activating and keeping something from sleeping (this would also be a bug). Try changing settings until it goes smoothly, Screen Saver, Display Sleep, Computer Sleep, with at least a minute between each.The preference pane prevents you from setting Display Sleep to after Computer Sleep. I did try them as both the same thing and different (thinking the former might have a bug.) I also just tried Screen Saver, Display Sleep, and Computer Sleep with a minute between them, but no dice.I really wish people didn't downvote useful answers.its not your phone. its a problem with google maps, as many other people have been experiencing the same problem. it must be from a recent update.Thanks - that article's a good read. To expand on that a bit, that link says there is a trick you can use by cancelling syncing a movie to a device - but as Samuel says since it's HD I don't have a device I can sync this to.BTT is awesome...You're welcome! Glad to help.If you're using FruitMenu or Application Program Enhancer try disabling them - there's a bunch of people who are having this problem here: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2710337 - if that's not it, can you give a bit more detail re: the menu items not doing anything?Thanks!  I will check it out.@Mira A.  I just checked - there's only one command line tool.  It only seems to support one extended attribute, and that's the one OpenMeta uses for ratings and such.  Thanks for pointing it out, but it doesn't look like it'll do what I want...My guess would have been an app, but none of those processes should be preventing it from sleeping.I would think that it would only optimize new photos.  IE photos that have not yet been optimized and uploaded onto the device.  Sounds like a db problem on the iPod.  Try formatting and restoring.Hmm.  I can already get the ASCII/Binary equivalent by doing xattr -l <foo>.jpg.  The string comes back to "bplist00P".. which I'm not sure what to do with.I don't have either of those installed, and by not doing anything, I mean I use the Store menu, select "Sign In..." and it blinks in response to being clicked and nothing else apparently happens.  There are no sign in dialogs anywhere.Thanks for the tip!Cool. Thanks a lot!::puts away brillo & bleach:: thanks! This is awesomeEvernote is the real thing.That's not the string. That's the "magic" at the start of the binary property list file format. In the example above, the string is actually the empty string.How I do this is plug my laptop into the stereo, and use the Apple Remote app to control the tunes over Wi-Fi. Works great!Thats kinda the opposite of what I want to do. I'm trying to avoid physcially plugging my laptop into the stereo. I want to be able to move the laptop around and still have it play music through the stereo.simplifymedia looks great, but they withdrew their iPod App from the store on March 12th! Looks like they're working towards launching something new ...aaaaaand now they've been bought by Google. If someone has this solution, I'd be curious to hear it.Thats exactly what I'm after. I just tried it out, it worked pretty well with a music player (Foobar2000) although it did stutter occasionally. It struggled with more processor intensive music-composition software such as Reason, and stuttered a lot. Presumably if I had a more powerful laptop, it would cut out the stuttering. Nice and easy to install and setup though. $25 for the non-demo version.Looks like you've installed vmware.

The computers and all devices can see it.  Hoping it lasts - but this is a lot further than I got before.  Thanks!The only thing I've seen that affects mine now is when I'm moving a lot of other data via wireless, or the wife is streaming something to her computer so the music isn't filling the buffer in the Express and it eventually runs dry. It will halt playing at that point but should eventually resync.Yes.  All in client mode.  Not happy that I can't extend something not Apple, but got over that frustration a while ago.In System Prefs > Lang & Text > Input Sources, do you have "Use same in all documents" or "Allow different for each document" selected?Yeah I remember we had similar problems with the older circle power adapters. I think it's a bit better now with the magsafe power packs, but it's still one of those 'scary-who-knows-what-could-go-wrong-here' things.@mankoff: "Use the same one in all documents", but it does the same thing for both options. The problem is that I can't change it when the password field has focus, but once I click somewhere else, I can change it back.What makes a difference isn't the age or model of the power-supply, it's whether the supply puts out sufficient power.windows@Nathan G. - i am not clearing caches, etc . .Not worried about testing - I want to be able to deploy my apps.  I was just wondering why there is a 30-step process for this basic, fundamental part of iPhone development.  +! for the great information.  i did not know about that.There are many Windows-only items.

Seems the two apps to check out are Awesome Note and NoteMaster? What would happen if you're ready to sync back but a doc has been edited elsewhere? This would all happen in the background? (I wouldn't have to remember to start up the app each time I'm back home)@Shahryar - I don't know how any of the apps handle merge conflicts; it's very likely the last revision synced becomes the actual version. As for working locally without a net connection and syncing when one is available, I believe they all allow it, though word on the street is that Google will soon launch an HTML5 replacement for their now-defunct Google Gears technology. The new system sounds even better, providing not just local storage of documents on disconnected devices, but also for full Docs functionality locally, syncing when possible.@Shahryar - I turned your answer into a comment, as it was asking new questions instead of answer @Rob's question. Please consider creating a new question, as you'll be much more likely to get a response.+1 ClamXav. Not only is it low in resource consumption, but it doesn't hook into the bowels of your system like Norton and VirusBarrier will do. I've used all three, and both Norton and VirusBarrier not only slowed down my Mac but also cause kernel panics (equivalents to Windows' blue screen of death).

(I would have +1'd your response and added this as a comment, @mankoff, but I have a brand new account with no points, so I'm not allowed to +1 or make comments. :/)@Nathan G. - WTF? I **really** don't get why dropbox is anything worthy of comment. It's a web-file-sharing site. Big Whoop. My SVN server will kick it's ass.If the CPU is a two core, a 700% CPU usage is a bug :)+1 since this is just what is happening.That is a great question. I bought a new 60W power adapter for using with my MBP 13" and a Henge Dock, and now I learn that I could have bought a 85W that would be more versatile if I upgrade my Mac in the future.Dropbox is not a web file sharing site. I replicates automatically an area of your file system to other machines. svn requies intervention. I put my repositories on dropbox for backup etc. (OK there is a web interface but not used)Because of the way the iPhone 4 is designed, I haven't seen anyone selling just the glass.

Take your time to wander in the preference panes and come back to us with your questions.Not that it is terribly important, but some of the recent 15" MacBook Pro models actually shipped with the 60W adapter.

Right-click (two finger tap) > Eject  -- just for completion :DYou should be able to move the .dmg to the Trash before ejecting if you want, but you'll have to eject the mounted disk before you empty the trash.@Josh: I always forget about the right-click options. :)While in Chrome, try a cmd+shift+delete, clear all passwords (for all amounts of time), cookie data, history, etc.  Does this change anything?  Does the same behavior happen in Safari?@CajunLuke, okay, that's why it was yelling at me. I didn't have the mounted disk ejected first. Speaking of disk, where do I go to see the HDD space?@Alex: like LudoMC said, if you play around with the system preferences, you'll be understanding things in no time.  Pretty soon you'll be hooked like the rest of us :)-1 Lengthy answer, but I don't see how it answers the OP's questions.Did you read it? I explain why things have to be done they way they do. Thank you for -1'ing me for thoroughness.I did read it. It reads more like instructions on how to follow the convoluted process of creating the profiles rather than explaining why, but there's really no way for any of us to know that, is there? Sorry, but the -1 stays.If you're working with binary `plist` files, then `plutil -convert xml1 file.plist` might be helpful.Do a "Get Info" on your hard drive. (Command-I or File > Get Info) That'll show you total, used, and free.No, my iPhone is not jailbroken and I don't want to.No auto update in the App StoreI can recommend the 'How To' videos of the common Mac features at http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/ plus time spent in a larger Apple Store that has seminars is worth it.I tried enabling it and I still get an error from all of the WebGL demo sites. I think there are still kinks to work out.Definitely sounds like a great tast for Automator. It has the same end result, and is probably the easiest solution without hacking about. Weird that they don't support other formats though.Aha! Found it. So, 'Get Info' is essentially the same as 'Properties' in Windows?I've done this as well, but I like to record GPS logs of my entire tramps since I do most of my tramping off track and like to be able to look at the entire logs of my travel on my return. I love seeing all that data about distance, elevation changes and such as well.Fair enough. Then my 'solution' won't work, of course. However, in my experience, using GPS on the iPhone demands lots of battery life. I doubt one can use the iPhone + GPS constantly longer than a few hours. Even when turning off all other network requests. But I am only talking about my 3GS. Maybe an iPhone 4 does better, I don't know.It has lasted pretty well for me - even when doing full days geocaching it still keeps up, and that's while finding information over 3G as well.

When tramping I usually carry both a backup battery and a solar battery charger, but honestly, when my phone is constantly searching for signal, it just chews through the battery. It drains flat in half a day or so.Interesting, I hadn't realised quite how it worked. Thanks for sharing.Awesome, that's just what I wanted.Great solution. I'm going to have to try this when I get home. Thanks!Essentially, yes. There's not much you can edit in Get Info, though. Certainly not to the extent you can in Windows.Doesn't this just disable data, but not the phone itself? It seems I can make phone calls with everything disabled in this way - which means the phone would still be searching for signal and using battery.

Oh, and currently on a tethered jailbreak - might see about changing that though.Yes, as I said, Edge remains, unless you turn it off with SBSettings.@Alex Can you make these each separate questions?Alex, please consider opening new questions instead of just adding on to this one (and welcome!)Kyle - thank you, thank you, thank you.
Tried it and it works.  Seems there is "always" a way to outsmart the machine.
Go it to work for one, now I will make a little library and I see no reason why it won't work.
Greatly appreciated.
EdThanks Alex! You're likely to get more fruitful responses this way.One of the main frustrations for me is that you can not use copy-past feature for new Skype client as it runs under another user account (((Yeah, got ahead of myself with the other question... Trying to add another question for the other pieces, but the darn reputation throttling is blocking me.Looks good, I installed it and I'll poke around it later. It has a lot of features which I'll have to learn one by one (So I don't do more damage on my own, lol). Thanks!Even with edge off in SBSettings I can make phone calls. I might be confused but I thought Edge is just for transmitting data, not for making phone calls - even with all of these things disabled, I can still make phone calls. What I'm hoping for is a solution that means everything is disabled except GPS, and that the phone won't be searching for a network.Clarification to my "be careful" remark: maintenance software for OS X tends to allow you to do things that can damage the system.  For a newbie the system takes great care of itself and shouldn't need extra software.  All you're doing, then, is opening yourself up to the risk of doing something you might wish you hadn't.Was it not formatted as HFS+J?thanks for the tip. I'll be taking it slow as I get used to working with OS X, but as I've done with all of other PCs, I'll eventually start poking around with things I shouldn't be (and win, muwahahaha!).It was and still is. Nothing changed, just wiped it and everything worked fast.You are right. SBSettings is still the answer. I updated my answer above. Under SBSettings > More > Set Toggle, you can add a **Phone** toggle and turn it on/off.Hi @CajunLuke! Well, I don't know if the Finder is taking over, but I followed the steps you outline, but sadly the disc just spins down and nothing happens like before. I restarted the MacBook and tried again, but it was the same result...I'm assuming this is equivalent to Windows' "Check Disk"?Run the Disk Utility after any software installation, including Apple's software updates. It will reset file permissions in case they somehow changed from Apple's expected settings. Also, be aware that Apple pre-installs Ruby, Perl and Python. Don't replace those as Apple actually uses them.You'll find that Mac OS, like other *nix-based systems, can run and run with a minimum of fuss. Apple's "It just works" comment really is based on customer feedback, it's not just advertising blather.Does Boot Camp say it wants a CD or a DVD? Do you have a writable CD you can try with? I'll have another look when I get home to my Mac.This happens in almost any list where items can be deleted.don't worry, I got it figured out. Look at my answer for details. I am however proud to say it wasn't me screwing things up! :) Oh, and thanks for the help today!On my iPhone it seems the phone toggle disables everything, including GPS - I read a comment from BigBoss at Macrumors saying that the phone toggle is in fact the same as airplane mode, and everything (but wifi) is disabled. Can you tell me if you can you can use GPS with that phone toggle switched to off?Maybe try the firefox beta as an alternative.Thanks for your answer glenstorey.  And thanks for quoting and linking to the relevant Apple info.  Although there seems to be some support for using a lower watt adapter on a higher watt laptop, I think I will play it safe and only borrow my 15" PowerBook adapter (85w) for my 13in PowerBook (60w) when necessary.More info? What's the machine? How old? What kind of software is installed? Additional info would be helpful.~Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScreenSharing.plist@garikapati I highly doubt you can do it without jailbreaking.

From the pmset man page: "hibernatefile - change hibernation image file location. Image may only be located on the root volume. Please use caution. (value = path)".  Note that your secondary drive is, by definition, not the root volume.

Thanks anyway.This is exactly what I was going to say, this does exactly what you want it to do. There is an option in the app to capture all system audio, although it can have an ever so slight amount of lag. Might be an issue for gaming.So I solved this by syncing at work which did erase all tunes from my iPhone and added only the album I had purchased.

Then you can load content to it from multiple PCs without doing a complete sync. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1535@Cawas I was looking if somebody in the millions of iPhone owners did that.... so I can get help.@SeniorShizzle - tried that out, but it seems to be a total brick 8-(. First, I connected the iPod to the USB for charging overnight. Then, I activated iTunes (not a Admin account, but a regular user account), then held the home button while plugging the cable, twice, but nothing happened.

Would downvote, but I don't have the rep yet. (If this works on some Macs and not others, you might consider going into more detail; this would be an extremely handy piece of info for users of the Macs it *does* work on.)I will update my question to say "unlock" rather than "jailbreak". I always keep the version up to date, so I have the latest. There may be updates before my move also.Is this your main, boot drive or an external drive? External drives are mounted in `/Volumes/{Drivename}/`I have two drives in the machine, an SSD with the OS on it and a HDD with all my data. I have a symlink on the SSD for my home directory so /Volumes/SSD/Users/Ross/ points to /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/Ross.  The Macintosh HD drive is the original boot disk.  I'm trying to get ride of the space in the volume name, but when I do I get all kinds of errors.  I thought it was a simple as updating the symlink but it doesn't seem to be.  Maybe logging in as another user?Supposing you are currently on 4.2.1 with an iPhone 4, there isn't currently any methods released to unlock it, but the good news is two different unlockers have said there will be unlocks available, just not until iOS 4.3 is released.

I hope this helps. Good luck.I went to Apple and they wouldn't let me **pay** for a fix/replacement because I had replaced the screen already. I ended up upgrading.I upgraded to the iPhone 4.Things is really a (very, very pretty) to-do list rather than a freeform note-capturing app.A lot of the scripts that Onyx fires up are run by Mac OS X itself if you reboot occasionally.+1.. and also good to reboot once in a while.@Alex, yes it is similar to 'CHKDSK /F' but also does the equivalent of a Windows 'Repair' operation on system folders.It's no surprised that this would improve speed - you started again from scratch. Was the drive previously pretty full? How big is your TM drive compared to the total size of all the disks its backing up? I'd surmise that it was probably spending a ton of time 'thinning', which is throwing out in-between versions of files to make more room for newer versions.

Have a look at 'Console' and put 'backupd' in the Search box. Scroll back to before you formatted.. any clues?If you can replicate it show the replication to the GeniusI've found Things to be simple enough that its worked for notes; that's just the way I chose to use it at the time. These days its been Evernote but I'm hoping I get back to the point where I'm using Things again.Good suggestion. Drive was not full. Internal is 300GB used of 500GB. Backup drive was 500GB and had 71GB free. I've posted sample system.log output into the original question rather than here so it can be formatted properly. Doesn't seem to be thinning, but there may have been a spotlight issue, although spotlight was disabled on that drive.@Agos: Yeah, admittedly it has a somewhat annoying motif geared towards keeping you out of debt, but I've found the budgeting tools to be really nice, and it generates good reports/graphs. You just have to ignore the "here're some tips for saving and reducing debt" stuff if you're not deeply in debt.If the APs are on the same network, you should be connecting automatically to any in range, right?@Nathan Connecting to the network isn't the problem, it's just one is a G network and one is an N network, and I want to use the N one whenever possible. Changing the SSID is, unfortunately, not an option.Gotcha. I was missing the g/n bit.Cool thanks, this looks awesome.Ah.  It lasted for a day.  No machines can see it.  Airport Utility can't see it.  Steady green light and router can see it and BlueRay gets an ip from it's ethernet for Netflix access.This worked. I think the key to success here was using the IP address of the machine. I'd only tried this approach using the hostname, which doesn't seem to be resolving. I guess the Finder approach is using the hostname. Nice catch. Enjoy the points!@JohnBusteed: are you sure it's "anything" being connected that causes it?1) what devices are connected? 2) where does it stall when booting with them connected? 3) If you try a verbose boot (command-v when starting) what are the last few lines that show up?Bummer.  I don't have a great answer to your original question then other than something like SnapzPro.It's most likely a firmware incompatibility.  Apple switched the EFI firmware from 32-bit to 64-bit in that timeframe, and newer cards only support the 64-bit EFI firmware.  Since Windows and Linux don't use the EFI interface (usually) they don't have a problem, but the Mac OS depends on it to properly recognize the card.The tutorial you've linked to doesn't mention this issue - are you expecting it to fix something specifically or is it just a guess?I'm using iPhoto '08 (7.1.5), but I'm willing to upgrade. Please limit your answer to iPhoto, though; the average user won't cough up the dough for Lightroom or Aperture.The iPod is in disk mode. When I try partitioning it, I get the message: "Partition failed with error: POSIX reports: The operation couldn't be completed. Cannot allocate memory."I'm having trouble with `Rez -append` when working with `.avi` files. `### Rez - Fatal error trying to open the resource file "Video.avi" for writing.`
` any ideas?What version of Mac OS X?@Ian glad to see if it worked. I find it odd that Finder (using Bonjour) is not finding the other host properly. If you want to do some more investigation, try changing the host name, that would flush it and will broadcast it again through mDNS (bonjour discovery service). Maybe finder will catch it this time. ;)Also, what specifically do you mean by metadata? Just standard image metadata, like EXIF stuff, or also iPhoto-specific type things like faces, locations, etc.OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.6What sort of metadata are you hoping for that it won't provide?Right, I'm already using Handbrake to rip. But that has nothing to do with automatically fetching metadata. I'll edit the question to clarify.Name of show, episode, description, season #, etc.Double clicking the center button will skip to the next song in the iPod app normally, I don't know if jailbreaking would affect that.+1 for "orthographic"I'll try the hostname change. Thanks again!Thanks, fs_usage did the trick!@Phil Calvin: I have the same problem as you do. I tried narrow it down with `sudo fs_usage -f filesys` (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6984/what-process-is-accessing-the-hard-drive), but couldn't make any sense of it. It seems *random* to me. Maybe you have better luck?Thanks for the solution. I have a non-jail broken iPhone and was able to get what I needed. However, I'd also be interested in sans-Terminal solutions for non-technical folks if you've used any.I guess at this juncture the only option is to take the iPod touch to an Apple Store. I don't know if there's one near you, otherwise you can call Apple and they will tell you a price for repairs through the mail. Sorry and good luck!Since it doesn't seem to exist on the wifi model, I wonder if they are setting it automatically from the GPS. That would seem to be more accurate than using an internet time server.I am using 802.11gThanks for the response! I'd seen it but was hoping someone else had tried this before (I guess I can be the guinea pig this time). Cheers!Yeah, I've thought about doing something like this but ultimately wanted a backup solution that wouldn't require me connecting to an external hard drive or time capsule. I'd like something that works on the road, etc. Thanks for the response though!@jstarek: so does that mean time machine can backup to your idisk?I've found the process outlined in the blog post to be a bit fragile: every once in a while, Time Machine decides to stop backing up the File Vaulted home directory, and - despite rules to exclude it - starts backing up the encrypted volume instead (while I'm logged on no less, so I'm not quite certain the backups won't be corrupt).Have you tried [NinjaKit](https://bitbucket.org/os0x/ninjakit/overview) (@Dori's suggestion)? It looks to be based on S5, so newer framework.The only downside to this approach is you have to detect and active TimeMachine backup in progress before you do the sync. Otherwise you might be sync'ing a filesystem that's not in a steady state.TimeMachine has all kinds of trouble sync'ing to non-HFS+ formatted shares. I know I went through hell and back trying to get remote TimeMachine backups to an SMB share, shared out from my Windows server. I gave up after a time. I'd like to hear if anyone's successfully used a FUSE-mounted drive for a TM backup.@garikapati I wish you best of luck! ;) as for bruno suggestion, there is at least one cheaper option on cydia: ***Recent/CallLog Delete*** ($ 1.49) but **Mobile Log** is great indeed.@lpacheco - instead of trying to partition it, just run First Aid on it and see what's reported.I think I never wrote anything grammatically worse than my previous message and I wasn't even drunk. Plus, couple weeks later, I hardly ever use the app because it's so impractical!@d'ombre - yeah, the author's Japanese, so the English docs are minimal. There's a [little bit here](http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?u=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/os0x/searchdiary%3Fword%3D*%255BNinjaKit%255D) which might be some help. So far as individual scripts go, most work, but yes, some don't. For FB, Unfriend Finder works for me, so it may just be an Autopoke issue.It's almost that simple, you need to make sure that the "sync contacts" checkbox is ticked when you plug your iphone in.iPhone speaker? The icon appears when I have no airplay or bluetooth devices or headphones@Ian it's possible to avoid this sort of "clipping" if you program TM and Arq to do it at certain hours. But yes, this requires a local storage anyway.@Kevin as an alternative you can use Arq directly :) (I do) You lose the benefit of "time" machine, but you have a backup in the cloud :)Interestingly, it also made the file unable to accept a new icon via the Get Info copy/paste method.But it does have to upgrade the vm, which can take a little while. Once you've upgraded you can't open it on the previous version of parallels anymore.Their upgrade cycle is crazy! It feels like they come out with a new version every tuesday!@Ian me also, I'm going to give it a try today and see where I get but would love to hear if anyone else has had any success!Can i upgrade the firmware to the 64bit version and if so how?What are you trying to achieve by doing this? As Chris says,  a lot of routers have this kind of setting, so that may be your best bet.do you try to create new Location in Network Preferences?Oh, duh. Automator. The app that I always thought was a great idea yet, despite my inclination toward automation, I never wound up using. It never seemed to have the right modules, so I always wound up having to use AppleScript. But this is the perfect use.
One reservation, though: I'm concerned that iPhoto will complain about me changing the photos in its library behind its back. What do you think? Can I get by with just rebuilding the library after I do this?@user2113 So, did they change it?@Mark good point with showing them.It seems like I will have to do some Automator work for this. That's not very Apple like, three different solutions (Grab, Preview and ??4) that don't share the same backend...I have searched for this problem too, but you may have to give as much information as possible because the number of reasons for a macbook not working on wpa on linksys routers are endless. Do you put your macbook to sleep ? What version of Leopard is it ? How is the DHCP working ? Could someone be bumping you from the network (I don't know if this is how deauth attacks works) How far is the router from the macbook most times?The next time it comes up run `top -o cpu` from Terminal to get a better grasp on what is going on.@Merchako iPhoto will read whatever it finds in the FileSystem, but just in case, try it with a small subset (like create an album for testing purposes) ;)  tell us what happened. ;)Not to dig up this older question, but today I've discovered the interaction between Spotlight and Time Machine.. in part anyway.  It seems TM stores snapshot info as Spotlight metadata, allowing it to be searched, and acted, on.  See http://drainbamage.nl/2008/01/leopards-extended-file-attributes-time-machine-and-quarantine/You can use `lsof` to list open files. Also helpful might be `fuser`.Maybe if you dig into the preferences file and try to edit manually . I know for an old powerbook G4 (Mac 10.4.11) I have the airport command line tool "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport" with the --associate and --bssid options available but it seems to be removed from newer releases.I haven't been able to make this work.  Thanks for the suggestions though.I don't know of a solution but I know of how I got in a similar situation, I was in a foreign city, data roaming and compass/location services (Map and Gowalla) were always running. One night it ended up like how you described when I tried to wake from using the Camera app. I am not sure how many apps/services running you can have open at once because I have curbed my use and watched for unused open apps since then and I have not had any problems.Alternate answer to "how to access windows PC's on the network": very carefully.  :)This was on a call, with nothing plugged in or connected via BT/AirPlay.  The "iPhone" option is for the normal earpiece and the "iPhone Speaker" option is for speakerphone use.almost worked. I can now see from my Windows 7 PC the MacBook, but it won't let me open it, with an error of "Can't find the network path", which is dumb because I can ping the MacBook and get the address... The MacBook however, still can't see any of the Windows PCs (all Windows 7). Do I need to add a WINS server entry? Can it be the router?Out of curiosity, do you have FileVault enabled? Or Secure Empty Trash?Actually, I was accessing the MacBook from the PC using the wrong syntax (forgot `\\`). So, I can access from the PC to the MacBook fine now. I tried the 'Connect to Server' you showed and it should be working fine, if it hadn't been trying to go over 'afp://'... Is there a workaround for that? I already turned it off in Sharing.Do you mean 'afp://' is prepopulated in the Connect to Server box? I don't get that even with afp enabled...Perhaps better than `lsof` or `fuser` is `fs_usage`. Some combination of those three, limited to just the process that is hogging the CPU (found via top), ought to help, assuming I/O is involved.@Alex - Connecting from the Macbook to the PC.. when the dialog comes up for 'connect to server', make sure the path is smb://foo.bar/shareName, (where foo.bar is the hostname, or the IP, depending on your situation...).  Windows doesn't use AFP, whereas the Mac does by default.I guess I have still to learn from the intrinsics of the Mac, but it does make sense. Thanks for the answer.Er.  Everything is indexed unless you explicitly tell it not to be.  I think there are instances of external drives not being indexed by default, but I'd have to look it up.  I suppose you could put together some conditions and pass them to find.@Harv - Uh... LOTS of the system stuff is not indexed.@Fake Name - k, great.  Colour me corrected.  And submit a response, then.  :)Apple specifically doesn't want you syncing with multiple computers.  To do this, you will need to find an application that will pull the data from your iPad back to your computer.  It may involve jailbreaking your iPad.Please bear in mind that some countries *do not* have the option to select "None". (E.g.: Spain)@Harv Spotlight indexes only "Everything within the scope of your permissions", but won't go to ~/Library/Cache or Preferences by default unless you activate "Other" in the config. Also, /System and such are *not* indexed. As for the OP's question, I'm not sure that there's a "Metadata" editor to read the index for a drive. But others may be more clever and come up with an answer.Can you share that image? So we can test and tell you the result with the application we used.Thanks. I suppose I need to make some experiments with this to find out the most compact yet readable size of QR code to use.Yea.. Sadly, because of the different cameras that comes with the different iPhones, there won't be one limit which works for all..@Mart Also if you chose None you can just sign in and do some little job (like rating music) if you want buy free app iTunes tell you fill your credit card information. so choosing None is useless for downloading free app.Doesn't sharepoint use WebDAV? If so, then it should be possible to mount it by Finder's Connect to Server feature by entering HTTP URL.I think it's more likely that it's getting it from the mobile carrier. (My old Nokia cellphone doesn't have GPS but it also has an option to get the time from the carrier.)My question is more about productivity than economy :) Thank you.I actually do both this and iTunes sync.seems like you just want a mount that doesn't block the camera.@am1 in France, you can download free apps even if you don't enter your credit card information.http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/7027/1945 :)I had the Finder set to show invisible files, and turning that off seemed to cure things. I'd had that setting on for a while though, so I'm hesitant to assume that I've cured the problem for good. As I mentioned, there have been other cases where I thought I'd solved this only to see it happen again.@Harv That is not accurate. While hard drive failure on a computer is not common, iTunes _does_ offer an option to backup your purchases from an iOS device without syncing.@mummey Purchases, yes.I wonder what you mean by productivity. But since you have 500G internal, I'd suggest atleast 1T external for time machine.lsof seems very useful. Didn't find a specific suspicious file to try fuser on. Trying fs_usage right now on configd (see answer to NSGod below). @Nathan - nope, neither.Thanks - as you may have noted from my answer to NSGod, the Finder CPU usage has gone down, but now configd seems to be acting up, albeit mildly. I wouldn't normally worry about it, but I'd like here's the Console output from thelast hour or so, which definitely encompasses when configd started getting busy: http://pastebin.com/V8qpLuD2I was assuming Macintosh. If this is Windows, I can't help.You beat me to the punch. My advice for buying memory & hard drives is always to buy the most you can afford. I've been telling people this for, probably, 10 years.Nice response. The only thing I would add to it is to check the health of your hard drive. My old Mac Pro was getting really slow a few months ago and replacing the boot drive fixed it.Could you Authorize this new computer and check whether you can bring back those docs. But without using a 3rd party tool, you can't bring back the Music.This is not surprising. Hard drives are known to slow down when they reach the last 15%-20% of their capacity. Also I find Drobo drive enclosures to be slower than real external drives over the same interface (USB2, Firewire). One trick to keep a disk fast is to create a 25% partition and tell Time Machine to use the 75% partition. Use the other 25% sparingly.Worked well, thanks.1 - It's `WPA` or `WPA-Personal`, anyway i tried changing it from both Macbook and Router configuration and try both and it didn't work.  2 - Tried to remove the network from the preferences and it didn't work.3 - I cannot find this 'index' or 'key index' you are talking about. Where is it?  4 - Using WEP it doesn't connect.  4 - Another Macbook can connect to it.I would like to point out that that option is $150 with lots of of time, effort, and risk.  Going through Apple is $200 and is fast, easy, and warranty-able.Does this happen only when you sync, or does it happen when the iPhone hasn't been plugged into the computer at all?@Harv, got it all worked out, thanks for the help!Goodreader? What's that? A book, a magazine, a website or an application?I couldn't really give a definitive answer. I was listening to a podcast the day before yesterday, then I synced last night and then when I turned the phone on this morning it had lost the position. I fast forwarded it tonight and listened to some more and then synced again and it's fine.The funny part about this is that it was originally meant to be a mute switch. When Colbert showed his (pre-release) iPad off at the Grammys the screen was bouncing back and forth between landscape and portrait.I imagine Steve Jobs having a panic attack and calling up the design team to fix that one.Not sure if it's related (I guess not, since it does work on your computer) but in iTunes if you: 

Right click on the podcast --> get info --> options --> there is a checkbox to choose remember playback position.

Also, for me, I often accidentally click the back button when I'm trying to pause (guess this isn't your problem either) which also obviously causes the podcast to restart.Great instructions, +1DTerm does not require SIMBL like Visor does. It's great.http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/256/can-i-change-my-os-x-themeI've been using the OmniGraffle Pro Trial for a day now and it does an excellent import/export of Visio files.  Answered!Do you have installous? and just a point, if you manually install an app, you wont be able to update it through the appstore.Mine forgets that I was listening to a podcast at all sometimes, with no pattern that I've discerned (definitely not syncing, it sometimes forgets within an hour of having listened), but it doesn't forget my place in the podcast. That would bit.It's the iPod app from Apple, though, pre-installed on the device. I'd think they would manage it correctly: I certainly can easily ensure such a simple thing in the apps I develop regardless of memory conditions (worst case you save it when you receive the memory alert), so I suspect it's something else.Thanks @nathan, I'll check those outHave you tried booting in Safe Mode? http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1455This is what Disk Utility does. Shouldn't make any difference doing this or using the GUI utility on the install disc.I wonder if somehow an extension or something in firefox already is using the cmd-shift-L shortcut?Yes, but to the best of my knowledge, it can only be used to install IPA files. I'm looking to basically restore an application from a .tar file.My goal is to restore a backup of the app's directory from a .tar file (so that all my settings and data are restored), not install a new app.@Charlie the index can't be changed on some routers.  If yours is one of those, then let's not focus on that, because it's not the problem.  You said another Mac has connected to your network before.  Get that Mac, go into System Preferences, Network, Airport, Advanced.  Open up your wireless profile.  Make sure the settings are your Macbook are exactly the same.@Alex - No problem.  Glad we could help.  :)+1 AHT.  Hold D while booting your iMac to get into that.have u tried installing the app (as new) and then overwriting the .tar file.Or you can use iFile from cydia and locate the app and try to install it.Nope, no references to the app anywhere. I deleted the contents of all the intermediate build directories. The app is gone for sure.Well then, mark that as answered!You should accept your answer so everyone knows it's correct.iPod from Apple or not, it is still an app on the iPhone that I would think is beholden to the same memory and interruption rules as every other app on the iPhone. I think the only person who knows the answer to this question is the developer.Worth noting that the Terminal app in OS X supports lots of windows and tabs. Does that not do it for you?@Cristian: what specific features are you looking for? btw, awesome avatar :)@Nathan and @calavera what I want is to have different terminal consoles inside the same window. With the Terminal app I can open tabs and open different windows, but that does not offer the same flexibility of `Terminator`.@Christian You can save a group of windows, and even have that auto-open with Terminal. Use Window-> Save Windows as Group. Not all you want, but a step in the right direction, I think.Still not as flexible as I want, but it's worth knowing that. Thanks.Odd definition of hell. There is dependency bloat (which is annoying), but the whole point of fink is you type `fink install terminator` and walk away, come back in 10 or 120 minutes, and it is done.Totally not what you're looking for, but.. check out http://ldopa.net/2006/01/14/glterminal/  Hella awesome.@mankoff it seems easy, but trust me: it's much easier to edit the ebuilds of my Gentoo manually and compile G++ than fix the fink repository (it just does not work for me).@Cristian Awesome terminal programme in Ubuntu. Hope some kind of solution exists in OS X.I checked, and it does not seem to be the case.Supposing you use iTerm 2, would you say that it works "better" than Terminal.app + Visor for a quick "pop-in, do-something, pop-out" workflow? I am a Rails web developer if that helps to visualize my needs.@Christian "fast" is only in USA and some countries.related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5923/how-to-install-an-app-on-iphone-from-a-second-machine/5931#5931I did tried to set wpa-2 as password again, due to my depression, and it didn't work the first time. Then i rebooter my Macbook and now it seems to be working well. It's strange because i've already tried it like a week ago and it didn't worked. Anyway thanks very much.As said below, don't forget to accept your own answer as it's the solution to your question!Love it! Just what I was looking for. Thank you!I thought about that but I was hoping there'd be something less labour intensive :) How would I proceed if I want the current apps and iphone settings I have to be transferred to the other library and to start syncing only with it?There is always emacs if you are already in Terminal, but the learning curve is a bit steep.I can't accept my own answer for another day. Thanks for the reminder though. :)@Vrinek not sure. You could still use Visor and iTerm2.First of all to ensure that in the worst case scenario you can get your iPhone back to its current state, do a full sync on the MBP library, that will create a back up. Then change library and connect your iPhone, to get all your Apps onto your external library right click on the iPhone in the tool bar and select "Transfer purchases".And System 7 before that.is there a way to create an install dvd from my current installed OS ?None that I know of. The OS on the DVDs from Apple are composed of compressed packaged that the installer disk manages, sets permissions upon installation, etc. @Bao's disk image idea is the only other way to go, as well making sure you have a mirror image of your drive for easy backup.Strange - I've been using the method described in the blog post for about a year and never had any issues like that.Authorized it, but didn't work.thks @Philip ; if I want to use an image as @Bao suggests, what should be the format / process ?You can use Disk Utility to make an image of a disk, which makes the process as simple as possible (instructions go beyond the scope of comments). But like @Bao wrote, you need the disk to make the image no matter what if you can't borrow one from someone else.What folder is "stacked"? What are the contents of that folder?Looks fairly promising. Thanks Ian.Goodreader worked for getting the files onto my iPad though I was unable to play them, not sure if that is simply the file itself or how Goodreader deals with them as the "Open with" capability seems to be reserved for third party apps, i.e. I can't open with Videos or iPod.OK, this works. It does break on apps with an apostrophe (and presumably other funny chars in the name). I riffed on your solution and did something similar in Python, which I'll post in another answer - though if that's not the right etiquette, I'm happy to add it to your answer instead (or whatever)."stacks" are the folder views in the dock:

http://cl.ly/4GZT@eliben - I have tried installing the app and then overwriting, and this *does* work in many cases. However, when the app at the App Store is a newer version than the one I had backed up, incompatibilities occasionally arise. This is part of the reason I'm looking for an alternative.I don't have a particular model in mind, but every USB hub has a different "power brick". Find the ones that have more power. Although it may seem like every hub is the same, truth is that some are more expensive  (and thus deliver more power) than others.and its just the regular Downloads folder, there is nothing in it as you can see in the screenshot aboveI'm on Mac OS X 10.6.6, and that's not how it works for me. It appears that they both do the same thing.Just to be clear, you're going to be connecting this drive to your iMac via USB/Firewire and using Mac OS X to share the drive over your network?Actually I'm not quite sure about the apps :) The last time I did that (synced between my old laptop and my older one) I lost just the music and video stuff. The apps stayed intact. Then I just redownloaded the apps from iTunes and it was all fine. But that's just me - I think LC1983's advice is better in terms of recovery :)Actually it works mostly like the second point: Four finger slide - activates menu, lift two fingers, slide, highlight icon, release fingers, tap 1 finger and it activates the highlighted item. The only thing is that the cursor must be over the app switcher popup during the 1 finger tap at the end.@sense I am on OS X 10.6.6 too, but it works for me, I don't know the reason!Brilliant, it seems to work perfectly, thanks.That's correct @Kyle, and I also need to be able to connect to it from a Linux box.@bisko: Cool, I didn't know about the two finger dragging, however, it's that last tap that I'm trying to avoid, especially since it means that I have to navigate the mouse to the center of the screen. In order for me to use this feature, it needs to work efficiently, which is why I'm looking for one of these solutions.Yes, after reading the question I considered that I need the same thing, but I felt that I needed to point an alternative, where may be someone can give an advice for something that does just that - eliminate the last click :)I'll probably take it into Apple, then.thanks for the suggestion!  I'll be working on it over the weekend and hit the answer after I get things goingThanks for your response Martin.

I plugged Broken MBP in a hardwired connection, and gave both interfaces a static IP.  Neither IP is pingable from another device on the network.

I did try the firewall with Stealth mode off, but the result is the same :(I don't see that option. I'm on a standard user account (i.e. not administrator, if that makes any difference).philip do you use pathfinder or something else?@Am1 I just go to the Trash icon in the dock. @Senseful I am on Snow Leopard (10.6.6) I think it is a Snow Leopard only feature.Oh sorry you are right.balexandre, you are looking at the price for the full Windows version of Maxivista, not the iPad version, which is currently $9.99 in the App Store.http://www.fraiseapp.com/ for those of you who may have been wondering. :-)Air Display beta is no longer available.One of the reasons I asked was because I often have the choice of using a free hotspot vs. 3G, and I want to know which one I should use if I care about security. At first I thought 3G is obviously more secure, since there are simple firefox extensions that can pick out passwords of people on the same Wi-Fi network, but how do I know that there isn't someone sitting in the middle of all 3G transmitted data and collecting it all the time? At least with Wi-Fi you need a to be within a certain (small) range and be running software that collects that kind of info.possible duplicate of [How do I stop OS X from writing Spotlight and Trash files to memory cards and USB sticks?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6707/how-do-i-stop-os-x-from-writing-spotlight-and-trash-files-to-memory-cards-and-usb)@Senseful I started doing some digging in the Trash, .DS_Store seems to retain information about recent files' previous locations  (You will have to go in hex, I used Vim's  `%!xxd` ), I am not sure how else to do it right now , when I reach home I will have to try on a older mac (Pre Snow-Leopard)@Philippe: I'm on 10.6.6 too, which is oddIf doing something like Online Banking or purchasing something with my credit card I'd tend to use 3G wherever possible.  But even on a WiFi network, most websites which deal with sensitive data would use encryption such as SSL or TLS which would mean someone on that network would have a harder time trying to steal/intercept your data.  I would say you are more likely to be at risk on free WiFi than 3G most of the time.Alright, I found out the problem, the file was deleted by a 3rd party app, so it doesn't have the Put Back option for some reason. If I delete a file from Finder, it does have the put back option.Thanks for the info, though $9.99 (http://itunes.apple.com/app/air-display/id368158927?mt=8) beats 40 :) and its stable and works fantastic on Windows as well on the Mac!@Senseful yes I realized the missing option when creating a file and manually moving it `mv file ~/.Trash/` maybe the third party apps are doing the same thing ?Please stop saying that MaxiVista costs $40.  MaxiVista for iPad is $9.99, same as Air Display.  (The $40 and $100 prices are for versions of MaxiVista that run on other Windows machines, not on iPads.)Note that Air Display is no longer in beta for PC.http://www.maxivista.com/docs4/09/shop.php remember that you need to include Mirroring if you are comparing the same features with Air Display! When I go to MaxiVista website, and products, that's what I find: http://www.maxivista.com/multi_monitor.htm - What am  doing wrong here, please correct me... I'm lost!@Philippe: That could likely be the problem, thanks for the help!I'm inclined to agree with @Philip on this matter. While it would be nice for the app to remember where it was, saving one less thing (like track position) makes it more responsive to the low memory condition, or closing of the app, etc.Thanks for the info. I'm more interested in how secure non HTTPS data is over 3G, since by definition HTTPS should be secure no matter the connection.With all due respect to your perfectly valid question, you've answered it by saying "If I restart my phone, the leak stops", which is precisely how you could "fix" the problem.Cool, thanks for the link!No worries, I just updated the link to point to the Mini DisplayPort section since that's what you're interested in ;o)Yeah, definitely not shaped as nicely. The ones I found on eBay looked identical to the Apple version (I was fooled until I read the small text). The price can't be beat though! Thanks for the response.doesn't seem to, i get an "unable to resolve host" error if i past in the address copied from sharepointCarrying around the original rescue drive would be one more small device to lose.  The copy is to be the backup of the original.Sorry Peter you're right, I deleted the answer as I misunderstood what the program did.  Good luck!I'm actually trying that application right now, the problem is that you can't bind Cmd+Tab. When you try to, it just switches applications. Although, even if it did allow me to bind it, it wouldn't work very well because if you press cmd+tab and let go repeatedly, it just toggles between two applications rather than cycling through all of your applications.I'm a Fink admin, I can verify that Fink and MacPorts can coexist without any problem, but homebrew will cause trouble unless it's installed in a non-standard location (ie: not /usr/local). I'd recommend that users install both Fink and MacPorts, try them out for awhile, and then decide which they prefer!Most, if not all, of the software I have downloaded has never included an uninstaller in the dmg.One thing AppCleaner doesn't do is remove options in the System Preferences. For example, if the application you want to uninstall has an icon under "Other" in the System Preferences, it will not be removed by AppCleaner. You would have to right click the icon in System Preferences and chose to remove it.@sens I myself use cleanApp , but it's a use full information from AppCleaner TanX man.New content noted.  How can all this be done from the command-line?  What does the cloner do that a cp does not?  Will a dd to a similar sized flash drive do the same?@hotpaw2 - I don't know what would happen if you used cp to be honest but I'd expect dd would allow you to make an exact copy if you bought a USB key of the same size.  the `dd` command should be `dd if=/path/to/olddrive of=/path/to/newdrive bs=100M`.  This wouldn't allow you to store additional data on it though.  Make sure you don't get `if` and `of` the wrong way round or you'll wipe your boot disk.which keyboard layout are you using?PCKeyboardHack (from the makers of KeyRemap4Macbook) can change the caps lock key to any other modifier key, if that's any use.Only works with aTVFrom Apple Discussions: "It seems to be a pretty common problem for anyone with the integrated intel graphics. There are numerous other posts about it on these boards." http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2418690&tstart=0@Jonathan Correct, I thought they had enabled this feature but didn't check.  Answer amended, thanks.@Nathan sadly, it happens also with the NVidia graphics card. It's clearly not hardware but software (the issue disappears if I focus another window)I would be very surprised if it didn't support two finger scrolling. I have no experience with the Magic Mouse, but the two finger scrolling gesture works on Windows 7 with the Magic Trackpad.@Randolph, this is **not** a solution. I want the leak to never occur in the first place.As I said, I respect the question, but I don't think you're going to get an answer because by the sound of things, it's a bug.@Randolph, there are some solutions that I can envisage of: don't install X app, don't open X with Y, and so on. If someone has the same experience as mine and they could have a walkaround. Isn't this the purpose of SE?I'm certainly not arguing with you. Please understand that. If I had an answer, I would write an answer in the "Your Answer" section below. My comment was a suggestion that the only valid way to get around this problem you've identified, is to restart your phone.@Randolph, OK. :)That causes the word to be dragged rather than highlightingAre both of the computers on the same network?Have you checked the system.log with the Console app?  Leave it for long enough that it should have gone to sleep, then check the log.  There may be a hint there.it doesn't do anything at all for me except unselect the wordcheck out bettertouchTool.  Not positive, but I bet there's something in there that would do this.Please add some description of what you're looking for.  "Inverted" window colors is a bit ambiguous.@Martin Wickman: Do you have any of the following programs installed? Things, VMware Fusion, Caffeine (running or not), LaunchBar?@Jeff Snider: I just did and did not see anything enlightening. I've seen "such and such prevented a system sleep" or "waking as scheduled for program," but not here.This isn't exactly what you want to achieve but it has the same net effect in terms of balances.  Purchase an iTunes gift card for whatever amount you wanted to spend on the credit card.@Calavera: I installed it and played around with it's settings for other problems I have. I don't see any settings that might help with this problem though.You have to start the drag almost immediately after the second double-tap.  It works believe me, I just did it.  I know if you delay at all it drags the word instead. I added a link to macworld.com explaining it too@FriedWishes: yes. And the problem was solved. See below. :)That's weird... after reading what you wrote, I tried it and it worked, however that was the only time I could get it to work. No matter what I try, I can't get the same results.I'm looking for a solution that doesn't need a second key/hand.That works. Unfortunately, though, I like the navigation gesture with three fingers, so I don't want to rebind it.@calavera: I was able to reproduce that result if I disable one finger dragging in the settings. @Griffo: If I use clicks instead of taps, everything on the macworld article works as described. However, it does not work with taps no matter how many times I try or how fast I do it.I just tried it with clicks instead of taps and it worked.  click-click-pause click-click-drag works for me.  You need 'Tap to Click' enabled in preferences.  Do you have that enabled?I dont think this is true, at least as of 10.6 or later. Just tested it to be sure :-)+1 I has the same questionNot what you asked for, but could be useful to someone: To perform this change globally, press `ctrl-opt-cmd-8`.@Senseful,@Griffo: I have tap to click, but none of the dragging settings, set to true.  Probably need to use the drag setting.@Senseful: i don't think you even need a double-tap at the end.  it selected for me with a single tap on the second word.@Griffo Works! But a little complicated.. at least for me@Senseful: same here, except it didn't even work oncePerhaps this is almost same as what @Griffo has said, but for me the other one was easier to do. I am not very good with taps..@Senseful,@Griffo: Yep, that's what made it work!@Griffo: I have the exact same settings that you have, but it doesn't work.@calavera: I'm confused, you got it to work? I was able to get your results (double tap the second time deselects a word) to work. Not double-tap-and-drag to select whole words (i.e. I still can't get my original problem solved).Added trackpad settings for my MacBook for reference, as I have an older machine than @Griffo@Senseful: my last comment was in reply to myself.  So basically, when I have the exact same settings as @Griffo's above (plus secondary click), I am able to do what he describes.  I have to do it like he says in the comments though... In other words, start dragging as soon as your finger hits the pad on the second double-tap.  So: tap-tap *pause* tap-tap-drag@jtjacques: are you on Leopard (10.5) as well?@calavera: yeah, that's true.@calvera No, Snow Leopard. I just have an earlier model MacBook that doesn't support those fancy new gestures.@Griffo: alright, you were right, it's all a matter of timing on how fast you begin dragging after the fourth tap. If you delay even the slightest (what feels like a millisecond at times), you will drag the word. Could you please update the answer to mention that the dragging immediately after the fourth tap is important?Yeah it's tricky, answer updatedDo you mean that there is no mouse acceleration to begin with? Maybe it's not called mouse acceleration, but I added an example of what I mean in the question.Another thing not removed by AppCleaner is Login Items under System Preferences > Accounts > Login Items.That works, but it makes the mouse incredibly slow :(@Agos US keyboard layoutThat did it, after turning on US Extended keyboard layout. Thanks.I just installed iTerm2 this afternoon, and it's excellent, Much closer to Terminal.app in it's cleanness, but with the extra functionality of iTerm, plus a few extra features of it's own.  GLTerminal is also a lot of fun, but thin on extra features ;)Or, you could undo the jailbreak and have it all working. At no cost.Anyone know how to make this work for zsh?The USB flash drive contains only two files: Install Mac OS X, and Install iLife. When I try to "show the package contents" of the first file, I see a Content folder, and there doesn't seem to be any files called Firmware utility. If I try launching the installer, it says "To set up the installation of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, click Restart."If you use Zsh the TAB completion enhancements will rock your world. Try zsh and .oh-my-zsh.I chose to restart the system and then I was able to access the utility from the menu on top. Thanks for the answer.I'd definitely recommend having a play with Cocoa Emacs.+1 - Didn't know about `automator` good to know ... I suppose ;) - (Generally I use it to run scripts from Finder, so I'm not sure if I'd ever use it the other way around.)!-3 - get's the 3rd item back from now ... !-3:1 get's the first argument from the 3rd item back.I'd recommend zsh + .oh-my-zsh (find it on github) has great git completion (and for many other commands too.) - Also has a bunch of prompt themes specifically tailored to show git status in  a git folder.Imgur is a much better choice than DropBox. Try this script. http://figbug.com/?page_id=29if you tire of long pathnames like this, try `locate airport` - you could run it with `$(locate airport | grep 'Priv')`Well, if it respected line-breaks it might even be useful ;)  -- Try `cupsfilter` instead to convert to PDF, it also skips the unnecessary PS-PDF conversion.FYI - iTerm2 has an instant replay function, very useful for making screencasts.just alias rm to rm -i : `alias rm='rm -i'`you don't need xargs for these, mate will accept STDIN.+1 Yes, thanks for this one, a great find.+1 for suggesting `unar` without using it's name. ;)Esc is never a modifier, it's just going into "Escape" mode when you press it, consider it a modal way of doing things, unlike shift/ctrl/meta etc. (in the Readline scheme of things anyway.)I don't know about the 4-port, but the 7-port you linked to specifically says, "(Note that the hub cannot charge iPad and iPhone 4)." "High-power" means (as you pointed out) 500mAh, but the iPad requires significantly higher.@Phil Calvin: Nope, none of them. I'll check the logs more carefully.@Phil Calvin: If we assume there is an app blocking sleep, wouldn't it be possible to debug this by setting a breakpoint on `kIOMessageCanSystemSleep` or something like that? Ie the message OS X sends to each app checking if they can be put to sleep?+1. Writer somehow inspires me to write, even if iPad as a device isn't optimal for thatWhich Air do you have? The larger one has an SD card slot, which can also be used as a boot drive.I'm worried that when I set it back, my settings (e.g. FileVault) may have changed by then, so I want to understand how this setting works to make sure that I don't make a mistake when restoring this setting.It's worth noting that it's still alpha, though it seems stable enough to me.I also liked Tweetie better in some aspects, but unfortunately it doesn't support native retweets.I was afraid of that. Thanks for testing.@Ian @Kevin, I was wondering if you managed to get this up and running and if you encountered any issues?Nice app! I'll give it a try. PS: you should change the link to the site's official URL: http://kiwi-app.net/@Dori Ah, missed that part. Darn. 500mA is the max supported by the USB spec, so anything higher is Apple doing their own, non-standard thing. What's even more odd is I my iPhone 4 charges just fine on my Belkin USB hub that I got for $30 at Best Buy several years ago.Then how are other sites, such as iLounge, able to report it?Alfred is brilliant, better than quicksilver in my opinionQuicksilver is great but it's no longer in development.  the new Alfred app is very similar, supported and in development too.  I got it on the Mac App store and it's replaced Quicksilver for me@Martin Wickman: According to this article (http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showpost.php?p=60669&postcount=18), disk activity at least once a minute (which I'm definitely seeing) is enough to prevent sleep. If I wait for a chance calm minute, it sleeps fine. For me, `launchd` and `mdworker` are the culprits, but I don't understand why they're so active compared to other installations.@Dori why the [finder] tag?@calvera: true, but double tap means you can be less accurate about cursor position (anywhere in the word rather than exactly at the end). Fitt's Law rules.@senseful: press shift with your pinky and double tap with your thumb? ;-)Apple says what I pasted as an image, everyone can do whatever they want, but, they been warn.@Dori : MBA 11, smaller one with no SD slot.Thanks for the comment Phillip. Where is it documented that "full Unicode set in the keyboard doesn't exist"? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Much appreciated!Awesome, I didn't see that setting. Thanks. It should be noted that this works even with the four finger gesture, if you want. Also, to get it to work with a three finger gesture, you need to keep the swipe to navigate feature of the trackpad feature enabled.I have 300 GB hard drive and have over 113 GB leftWhat happens when you remove the sim card?How large a Boot Camp partition are you trying to make? Disk usage isn't linear: 1/3 free space doesn't necessarily mean its contiguous, which is why the installer must move files.Finally hit me that you already tried reinstalling OSX.

Can be great for isolating external network/internal network, and firewalling.on my newer macbook, all I needed to do was use Keyboard preferences to disable caps lock, and then install PCKeyboardHack to map caps lock (I mapped it to Esc for use in vim)Macintosh:~jon$ find / -type f -name DGAgent* -print

I would recommended doing a full restore.I don't of any publicly available, but in the documentation available to developers there are lists of keyboards available.

find: /net/localhost: Operation timed out
find: /net/broadcasthost: Operation timed outshould I reinstall Drive Genius?OK the two timed out messages are expected.  You could try deleting `/Library/Application Support/DriveGenius` and everything in that directory.  That might solve your issue because that appears to be where the app is locatedI deleted that folder but still didn't work :(Did you empty the trash?  It's not deleted until trash is emptied.  Also, make sure you rebootyep it is emptiedFirst you can't compare the iPad and iPhone reception, they have different aerials, though I see you have compared two iPads. Second, I bought an iPad at Xmas and the 3G in that has NEVER worked. I am still trying to get it resolved :(So you still get the error complaining that DGAgent quit unexpectedly?Nice! It let's you modify a Private.xml file and map your own keybindings which is exactly what I did to make it work.@Henry - Thanks for the comments. The point of comparing the iPhone to the iPad was not a comparison but to prove there is signal in the area. Some of my past experience with Apple fans and Apple itself is a tendency to presume that I'm *"just not in an area that has signal"* instead of assuming that I'm reasonably intelligent and that I have verified as a fact that there is signal available where my iPad finds none or only 1 bar.@Henry - It's interesting that your 3G doesn't work either. I wonder how many others have this issue. Is this a flaw that Apple simply won't acknowledge?Yup.  Make sure the wattage is the same and you'll be fine.  They both fit.Good question @MikeShinkel, hope you get it sorted out.  Surely the evidence you've shown here should be of value to Apple?  Have you provided them with this evidence?@Griffo - Thanks. I haven't taken the photos to the store yet but that's my next step. I just feel like they assume I'm guilty *(i.e. that I'm not actually having the problem)* and that I have to prove my innocence *(i.e. that I do in fact have this problem.)*  In my past dealings with other companies like Dell, when I said I had a problem _they fixed or replaced it, no questions asked_. **It's very frustrating to think that Apple puts so much burden on it's customers**; it tells me next time I have a problem I'll probably have to deal with more of the same.I swear I saw this at one point, but I didn't link to it and finding it again is appearing to be a difficult task. Sorry.you linked back to this question..Thanks @Harv I've updated the link nowCongratulations to the moderator on closing the question. What "exact duplicate" pray tell this is? And as long as someone can name an actual hub that charges the iPad, like the MacBook does, this is a valid and open question.Significantly different instructions for iOS 4.X here: http://modmyi.com/forums/file-mods/726701-how-overclock-iphone-3g-3gs-4-a.htmlGood point actually, I hadn't kept up to date on changes in this process with newer phones.  I'll amend the answer.  Thanks @mankoffyes the error pops up over and over again when i click ignore button and relaunch buttonsWere there any other files found containing `DGAgent` from that command I gave you earlier?  Anything after `/net/broadcasthost: Operation timed out`?  Did you see my updated answer above in relation to the Skype errors?@Ky;e - iPhone 4s don't need anywhere the amount of power that the iPads do to charge (sadly).@Dori Right, which is why the "cannot charge ... iPhone 4" part is confusingThat's not what I mean. If you abruptly disconnect during a sync and reconnect, you will see a message saying "Verifying iPhone..."How did you defrag it?  I had a similar problem once (with shrinking a volume, but not for Boot Camp) and [iDefrag](http://www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag.php) did the trick.On the iPhone or on iTunes?those are the errors and nothing after when it timed out.  I also still get the same error on skype as well.+1 for FileBrowser. I have used it quite a bit to get at SMB shares on both my MacBook Pro and Windows PCs.How do you sync a second iphone, it automatically asks to set up a new iphone acc?What type of Mac are you using?  Does it have an Intel processor?Dude you are a saint! I was having a similar problem, thanks@Chori: no problem, glad it helpedStrange, because it should use the Intel chipset drivers to run the USB. Have you updated to the latest Boot Camp?I don't think the Windows Genuine Advantage kicks in until Windows is loaded, and this sounds like it's in the pre-boot environment.How about if you throw a big enough fit in the store, especially if it's full, and hope they'll do a swap-out? :-) Seriously though, if you use your photos as evidence, I think you'll have better luck. FWIW, the 3G iPad I have works fine, but it's still quite new.@Randolph Potter - I'd be afraid they would call the police and have me thrown out...  Seriously.What country do you live in? Whatever happened to standing up for yourself, demanding to speak to managers, threatening to sue, and all the things that made America great?@Randolph Potter - USA, and I *have* spoken to the store managers and for my efforts I got the great run-around. As far threatening to sue, I've learned that it's best to only threaten to sue if you are ready to immediately follow thru with it, and I'm not going to sue over this. Instead, I'm going to go to a highly visible place on the web and ask about it in hopefully rational terms so that maybe somebody at Apple will see it and resolve the matter, or that someone who knows how to get Apple to pay attention will suggest an approach. You know, some place like the AskDifferent website.Good on you for being rational about the whole thing. I would have lost my nut by now.@Randolph Potter - Thanks. Well I hope at least *your* iPad 3G keeps working even if mine doesn't.Give it thirty days :-)I do #1 (though not on a mac pro), and I'm a (power) home user.yep, I've updated it inside windows to version 3.2 and have checked and updated windows itself, but it didn't helpSorry buddy, afraid not. Best think to do would be to get a splitter cable for your computer speakers etc, if your going that far you might as well get a nice dock too.Yes, sometimes the options are quite obscure ;) Thanks for the tip Frederiko!Yeah, thought so. It might be of interest for some reader. But in the free "hotspot vs. 3G" point, for me at least, you wouldn't trust there isn't end to end encryption. Security between my computer and the hotspot or cell tower, is not enough if after that the data is unencrypted.It's not WGA kicking in, it's the bootloader looking for firmware which doesn't exist and it pauses because it can't find it.Yeah @Fake_Name I do too but most users wouldn't go to the trouble and those that might probably don't need to ask this questionThanks,I got it.Thanks a lot! That did the trick.And the point in this is? Theres a speaker button right there in the main screen.@Phil: I can honestly say I have no clue anymore what's causing it. That article is from 2003 so who knows if it still apples. I think the `kIOMessageCanSystemSleep` should be the way to go for the system rather than keeping timers on disk accesses. Lots of programs needs disk access regularly (mail, twitter, adium etc). So if that was true, no-one should be able to sleep their Macs. Btw, I have `mdworker` and `launchd` more or less constantly producing output with `fs_usage`.Your question is not very clear.  What do you want to do with your phone and Mac?  What are you looking to do by connecting them together?i edited my question ;)Because a bad person at my home activated a MAC address filter and he won't give my HTC internet access.Thanks, great answer! Nevertheless, I couldn't find any information regarding disabling hdds in sleeping mode at apple.comAll the links above are from apple.comThe problem is I don't have an ethernet cable and I can't plug it into the router (don't ask why ;(). Is there really no other way? I could give my ipod touches internet connection (I have heard there's a usb tether tool) to my mac and then i could share it to my HTC. wouldn't that work? Do you know such a tool for ipod touch 2g 4.0 jailbroken?I also recently discovered the GUI port of vim for the Mac, and I must say I really love editing C and C++ code in it. It also helps to better edit makefiles, since Xcode hasn't really got any support for makefiles. I only write Objective-C code in my Xcode editor, since Xcode has phenomenal text completion for Cocoa and the vim editor lacks this.There is a USB tethering option but only on iPhone because it allows your MacBook to use your 3G connection on your iPhone.  It doesn't allow your MacBook to use your iPhones WiFi connection.  I can't think of another way really apart from spoofing a MAC address but that wouldn't be easy (probably almost impossible) on a HTC.:(. Spoofing the MAC address does only work on a rooted HTC Desire :( I already tried it. :(Yeah, definitely not a fan. Very un-Mac-like.You need to give a better explanation of what benefit it gives to users. The only thing you've told them is that it is "cross-platform", not very useful at all.Sounds like you need to negotiate with whoever is in control of the router :o)what's the drag to eject method?Also a very expensive answer...Yup but if he's got all those other expensive Apple devices what's one more?May be good if you're a mac user trying to become an emacs user, but not good if you're an emacs user new to a mac. Use native Emacs built for mac instead.Damn PdaNet. It can't share the mac's connection only the android's :(That sounds like it might work +1Haha was just writing an answer with a link to the same page.  You were quicker on the draw +1 ;)I see you're quite a big contributor to this site, so I had to get in first :-)Yeah I've had a quiet weekend just answering questions on this site.  Don't think I'll be keeping up this kind of pace for long thoughok i setted up all. My Mac can go into the internet over my ipod. My htc joined the network from my mac but i can't access the internet it just loads :(. sry can't vote up at the moment because i'm not registered.+1 DVD sharing!Yup good answer.  I was trying to find that article.  I was thinking it was 'target disk mode' but you found the right one.This is the one that Apple recommends. IIRC, Jobs mentioned it at the keynote when they released the Air.Even with degradation, it's a ridiculously powerful upgrade.  It improved the performance of my machine to such a degree that boxes without SSDs feel like 486s to me now.  Unless you fill the SSD quickly, degradation isn't even much of an issue.  And if you do, you can always do a backup, wipe (fill the drive with zeroes), and restore to bring performance back to the way the drive was when it was brand new.see also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3063/replacing-superdrive-with-secondary-storageand http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3772/replace-macbook-pro-hard-disk-with-ssdYes - you're right.  That changes it into a bundle, but still not something that iPhoto will read/recognize as an iPhoto library.  Any more ideas?@calavera - sure, as I said in the beginning, "[it] will be significantly faster". My usage of drive capacity is on the high end, so I wouldn't see the benefits for very long, and (again, personally) I would find the backup / wipe / restore process tedious.Just wondering what version of iPhoto you are currently using/what version your backup was made from?@dtlussier hmm.  I imagine you're selecting this folder when iPhoto asks you to select an iPhoto library, and it's just rejecting that folder as a viable option, yes?@dtlussier You could of course create a new library and import all the photos.  I'm still trying to figure out how to associate a folder or bundle with a specific app.Check my answer below, but in a nutshell the playcount reset bug is fixed in iTunes 10.1.2That doesn't work for a boot camp installation, see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2298@dtlussier - I copied my iPhoto Library, and removed the extended attributes (a piece of metadata called com.apple.finderInfo).  It then showed up as a folder rather than a proper iPhoto Library.  I then fired up iPhoto holding option, and selected this folder as my iPhoto Library.  It accepted it and changed the type, putting the metadata back, and all was well.  I suspect this is what needs to happen in your case as well, it looks like as long as the files are there, iPhoto will do the work for you.@RandolphPotter: that makes sense... I personally use it as the system drive, but all of my "data" (home folders) are on a HDD.Must stress the "allow this network to be extended" step.  People always miss this and then wonder why they get an error when trying to set up the extender.@Cawas: i added another way to search the answers into the question.  It involves using `inquestion:this` in the search field.thanks, I should have read manual first :)Sorry, I guess I should have stressed my priorities a bit. I'd like a device to carry on me so I can listen to music while walking, or waiting in queue. So the iPad is out of the question. Browsing is not as important. I was thinking of a quick look over the news or twitter. I'll change my question to reflect that.is there any logic to this limitation.  It seems like an obvious featureSometimes it's quicker to ask on SE ;o)@ooo, I think there is just no way to push updates and have iTunes on the iPhone/iPod Touch automatically download them in the background. This is probably to avoid big silent downloads on an iPhone when using 3G and has most probably been replicated on the iPod to keep behaviour the same.@ooo I think Neil hit the nail on the head. There are also jailbreak solutions for subscribing if that helps, but I find just subscribing via RSS works for me - easier on an iPhone the iPod though I suppose.I like it, but I find it crashes a lot for me. Anyone else?The SSDs which are sold for use in Apple computers (like OWCs) are tweaked to run without needing TRIM. They overprovision the unused space and use more aggressive GC algorithms in firmware. In summary, the performance won't degrade over time.Is the issue that it appears Jailbroken, when viewed in person, or over the network.  I assume the question is about the over network view.@Zan - that may be so, but they are noticeably slower than competitors' drives, per the URL I posted above.I must respectfully point out that "for a while" is a subjective period of time, and in my case as a heavy user, I've found noticeable degradation in speed. In some cases, a while could define a year, or six months.Yes, over the network.@Randolph: I read the link and what I got out of it is that the Mac Air SSD is slow. It didn't cover the OWC drives at all. Also, when comparing performance to competitors it would be important to compare to competitors using GC only without TRIM.What model is your Mac, what OS are you looking to install?@Zan - again, a fair statement. What I get from this (and my own anecdotal evidence) is that, over *n* period of time, SSDs with TRIM support are quicker than SSDs without TRIM but with GC, which are faster than the ones without either, which then need a periodic wipe. Apart from that, it's all relative and new territory for us. I still like my black Western Digital spinning drives for decent speed and reliability.It's an iMac Leopard with Processor 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 300GB drive, 4GB memory.mac osx version 10.5I agree with your sentiment on price / performance. I've also updated my answer to take into account garbage collection on SSDs.should i do the reinstall with erasing and formatting disk optionIm not sure they can ever tell over the network.Yes, that's the right way to do it.The iPod Touch has a camera (both front- and rear-facing).@Doug - I agree, Cocoa Emacs is a much better way to go. Even if you're a Emacs noob, you shouldn't really get a non-emacs Emacs, it defeats the purpose of learning a cross platform editor.@Studer - iTerm2 is about the most excellent Terminal I've ever used. (except perhaps GLTerminal ;) )iTerm 2 kicks it's ass (not from the same developer)Sorry, "can't say any good things" about OmniGraffle.@fardjad - +1 for using the Terminal / Automator.The Unarchiver team also provide a command line utility `urar` that uses the same compression library, so you can extract all those obscure formats from a script.Even better see Apple;s technical specifications http://support.apple.com/specs/#ipodtouch@Jon, post that as an answer.Pix pls. Screen caps will help us identify the problem. Also, can you try exporting? Is the problem still there?I've posted it with a nice link to TUAW for the different types of installation.Since it's still throbbing 'processing,' I'm going to wait (perhaps until tomorrow) to see if this is a temporary phenomenon. If so, I'll delete this. If not, I'll post a capture.@Senseful What... that sucks. Why, Apple?Another XLD user here. Simple, effective. [Here's a link to download it](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23430/x-lossless-decoder).You drag a mounted disk (including CDs) to the trash icon in the Dock. It will change to an eject symbol.@Jonathan : The best reason I can think of is that when you're in another app but on a call, you can easily use this method without leaving the app. But yeah, in most cases the obvious button is the easier method.Not directly an answer, but AirFoil allows you to steam audio from your computer an iPhone or other iOS device. http://rogueamoeba.com/ Regarding the real question, the best I can think of would be something that can operate as an AVRCP controller, but I have not been able to find a Windows app to do this.Not why Apple, but why Microsoft.  The Windows installer doesn't know how to work over a network.  It's difficult to even get it to work off a thumb drive.Well, back at launch, the iPod touch did not have Mail or Calendar; they were added in January of 2008 with the 1.1.3 update.thanks i wiped out everyhing and installed new osx and it's gone.  thanks for all your helpThink of "Buckets" or "Jars" as the old time envelopes where you put XX amount of money "saved" for that. The program allows you to automatically fill the "jars" every month and allocate your money.thank you guys things are working wellAgree on the trouble iTunes has with syncing with iOS devices - just did a major cleanup in iTunes of my iPhone, just to have it revert to the mess it was in previously. Tried one more time, and then it worked...frustrating to say the least.But it does mean you've lost your data and will need to restore from backup.You can also go into /Applications and double-click iSync to open it - QuickSilver and/or Spotlight are unnecessary.@ mike, I cannot re-partition the drive, the options are grayed out.  Also the drive is there but it listed as "disk0" which is windows.

@ Randolph, I have time machine and backed it up but when I try to restore, the HD is not listed as a destinationThat option is only available if you already have MobileMe configured@Kyle. I am aware and stated so in my answer, however, I believe it is still valuable for someone that is Googling and may have a MobileMe account.@kyle you are right, but I write the way I always use myself to open Application.What are the cons you speak of? I have 0 problems with Max so far.@VxJasonxV I can't convert some of my audio file that have .wma extension.That's pretty strange, and quite a big con. Not entirely sure what to say about that, I haven't had a problem with anything yet (except DRM'ed/protected audio files).The best solution. I have 2 Airport Express devices that run my Wireless N. Worth every cent, I hardly ever have to touch them.For having everything in a single tool, I would suggest XLD too. Just don't use CDDB for metadata correction. CDDB is a mess and is only better than no metadata. For proper metadata use MusicBrainz, which is also supported by XLD.I vote for Max also. Lately, I've been using SBooth's Rip to rip the CD's to CUE+FLAC and SBooth's Max to convert the FLAC into individual MP3 files. The only con I see is lack of update.Ah, then I must be referring to the one my wife had, and not the latest build.  Great news!@Jon make sure you select the entire drive in disk utility, and not just the partition. It won't be able to change the partition independently, you'll have to do the entire drive.Just got this over the weekend, and I'm very impressed. Currently have a pretty bad cold, and I remember waking with coughing fits a few times during the night. Because I was using this app, I could tell what time they were and how long they lasted. It also wakes me at the time I want, and its been easier to wake up, because its not in the middle of a sleep cycle. Pretty cool.Thanks for the reply. You use Google calendar and you enter events to the Google calendar of iCal, or can you really sync events from the iCal to Google calendar and then have both? I hope you understand what I mean... Btw, I have three calendars in my iCal: home, work and holidays. I would like to have same thing on my phone and Gmail. I did the following: I copied all the events to Gmail calendar and then synced it to iCal. But then I had to delegate something and it looked really bad.. Can you explain exatly what you did and maybe put a screenshot of your iCal app?I bought into the angry birds hype, but quickly got over it. Realized it was just a trial and error game with a good physics engine, not exactly my forte. A great time waster nonetheless.@calavera woot! (I think) I wish I could just add features like that. :D+1 for interesting insight on HTTPSlove logmein too!Great, thanks. I wasn't expecting to overclock the phone but limit functionality maybe. For example remove unused characteristics like folders, or any stuff that make it slower. Kinda downgrading to 3.x but having compatibility with new appsJust to re-phrase, you mean that by company policy you're forbidden to add files to dropbox which is the limiting factor on its usage for you, right?Amen to that. @moof You could also try convincing your management/IT to encrypt sensible files on your end regardless of what server is being used. After all, that's more secure than trying to enforce some policy on people *not* bringing files outside the company. I'm pretty sure every file you are worried about is already out of companies servers one way or the other.Sebastian, did you ever find a solid solution to your problem?@eliben Specially after the edit, I think this is a very good question. And jailbreaking doesn't make anything slower.What makes you believe the network provider can see if an iPhone is jailbroken (and nothing else) over the network?+1. And if they can see you got a jailbroken iphone, what can they do about it? jailbreaking is legal after all.interesting question. I never saw this behavior on mine.I always thought skype used any open port because it just works anywhere everytime, behind proxies and firewalls unless it's blocked for specific traffic or per application on its own machine.Probably it is still integrated with your browser. What browser are you using?Try following the [official uninstallation instructions](http://wiki.eltima.com/user-guides/downloader-macos/uninstall.html).@anyone can this be done using the command line on mac?Once you've added your Google account on your Android device, it's dead-simple to sync the calendars.You might find this question on the Android site about syncing desktop Outlook calendars and contacts with Google and Android helpful: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/1673/sync-setup-question-android-outlook-2010-gmail-calendar-and-contactsI still like DropBox, but good to know.Kod looks interesting, but it is nowhere near powerful enough for me to switch from TM at present.+1 for iTerm2..No. I'm talking about the Bookmarks view that popups in Safari on an iPhone. I was pretty clear this is an iPhone issue in the question.You were, but since I don't have an iPhone, and I do have an iPad, I was wondering if it was a similar iOS feature.See SuperUser question http://superuser.com/questions/126642/throttle-network-bandwidth-per-application-in-mac-os-xAt Windows installation time you only have the hardware available that the Windows installation media supports, and networking isn't one of them.@Lizzan Yeah iTunes honestly sucks with syncing. It keeps telling me that my iPhone has like 5GB free but when I try to sync 1 more 5MB song to it it tells me it needs like another 124MB.@Carmine, comparing \TeX to Word is not fair to either.It's getting there!I just test this, WOW I really love this one.bounty awarded. So for the delay man. I thought accepting your answer gave you the bounty.Then it insists on reloading that page when I re-enter the app. Which isn't really much faster (though I never considered leaving about:blank open).Cool. Too bad I'd have to jailbrake the phone. That there exists a sol'n to this suggests I'm not alone in thinking this behaviour is annoying. Small comfort.Pity this can't be done but the about:blank workaround is decent and doesn't appear to suffer from the DNS lag that leaving a "real" page open incurs when you re-open Safari and it insists on resolving and reloading that page again.But it doesn't hang while it is reloading. You can do other things (stop the reload, type in a URL, search, etc.) When it is opening the bookmarks, the GUI freezes, which is more annoying.Thanks for satisfying my curiosity! Of course, the link aggregation thing looks cool :)No dice - thanks thoughlooks like it says on the page that it doesn't support music playbackagree..........Please separate that last sentence into another question, and you'll get an answer (and possibly more rep).It says "Classic Environment" is no longer supported.  Does that mean I don't have Rosetta?  I thought I did.  I'm running Snow Leopard.@Dori: good idea... now I have to find such a placeI just called Apple and it seems like this might work. They recommended I make a Genius bar appointment for it. By the way, do you happen to have the link to the instructions you used to create the USB stick you mention?thanks! looks so cool :)@Ian no worries, thanks. i really don't mind rep that much :) I would have liked the other contributors to add info and win this, we need more people :) Thanks anyway. Glad you fixed it.@Senseful yes, I remember using Google and picking up this ARSTechnica article: http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2009/12/-the-usb-flash-drive.arsFinally, I've managed to fix my problem! Thanks! The link to http://viperfx07.blogspot.com is great!Ivan, I have edited the answer with a few more pointers. Seriously, avoid the guides on the web, the current iCal software makes it very, very easy.I know it's hard to believe but the drive does not allow me to click on the plus or minus buttons because all buttons on the page are grayed out and not active at all.  Same goes to "first aid" and "erase" tabs.Thats good to hear well done :)yes i tried both main drive and the partition and that didn't workThat's a very interesting idea. The only thing I find is that say I'm using "disk A" and I delete something that I added while having "disk B" as the main drive, iTunes ignores it and doesn't ask me if I want to discard or keep the original file.Great question!I've tried something like that and it still didn't do it. I'm starting to suspect that the culprit is the AppleTV and how it interprets the lists from iTunes because I tagged and labelled everything and I've tried changing tags to trick the AppleTV, but nothing's worked so far. :(`say -vz Droid` is deliciously ironic. XDTry this. http://lifehacker.com/5747990/use-iphone-explorer-to-back-up-ios-applications-without-itunesGreat! You help me as always :)Haha that's cool ;)Did you try this or were you just wondering?Is it possible to post a screenshot or even a photo of your screen?DaisyDisk is brilliant! +1Although im not sure how much battery MYWI uses.I have MYWI, but I'm not sure how this is going to help me use GPS only?...Great list! That is certainly very useful to know.Great classification! I was actually looking for something like that. Very good to know.thanks luke, i'll try it outin order to use gps you need edge or 3g on. airplane mode turns everything off except for wifi. mywi lets you use your 3g/edge as a wifi connection, allowing you to use it even when in airplane mode.   I have tried this with my phone and it seems to work.@mrwooster I had major issues as well. In addition, I'm not sure how I would do a restore from the operating system installation menu (which scares me). At this point I think that Dolly Drive (see post below) is the best option.I can use GPS without the sim card in my phone, so I'm fairly sure I don't need 3G or edge to use wifi. Turning on MyWI would also help burn through the battery, so not quite the solution I'm after. Thanks anyway.Thanks @Am1rr3zA for the previous edit but I discovered my answer didn't work so I amended it. ;o)I think this is technically impossible. I would suggest posting a new question looking for tips to maximize battery life and then follow those instructions.while it is strictly right that iOS can be synced to only one iTunes, there are ways to sync iPhone with more than 1 computer as long as all of them have the exact same library (to trick iOS).I have to agree, I've switched from QuickSilver to Alfred (with their PowerPack) and have not looked back. It's faster, integrates well, and is being developed pretty rapidly.What is your definition of "fast", and why if you can create an N connection would you want the B/G?Oh? It's not working for me. I shared the burner on my macbookpro, and idvd on the mini is oblivious.I don't have an answer, but I've had the same problem (actually, with my volume control, but same idea).I experience the same symptoms as Senseful, but have never updated or restored my device. The linked Apple support article explains the need for recalibration, but the quoted paragraph is IMHO not the answer; it just says that the problem may be worse than it already is after an update or restore.Can you access your Macbook Pro over the network otherwise? Supposing you have file sharing or screen sharing turned on on the MBP, can you see those options fine on the mini?Despite the title, [Can I connect more than one external monitor to the new MacBook Air?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3894/can-i-connect-more-than-one-external-monitor-to-the-new-macbook-air) isn't only about the Air, making this one a virtual dupe of that.Okay, thank you so far! Would it work with a Power Mac G5 for example? What OS version do I need?Try taking a look at the answers to [Don't want Folx become my default downloader](http://superuser.com/questions/58346/dont-want-folx-become-my-default-downloader) (on Super User) and see if one of them helps.It should be in SysProfiler there. See mine here: http://i.imgur.com/LxNDT.png (ignore the Razer Naga; that's just a mouse). Worth noting that reinstalling Snow Leopard isn't really that big a deal; it preserves all your files and settings.@mseo - a PowerMac G5 is *not* a current Mac. Apple introduced PowerMacs in 2003, and discontinued them in 2006. The current equivalent is the Mac Pro, but that's probably more machine than you need.The only thing missing is more shortcuts like a shortcut to move files around in the dual pane modeCan't. I am using it in India. I can use it only after unlock.Then, why do people install Pushfix to have working GPS after jailbreaking?What finger do you put on those keys? Do you often put that finger in your ear?The laptop is from 2006. This won't be a free repair.True it won't be. After 5 years, however, it's probably time for a new computer anyway :)@Diango Hardly ever? I've got a Cisco router and never touch it. Seems to me like Apple isn't even the best brand to select for routing equipment and the markup is a bit ridiculous.To support the latest version of iOS you need snow leopard.I think must use CTRL+fn+F4.Update: I tried putting it into "Recovery Mode" followed by "DFU Mode" but to no avail. http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=1034I'm also getting an error in iTunes stating "iTunes could not check for an update to the carrier settings for your iPhone. An unknown error occurred (1631)." I understand that this is a common error as of late with the iPad but I haven't found any info about it regarding the iPhone.A friend of mine just told me the same thing happened to him. He went to the apple store and ultimately got a replacement iphone from them. Not good news but it's the next step for me.if you're lucky, they won't have iPhone 2G and you'll get a 3G or 3GS :) A friend of mine got a new macbook that way because of a faulty webcam and a shortage of display.Why the latest one? From what I've seen it just added some features that I'm not really interested in. Can you expand on that? What do you like of the latest version? What advantages does it have over the previous ones?Do you try it in a bright room? Sometimes I need to block the light sensor to be able to turn on the keyboard backlight.+1 For those. Sadly none really does what the OP wants which is real time monitoring of network traffic by App. Been looking for this myself for some time to no avail :S@Mankoff that'd be a lot of oil, lol :)As a suggestion to Mims H. Wright - first try to restore the phone to factory state, without any backups. Then if it doesn't work, try the above procedure. // And I also want to say that I am may be one of the few with bugged baseband chip and had some trouble with moving between versions of the baseband. But mostly if the backup is the problem, you don't need to do anything more than just manually sync your iPhone after restoring to factory state.You're probably right Kevin, Apple wouldn't be the best brand for routing equipment but the question was about compatibility and I think the airport extreme offers the user assurances in this regardbecause, if you read the comments, only the latest version is stable... plenty of glitches in StreamToMe prior to the latest version, where AirVideo was always very stable. And, I most say that AirVideo spend more in marketing :)Just FYI http://www.no-ip.com has the same service :)@Benjamin: I also disagree. Having used Mac for 7+ years, I still prefer the Windows way for doing pageup/down and moving to end of line. Maybe because I use a "Win" keyboard (Razer BlackWidow) or maybe because I learned to use computer with DOS and later Windows 3.11. But in any case, my hands are used to the WinWay. :)things has toooo much featrures..it's not simple anymore. Wunderlist is really simple and VERY powerful.@Manish my point on the answer is that I never heard of such thing and I agree on your awkwardness about it. They shouldn't be related as much as they seem to not be related to me, from everything I ever saw about iPhones. ... (some time passed) ... Reading about pushfix on http://www.pushfix.info/notifications I can see now your problem is about hacking iphone activation and that "pushfix" is a generic tool that fix that along with issues that hacking brings.This is possible at least on android... So I would hope there's anything similar to iPhone as well.So how is it done on android?Mankoff,

when I run your suggestion:

    sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist

it seems to run fine and even the sharing preferences gui is updated correctly when refreshed, however the connection is actually not working.  If I run the command again it even fails because it thinks its already loaded.

Also, if I run the "top" command to see the process running i do not see "InternetSharing" but if I start it in the preferences gui I will see the "InternetSharing" process actually running and the connection works.

Any ideas why I am hNot sure why you get that behavior. I see "InternetSharing" in top (or easier, **ps aux | grep -i internet**).I'm running OS X 10.6. If you have a different version maybe that is why...Also, this should probably be a comment to my answer, not an answer in itself. Might want to delete the answer...Yea, certainly this should be a comment to your answer, but for some reason I am not able to comment on there answers unless someone has already made a comment.  Maybe because I am a new user.    I am running OS X 10.6.4.  Another thing I noticed is that when I launch internet sharing in the preferences gui is that the process natd (network address translation daemon) also gets started.  I'm wondering if I also need to launch this process, currently investigating how to do this, there seem to be complex arguments needed to start this process.mankoff,  when you run the command do you also get the other processes started, like bootpd and natd?  These process are started when I start internet sharing from the GUI, but no processes start when I execute the command.  I'm starting to think the process is crashing because the other process are not present.  That would also explain why Internet Sharing is gets checked in the gui put the process is actually not running.@MikeZ: I converted these to comments for you.  Since you don't yet have enough reputation to comment in all places on the site, what you can do is create a new question and hopefully others can help you as well as mankoff.  This will help you gain enough reputation to post comments everywhere.

Is this correct?@Juan yes, i'll update my answerThis is happening after he's been using it closed. There's a corresponding oily spot on the screen. Sounds like something from the laptop to me.There have been several discussions about which Mac to buy for beginning iOS development on the various SE sites and the Mac Mini is the favorite choice by far. Even a Mac Mini has more upgradeable parts than an Air. Just the screen sizes on the Air alone would make software development of reasonable complexity more difficult than it needs to be.If you want a *free* quicksilver replacement your only choice is Alfred. It doesn't do all, but it's free. In my opinion, LaunchBar is much more mature and complete, but it's not free.`iftop` might be useful for you. Does realtime monitoring (not shaping), and by host (not app).Mainly the retina display, Facetime, speed boost, HD video recording, gyroscope for more precise motion control & front camera makes self portraits easier. It's also thinner and very likely has little better battery life. With a lot of emphasis on the retina display, it's sooo nice.+1 to LaunchBar. It's one of those apps that's worth the price of admission. I've been using [their nightly builds](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/nightly.html) which are very stable and add some new features here and there. Great product. Sometimes you get what you pay for.@Am1rr3zA It depends on what kind of keyboard you have.Shopping questions are generally not allowed on SE. And I just answered a similar question to this one on audio.se.com: http://audio.stackexchange.com/questions/726/how-to-hook-up-guitar-to-mac-proThanks; this is exactly what I want!  How did you re-map it?  I don't see it in the keyboard shortcuts list in System Preferences.  If I were able to map this function to ?+tab, it would solve all of my problems.It's the 4th one down in Keyboard & Text Input.  I'm not sure if you can remap CMD-TAB, but you could set it to ALT-CMD-TAB or whatever you like.  (To do the actual remapping, click on the ^F4 in the keyboard shortcuts list.  That section should turn editable and you can press whatever key combination you want to use.)I just noticed that whatever shortcut you use, adding SHIFT will reverse the cycling order.  I use CTRL-backtick so pressing CTRL-SHIFT-backtick will cycle through the windows in reverse order.I was using iLife 09 when I had trouble, but now it is working with iLife 11.THIS IS AWESOME. And SO MUCH better than Ctrl+Shift+G or whatever it is... (hence why it's so much better). I wish I could up-vote you 230986 times!Just some clarification, what app do you use when using your iPhone as a GPS only?@Lizzan So given these troubles do you have any ideas on how to avoid those cases?Wow! Excellent answer!@Cawas - Although there may be apps which claim to monitor battery usage by application on Android, that doesn't mean they work.  There are also apps which claim to provide x-ray vision.  Battery power is not something which you can just hand out to applications in chunks like memory.  It depends on too many variables to be determined accurately.Do you get the boot sound or does it stop before that?When you say that you tried to verify permissions but to no avail, what do you mean?  Did you verify permissions but still couldn't boot or could you not verify permissions?I've heard about this method. I've reproduced all the steps several time - my persistent ID on Mac is the same as on PC, but, unfortunately, iTunes still asks for erasing data.Normally GPS Motion X - I like it because it let's me pause, close the app and open it up again - I close the app and put in airplane mode overnight when I go tramping. I'd use Runkeeper Pro in the past as well, but now I just upload the GPS logs from GPS Motion X when I get home again.anytime ;)Okay this was a touch one! Your answer had lots of pretty screen shots *and is actually closer to what I asked*, that is, this is the replacement for the previous feature I was asking about. But, Tim answered first, he needs the rep more, and I actually prefer his method (even though I asked how to do it your way!) SO, I had to accept his answer. :-( I upvoted you though!@Josh It's fine ;) Glad you found your solution! I upvoted him too.+1, great answer!+1, good answer. You should also be able to do `open -a /Applications/Stuffit\ Expander.app /path/to/the/file.sit`Other suggestions that might motivate Apple and would be less work than suing: BBB and take it up with your credit card company.Step Nine is important: You can now launch iTunes and connect your iPhone to the new computer for syncing. Select your iPhone from the list of devices on the left. Notice if now select Manually manage music and videos from the Summary Tab you will no longer be prompted to erase your data, nor will the files on your iPhone be grayed out.Answer added here per feedback.

I'm a long time LaunchBar user (since 2003) with a QS intermezzo. Development may not be the fastest, but the developer provides excellent support (fast answers per email).I disabled indexing using `mdutil -a -i off`, but the problem persisted. Please let me know if that is not functionally equivalent to your suggestion.@Martin Wickman: I am convinced. Do you have a link to good instructions for setting such a breakpoint? I am reasonably good with Xcode's tools, but I've never used them against the operating system itself.This is scary! If I am unable to find a "true" solution, I will most certainly try this product and accept your answer.

However, I am stubborn and not willing to give up just yet. =)@Cawas I would guess it is done on Android (and could be done on iPhone) but the equivalent of `top`. Monitor which apps are using the CPU. You use it 30% of the time, and I use it 10%? Then you are responsible for 75% of the battery use. This is not totally invalid, but it is very fuzzy.Stack Exchange tends to frown upon "shopping request" questions, and yours is borderline. If you rephrase the question to be along the lines of "the graphics card is crashing my Mac Pro" then later bring up that you're open to buying a new one but you aren't sure what to look for, you'll be more likely to get an answer quicker.See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/804668/textmate-how-do-i-find-the-command-associated-with-a-keyboard-shortcutCan you post a screenshot of the Airport panel before you clicked on Access Control?Griffo there's no app, it's native to android. @mankoff I'm not saying it's perfect, just that it's done. I don't think it would be there if it was unrealistic.@Philip nothing keeps you to get an external monitor and keyboard and everything else on the notebook if you will, but you can't take the mini or the iMac on your lap and do some work wherever you go. It sure is a matter of taste in the end and I am just surprised nobody mentioned all the advantages we can get by going "mobile". But from my point of view, screen size is the only considerable downside! :Pguide link is broken to me, right now.Have you tried putting it into dfu mode first?@eliben No, does that delete the data on the phone? If not, I'd be willing to give it a go.You could break out the part about scrolling in windows which are not in focus to a separate question.A good example of when this might bite you: Let's imagine you go to your favorite coffee shop. The owners are so giving that they didn't set a password on their wireless network.

The more people know the risks, the better.it does erase your data. it puts iphone in "restore mode." so you can restore without passcode.This is what I was gonna say. Works fine on Snow Leopard. Supports assignable keyboard shortcuts as well.Awesome. Thanks for sharing what you decided on. For 8 bucks looks great.Note that, by default, the "at" command is disabled. Use "man atrun" to figure out how to enable it.on iTunes......I'd ditto this answer.  The plastics of the keyboard will not do that, though I have seen certain rubberizes/silicone things do it.  If there's not some low-quality keyboard cover involved, then it's something from outside the computer.@mankoff - BBB is an interesting idea, thanks. But the credit card idea won't work as I bought from Georgia Tech bookstore and not directly from Apple. I wouldn't want to screw my alma mater because of Apple.@zevlag - You are kidding, right?Interesting idea, thanks. It'll probably help others but I've got my hands full with other things right now rather than figure out all the jailbreak stuff. And then I can just see them flat denying it because "I voided my warranty."  Note, this is not the first time I've had customer no-service from Apple. It's becoming a pattern...@Mike No, this isn't a joke. There are web stories of this technique working very well. Of course, Jobs isn't active at Apple right now, which is an issue. But if you have a) a valid claim, b) evidence of Apple mis-behaving and c) noise (a good following), this technique has work. I don't think your problem has enough noise yet, and with Jobs out, it might not work. But it is worth a shot.@mankoff - Ah, thanks. Sounds like I have to create a bit more noise then... :)Finally, I've managed to cope with this problem. I've restarted and everything works fine. Thanks a lot!@Cawas It's not@Brian Yeah, a fresh restore should do the trick... Don't restore from backup.yeah I know it's specific, but I was hoping to get (perhaps) some numbers in the right order of magnitude to know if its say 1 hour or 12 hours... and hopefully provide some useful info to people who don't have a power meter ;)hadn't thought of hibernate... that'd definitely improve things, as I'm sure it'd come up much faster than a regular boot-up!Start the computer in *Verbose Mode* (Cmd + v) and see if you can see a specific error message.Good analysis .[Macs don't need to be defragmented](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/829/do-macs-need-to-be-defragmented/), so it wouldn't help.@Dori Yeah I know Macs don't need to be defraged but that's only for files under 20MB. At one point my HDD was down to 100MB free, so I could have large files spread all over the hard drive.@Everybody The Mac Mini simply packs the most power for the buck of any Mac on the market right now. For $300 less than a MBA you will get a 2x faster processor and bigger HDD and more RAM, better graphics, et cetera.Did you tried to repair the HD in Disk Utility and attempt using Bootcamp utility again?Yes I have. No avail.Sorry, I can't insert more than 1 normal link because of low reputation.Thanks. It's nice to know that. I'll just use AccuTerra then.I don't know if it's functionally the same. But it's quick to test so why not try it as described?What can you tell me about installing Windows on a USB drive? Can I use a flash drive or does it have to be a hard drive? This seems like the best solution because VirtualBox won't work with the myDAQ I need to use Windows with. I thought of a USB drive before but dismissed it because I thought Mac OS X couldn't boot from USB flash drives. Thanks for the quick answer!**Please do not crosspost.**Yeah I use DaisyDisk on a daily basis it seems. At one point I had 100MB free  TOTAL. My MBA has a 64GB hard drive. The system occupies about 20GB of that with it's OS and various libraries and stuff, so that's like 44GB free, then -10GB for Xcode and SDKs, then -5GB for Photoshop, Illustrator, Word, iWork Suite, and Aperture. That means I have only used about 8 GB total for all my other applications and files. That's pretty good seeing as my graphic art files are often hundreds of MBs or even a few GBs. These are my job, so without these things my system is completely worthless to me...............But I did think about the SWAP file, like you said. But it shouldn't be 10GB. I looked at it with DaisyDisk and the file is around 3GB, which is instantly deleted if the space is needed. As far as defragmentation goes, Mac OS X will only automatically defragment files under 20MB, which is something that surprised me when I learned it because I originally had the same thought as you. I also don't think that having 10GB free will slow my computer. The MBA has Flash memory, not a regular HDD, so it's not affected by that phenomenon, at least it wasn't when I only had 100MB free.Okay... Well as you have probably noticed 64GB isn't much of space these days. It's fast when it comes to being an SSD but flash storage takes up more volume per bit. If it's absolutely imperative that you can run Windows, maybe you might want to look into getting an external hard drive and using something like Parallels to create a virtual machine on that external hard drive, or storing the stuff you don't necessarily need on the main drive on the external drive.@SeniorShizzle Unfortunately you'll need to do some research on that, however OSX will happily boot from a USB drive as long as it has an EFI boot sector. I would suggest booting from the Windows 7 DVD and seeing if it will allow you to select an external USB drive to install on. I would suggest an HDD because it would have a better chance of being detected.I don't suppose you've tried calling Apple support? This seems like the kind of thing they might be able to help with...@Ian @Kevin, I have been reading a bit more about this and it looks like a lot of people are having problems.  Additionally, dolly drive is actually about 1/3 the price of using S3! I think that its going to be the better (and far simpler) solution.

I vow for SSD.@Martin Wickman: I may have solved this. I had less than 5% free space on my System volume, which was being logged to the system log (but not in a way that made it clear there was a relationship.) Freeing up 50GB solved the issue. Are you also low on free space?You need to copy that character from somewhere else. I'm using Chrome, and what I've said works fine for me.Another thing that will affect the results is the difference between a HDD and SSD.  The SSD will use significantly less power during boot, and will boot much faster.All true, but not specific to using an insecure wireless network.  They would apply to any network connection.@Martin I don't know that it's the general jailbroken state, certainly, but that state does allow apps to run that could very well be getting in the way of the daemon. And really, I am being nice: I'm not saying Chris is a bad guy or something actually assholish like "losers jailbreak" or anything. I really am simply expressing my lack of understanding of how someone expects a hacked device that is -- by the very nature of the hack -- exposing its internals to all kinds of weaknesses that would otherwise be protected, and wants the problem solved while leaving everything exposed.Yes - I think you're right.  Thanks.Thanks for the answer, I just want to know the color of the `*` as is shown in the screen to set the background of the color to the same one to hide the `*` characters.Thanks for the great answer, I added more to my OP. Could you help me with that also?Ah I see, answer updatedDo you have Skype?@martin-marconcini - You asking @Phil-Calvin or me?Before some arbitrary point in time; the jailbroken state is as old as the iOS JB release, but the proximity sensor stopped working independently of that, as well as (as far as I can tell) independently of any software install.  That said, I mentioned jailbreaking specifically so that if someone was aware of a _specific_ jailbreak-related cause for this, they could propose it.

I was actually thinking about making something just like this the other day.As an aside:  I ALWAYS have my firewall enabled.  I've never found that it interferes with anything.  I don't use the "hardcore" mode ("Block all incoming connections") unless I am in an environment I know or suspect is hostile.  I do however enable stealth mode, and at some point I will consider using MarcoPolo to switch me back and forth between "hardcore" mode and not, depending on whether I'm home (reg firewall only), or in a trusted location (reg firewall only), or out in the field (hardcore).Exactly. I went through the same process myself, lol. Let me guess, you just switched from Windows to Mac, huh? The native, simple solution is to quit and reopen last session from History menu. The thing that irks me is there is no keyboard shortcut fro this, lol. This is one of the fundamental principles of Mac OS X which starkly contrasts to Windows. The window is really a "document". Closing all windows does NOT "quit" the app. However a handful of random apps WILL quit after closing the last window. Fortunately it's usually just the apps where it makes sense to do so.Should be a wiki, I'm going to upvote it though because I'd like to see more suggestions.JiTouch, exactly.By the way, Readabilty has just been dramatically improved - http://blog.readability.com/2011/01/the-new-readability/I'm confused, how did you add the screenshot for Bill? I mean is this his screenshot or yours?Seriously, it's a matter of RAM. Get more RAM and you will see dramatic improvements concerning responsiveness when many tabs are open simultaneously. You need at least 4GB. I had 2GB and was frustrated like you and upped to 8GB and it's like night and day. Looking at Activity Monitor, I was ALWAYS using all 2GB and now that I have 8GB, I find that I'm usually using 3-5GB. So I recommend 4GB or, if you can afford it, 8GB. Anything more is overkill though. Got 8GB from Amazon for $130, by the way.It was actually the 'Access Control' tab I was interested in seeing and in particular, Bills settings.  Thanks anyway thoWindows does not permit installing on a flash drive or external device of any kind. It can only be installed on internal HDDs. Of course you can have the virtual machine files anywhere, including USB devices.With only 64GB of HDD space, I would advocate to not install Windows. You wouldn't even have space to properly use Windows in about 10GB (most installs start at about 18GB, maybe it can squeeze down, I am not sure). For instance, downloading and installing updates would require additional space, not to mention the applications you wish to run on the Windows side.I would say use prebuilt tools people have created, used, tested, etc. That ensures you don't mess something up when modifying your operating system.I updated it for you.I'd actually forgotten that I posted this question, thanks for reminding me!  (Good thing SE has that unified inbox now.)  I was originally looking for any approach to take, be it in the application's interface or through scripting.  Turns out SO helped me out with the scripting a lot:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4708418/applescript-syntax-for-iphoto-automationCould you bind a keyboard shortcut for switching the keyboard? If so, I would recommend using KeyRemap4MacBook and PCKeyboardHack to bind caps lock to that keyboard shortcut. These utilities are vey impressive, and I was able to create a very complex keyboard layout using them along with ukelele.I have had the same problem with a new Macbook Air.Imac just wont connect to screen share. Tried your method but no joy. Grateful for any alternate suggestions, Steve@Steve - if you have a problem, you're better off opening a new question and asking about it there.Is this a problem when you play the DVD on your computer? You can do this through the DVD Player app in your Applications folder.@Ryan I don't want to install Windows, but unfortunately that's not an option. I need to be able to use some things for an EE class that only run on Windows.I didn't try that. See update in a sec.Great workaround! I've been wanting to use Google a bit at work. Seems like a very reasonable solution given the alternative.No worries Philip. Hopefully, this question might spurn others to find an answer or encourage the engineers at Apple to implement it. I the meantime, please don't take offense to me not having marked this as an answer. I'm optimistic that we'll soon find this available via some special setting or key combo. In a very internationalized technology world it would seem only appropriate that this feature exists--even if it is insufficiently documented at the moment. Thank you so much for taking the time to look into this.I am pretty sure he means it "pops up" behind your active windows. He wants it to pop up in front of his active windows.Yep, still getting the swing of the Mac. Using Command+Q seems to work with tabbed browsers as well as text editors.@SeniorShizzle Its more of a space concern than a principle concern. One option if you have a copy of Windows XP lying around is to install that to a USB drive: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/solutionbase-boot-windows-xp-from-a-usb-flash-drive/5928902. I haven't read anything about doing the same with Vista or 7 yet.I've noticed you wanna give it a second or two first though. You'll know it's paused when it changes from loading to paused.This will automatically begin to download the app, just like in iOS. So you will need to go to the downloads tab on the left and pause it as well if you go this route.However, this will not have the benefit of saving you from using data on a limited data plan.thank you very much! I want to say, You're a great moderator. Now I understand the situation.That's exactly what I mean Ryan.Often I'm opening it from the browser, but I think even from the Finder it opens behind the active window...Go with 8 GB, particularly if you are doing Dev Work. The additional headroom comes in handy when you have lots of stuff open.There is no way in hell that solar panel is good for 150 watts. If you look at the specs, it's rated as **7 watts**. Where are you getting the "~7 amps @ <22V DC on a regular day."Why not moving this to SO as the fact that it's on a Mac has a low incidence on the question I think. Moreover, I think you will have more answers over there.@ Griffo - Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I got the boot sound first. I tried to verify the disk previously from the OSX CD(last time this happened), and I could not verify permisssions. However, thanks to drfrogsplat, I've got a bit further this time - if you are interested, read on...@zevlag - Okay, email sent.  Let's see if I get a response _(I'm doubting it, but I hope you prove me wrong.)_@ drfrogsplat - Thanks for that. Now I can boot into OSX again! I didn't know about starting in verbose mode until now. Could not fix some problems. I verified disk and permissions with disk utility from OSX, which reported that my disk needs to be repaired, and also reported permissions problems with airport utility, and i-Life media browser. Not sure what wether that sheds any light on what causes the problem - I made some notes of what the computer was reporting in verbose mode too, if you are interested(I fully understand if you aren't!). Thanks again for the tip :)Do you mean to save space on your iOS device or your iTunes computer?Thanks a lot, this works for me, too. It's not exactly what I tried; I was attempting to replace the original image by its 1000 px version, and hence used the "duplicate finder items" where you use "copy finder items". Also, I used a second call to "scale" instead of "create thumbnail" as 128 px seem a bit small to me. Anyway, your approach has its advantages too, and I'll just accept it as an answer. If, some time later, someone finds this thread: I suppose handling duplicates is best left to scripts.Exactly what I was looking for, and confirmed also working on OS X 10.5.8I also had some issues with the annotations portability, but not only with skim. For example, annotations created by Preview can't be viewed by okular on linux.Actually, I think the question is more relevant for SuperUser.Related: http://superuser.com/questions/2127/what-zsh-features-do-you-useHad not thought of that. Will give it a try. Genius bar ran the mac through many tests and the good news is that it passed just fine. The bad news is that it continues...Fair enough, will post to SuperUser.Which (exact) model of iMac do you have? What version of OS X is installed?I'm sure installation is OK. A system from the same disk works fine on another machine+1 Too. Using it currently on a mixed Linux, Windows, Mac network and it works like a charm.Are all Software Updates installed? It may be a driver issue that was resolved via update.Check out Skim and I love it. Thanks!yeah I guess you're right ;) They're must be a typo on the product because while their website says 7 Watts, the back of my product has "~7 Amps" written on it... I probably should have noticed this when I first read 7 amps. That's enough electricity to send someone's heart into fibrillation.That's a little better. Still, I wish there were a way to achieve this as I can do with, say, Pidgin on Windows. Thanks for the tips :PThanks for the reply. I think calling myself an Electrical Engineer would be a bit of a stretch (as you can probably tell by now ;). On the other hand, Goal0 makes a 13.5W pannel (and many larger than that). I imagine you could use this to charge a more substantial battery (like a Hypermac or a Sherpa), which you could in turn use to charge the macbook. Some day I'm going to figure out a way to charge my Macbook Air dammit!And I still respect my Solar Panel...sorry about that accidental close; I misclicked when testing something@JM4 the point is, since this will come in the next release nobody will bother developing such thing. And no, no solution exists to this date to do that - also because nobody had enough reasons to do it.When you say wifi becomes unstable do you mean for all devices connected to it or just for the iMac itself?  Also, when you say unstable what do you mean?  Does signal drop out on WiFi?  Does signal remain good but you can't get to websites?  You need to be more specific.@Calavera `inquestion:this` search is **case sensitive**. for example try this, `inquestion:this iterm`, you won't get any results, but if you try `inquestion:this iTerm` you will find one entry.

If so, I'm out of ideas!Thanks @Mike for the update on Leopard, I'll amend the answer to reflect that.Thanks dude. Just bought GiO, it's insanely great, perfect for my needs. A little bit overpriced though.Do you use the any TVOut app? (ie. mirroring to VGA)As I understand you ask 2 different question, you can't permanently turn off your screen and let your macbook download your file during night?What type of file is it?

Thanks everybody.Nope, nothing unusual in there.OK, can you elaborate on the effect you see.  Does everything stop?  So if you're typing, do the letters stop printing as if you're not hitting the keys and then catch up?  Does the mouse pointer freeze in place?Yes the letters stop printing and then catch up about 1.5 seconds later. The youtube video stops (but the audio keeps playing) and then, 1.5 seconds later, jumps to the frame it's supposed to be on and continues smoothly from there. The mouse cursor does not freeze, but if I click during that 1.5 seconds I can get it to very briefly show the spinning color pinwheel thing. Also Activity Monitor was smooth, so maybe it is just limited to firefox or flash.Another option to consider that is not as expensive as a full SSD drive is the "hybrid" Seagate Momentus XT series, which couples a big SSD cache (4GB) with conventional hard disk storage. See http://www.anandtech.com/show/3734/seagates-momentus-xt-review-finally-a-good-hybrid-hddYou could try a reinstall of Firefox.  Have you got any addons/extensions installed?  Sometimes they can be buggy and chew up memory on you which can have weird results.  I'd suggest removing all extensions/addons via firefox prefs and then deleting it, emptying the trash and reinstalling a fresh copy and see how that goesI'd also try using Chrome/Safari and YouTube.  If you don't get problems with them when FireFox is closed at least you've isolated the problem to Firefox rather than Flash."to my Linux computer (my av receiver is connected to that)?" the key is my receiver.Nice, bit no linux command line client. Thanks.Drag and drop is also supported in this area if you like. Just drag from Finder into System Preference's "Login Items" once you're there.Nice, but not too easy to set up.Probably your best bet is to buy another power adapter, cut the cable, and connect directly to the MBA's power connections. Using the airline adapter means you're going: PV Panel -> DC-DC converter to 12v -> DC-DC Converter to 14.5v MBA PS Voltage -> DC-DC converter in MBA to charge batteries. You want to go PV Panel -> DC-DC Converter to 14.5v MBA PS Voltage -> MBA.Basically, inductor based DC-DC converters (everything > ~3W) have efficiency of ~75-90%, so 2 DC-DC converters is 81-56%. Basically, you want to minimize the number of conversions.I wouldn't classify TotalFinder a "replacement", but PathFinder sure seems like a replacement and consequently comes with a slight learning curve. TotalFinder is simple in that it only adds one real big feature; tabs. A recent update has also added cut & paste. The other features are relatively minor and most folks won't touch them.Clever little trick +1The easy setup isn't free. The free setup isn't easy.

What I want is to put the displays to sleep and that they stay off, which doesn't happen.Great, tried it and worked. I hope it keeps working. Thanks!Yup! Sweet and fresh ;)interesting, thanks! but as you say yourself it doesn't really help me with my actual problem which are DMGs downloaded off the Internet... if I do all this it'd be far easier to open the DMG and then Cmd-Tab it to the front...Firefox for iOS?I try to edit it, or change its properties/permissions in the Finder, and it doesn't let me. In addition, "You can only read" in Finder's Info is a hint as well.The file was indeed locked. Could you please expand on how to identify the uchg flag in the ls output?Thanks, it's more once a day, so I'll try the ping when it happens again. You're probably right about the red herring, as not only did I get the Apple TV at the same time (although it has happened with this switched off) I Time Capsule update was actually a week before I got the iMac...dont know if its just me, but the iPod touch 2g didnt sound as good as a classic ipod either+1 For Automator, its there just for situations like this!One thing nicer in Alfred than LB is you don't have to type real fast because LB starts over if you pause too long between letters and the pause feels too short. I also prefer the center stage view on Alfred as opposed to the LB menu tucked away at the top.If you're using Windows, MediaMonkey is a serious alternative to iTunes to manage your musicYes, I used `ln -s` from the commmand line. I tried using an alias aswell, but that didn't work either. Selecting "All applications" doesn't help, as I can already select Emacs.app, I just can't click 'Add'. I guess I could navigate to the "real" Emacs.app bundle, but the thing is that the version number is part of the path, so it would change when emacs is updated...Well you can do it in about 2 click from the home page, when locked, double tap the home button, then click on Pause. Another harsh way is to just pull out the headphones which cause an automatic pause.@oyvindio added a new idea@JM4 just prove me wrong and bring a solution then.Apparently that state is called "Activation Mode"@Handy In LB you can customize the "delay" until LB considers that you want to start over from 0.5 to 3.0 seconds. But it's true that you cannot "disable" it. The LB menu is not tucked away at the top: "You can move the LaunchBar window to your preferred screen location by dragging it to the desired location. Just make sure to click into an empty area of the bar when you start the drag. Alternatively, when you hold down the Command key, you can start dragging from anywhere else within in the bar. Note that you can also move the bar across multiple screens."Tks iPacheco, I already tried the GrapgicMac method but I wasn't satisfied with the results. The process is too long. I will pay attention to Apple's developer site. ThanksI already suggested that. But it won't work anymore when emacs is update (the version is in the path)Never configured anything on VLC, it works for me out of the box, with flv, wmv, mkv, mp4, avi, mov, mpeg. Unexpected crashes do happen, you have to deal with it, but other than that, it's great.@JM4: maybe try being a little less confrontational with people who are actually trying to help you out?Do you get the same thing on an external monitor?Any news on this one?Interesting point, to get the system to re-generate on re-boot.  I found 'some' display setting values on in a com.apple.preference.displays2.XXXXXXXX plist file in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost. NB: I do have 2 monitors, hence the "display2"?@petert Now that I checked on my Mac, I updated the post with the correct information.Does it actually work if you navigate to the real path of emacs?  Are you sure it's only the symlink/alias that doesn't work?This is what I thought; thank you for confirming this.Thank you so much for that! I was extremely curious as to what was going on and I have been looking for a cause/solution for awhile now.Yes. After 12 more hours of cogitation, it now displays images normally.It seems like it is: http://pastie.org/pastes/1529411 (the target of the link, at least), along with some other Emacs.app bundles I have deleted at some point. What does this mean?Apple store was no help. They tried to sell me a new iPhone 2G for $200. I used Pwnage Tool 3.1.5 and managed to revive the mobile service to my phone!you mean, it's not essential to uninstall NTFS-3G driver?Something tells me that this feature doesn't exist, and that's sad. If I'm particularly motivated enough, I may write this up at rdar://. I'm going to accept the only answer I got, because it, well, actually tried to solve the issue! :).See the comment on the original post, thanks for your answer.Thanks for coming back this question with the additional links you provided.Don't suppose you'd know of anything that works in the sidebar? Or perhaps a bottom bar? (Like the album art bar, but full width of iTunes, or at LEAST the full width of the library pane.)You could look through the software on the apple website here http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/ipod_itunes/ but I don't think you can get plugins for iTunes on the Mac which would show anything in the actual iTunes window.The answer to this lies in rcd.app (Remote Control Daemon)... There are some good details in http://forums.macgeneration.com/mac-os-x/patch-pour-les-touches-play-pause-sous-snow-leopard-300962.html , I can't believe the media keys just shell out Applescript. That's crazy!I've had serious issues doing this with Aperture which is why I'm hesitant on iTunes..I have my library and music on an external drive which works fine between computers (only tested on Mac OS X).There is a ton of additional help for you over at http://programmers.stackexchange.com/A portable Mac gives you the ability to debug location-based problems, for example "are we there yet?" apps.The only thing against this advice is that you can't take your dev environment on the road for debugging, etc.I had high hopes here at first, but this tool can't "install" an app from a backup (it will only overwrite the data). This app is basically doing the exact same thing I'm already doing with tar.Doesn't support 4.2.1. There is no way to do it without the 4.2b3 shsh blobs yet. It's speculated that greenpois0n RC5 will be able to on Feb 10th.Try restoring defaults in SysPref>keyboard shortcuts tab.Your question is a little confusing. Are you intending to take preventative measures in the event of theft? BTW, the accuracy on iPhone 4 is better than 3GS. Which one do you have?@Mims Glad you fixed the problem. @Griffo thanks ;)Sorry to hear that my suggestion really really didn't help! I typed the wrong folder name... I guess you have to either restore those files or do a little reinstall. Real sorry that happened, my fault big time.You should take a look at [How can I restrict Mac sharing services to a specific network/adapter?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/960/how-can-i-restrict-mac-sharing-services-to-a-specific-network-adapter) (which this is probably a dupe of).Could you tell me the correct folder, if that could help? I'll try working remotely. :)can you login using single-user mode?  hold command-s on startup.But I want it to use the lyrics I have.@calavera: Yes, I can login using single-user mode. Could I reset the password from there? Thanks!I meant not to include the `/System/Library/Keyboard Layouts` one (considered it, decided against it ,and forgot to remove it from the post). One to try could be `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardviewer.plist`, but that probably won't influence how the physical keyboard works.I've switched between the three browsers several times and Firefox seems to be the best of the three. Firefox 3 not so much, but Firefox 4 beta 10 is the best of the three, and unfortunately Safari is second; Chrome is awesome in Windows and especially Linux but not Mac, in my experience anyway...sorry, i suspect the key combi is only for 10.6.@Jon: I don't know how to reset the password via command line, but if there's a way to do it via command line you should be able to do it via single-user mode.

Maybe check `man passwd`?@Jon: actually, check out this question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34/how-do-i-recover-the-administrator-or-root-password-on-os-x@Dori I think that's a different question -- that question was about restricting incoming connections, this is about routing outgoing connections.haha, this is the exact response I was trying to avoid by adding the disclaimer that I do NOT want to sleep or turn on screen saver. The answer, if it exists, will most likely not be accessible through the system preferences GUI. IT's EVEN IN THE TITLE. :(I'm aware of this and this is the method I currently employ. Thanks still the same, since your solution largely fulfilled my requirements.

This could be a hardware problem; I'll have to check with the Apple Store.My MBA is not under warranty, but the keyboard problem coincided with the replacement of a defective screen panel. I wonder how the new panel could have affected the keyboard and mic.@Gordon - If I thought it was an exact dupe, I would have just merged them.There was news back in December that some AppleTV owners were having issues getting content from the iTunes store. Apparently, these were power users that switched OpenDNS or Google DNS, and that wasn't playing well with the way that Akamai (who does iTMS caching) handles downloads. I was having problems with Netflix on the ATV, so tried switching my DNS back to those of my ISPs. And it fixed the issue. So it may work for the iPad app as well.Well that's your preference but not really to do with the problem. I wasn't suggesting you switch permanently but the fact you're using beta software should give a hint at the potential causeThanks for the tips. But it has never worked before, or rather this was the first time *ever* that I had tried the bluetooth on my iPhone.That's an excellent suggestion. It does indeed work when logged in as Guest.

Or did you run them afterwards?Yeah the Dual Head 2 Go is the one I linked to on my answer, they are great bits of kitI think this plugins didn't work in snow-leopard at least didn't work for me :(Thx :-) Let us know when you got something working.To be specific, Mac OS X does on-the-fly defragmentation **of file under 20 megabytes**. If you're doing stuff with large files (i.e. video editing), you could end up with fragmentation issues.That did the trick.  Thank you!I was able to edit the question and add the screenshot.It would have to be a pair that also have that little button and I will not buy an extra pair just for trying that. The result would have been that those would exhibit the same problem though, see my solution.I had the exact same problem for about six months. Paperclip is the answerLooks just like what I wanted!Beautiful!  Haha, it's funny but that's not very intuitive.  Glad that sorted it.Works in Snow Leopard for me...Are you talking about in Terminal or Finder?@Griffo in Finder..At least give the option to change it dear Apple! Of course people are not asking any more why my 200GB has only 186GB.. but stil..@Lipis I agree! Then again, Apple isn't famous for user-configurable options. When I need that, I switch to my Linux VM.no change when i did that.I ran them during.OK, so then there was no slowdown on your WiFi.  In that case it points the finger back at your Mac if that's what you were using when you saw a slowdown.  It takes the network out of it to be honest because you can be pretty sure that with no increase in response time, there's no problem with your WiFi.Hey, great advice.  I wish it had syntax highlighting for *.html.erb files, but at least I can read them now.  Cool!This is the "proper" conversion. K stands for Kilo, which means 1000, not 1024.@phihag actually you're right.. :DBinary GB values are called GiB (gigibytes).Actually it's gibibyte but thanks for making me realise I'd put GB instead of GiB.  Corrected now.Looks like there is nothing we can do unless some third party apps that promising this... but I'm not really willing to even try them..! Both answers are right.. but there can be only one :DWell Apple did get the nice side effect of making everybody think that Snow Leopard suddenly saved them a few GiBs over Leopard!  Unless you're working to very particular file size constraints for some reason it's not that big a deal.  On the upside it makes a 500GB disk a 500GB disk instead of a 466GiB diskNo.  It is slow, and insensitive, but not laggy.If it's at all possible, take your mouse and computer to the nearest [Genius Bar](http://www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar/). They can help you test both your computer and the mouse to figure out the culprit, and get the issue resolved.  It's most likely not something you can resolve yourself.  As a temporary workaround turning off WiFi may work, as WiFi and Bluetooth use the same frequency ranges.Correction, I think that boot disk is read-only so you may not wipe it but it's still important to get `if` and `of` in the right order in caseI don't understand the applicability of a vlan interface in this case... but I'll take a gander. Yes, it is a dual-antenna wireless-N model.We appreciate your opinion, but the condescending vitrol really doesn't help. I had this problem in my second of four apple laptop's I've ever had, and there was other notable stress damage on the laptop (bulging case, etc.). Despite my laptop being well out of warranty, the Genius replaced mine free of charge. Problems happen, things go wrong, the company that gives everything away goes out of business. The unfortunate thing is, you quite possibly have the "correct" answer in this question, I admit.Yeah, it doesn't make sense, particularly, unless Apple intends on building in the ability to change that.  It also could be that whatever OS is running on these devices requires interfaces to be part of a vlan to do routing properly.  *shrug*Great tip, thank you!Thanks a lot. I completely overlooked the definitons with the hex-values when looking at the file. Thanks again for the hint about the argument :-)no joy with that, sadly.Yes, thank you. It does help a little, but I would like to have more :) The whole idea of this spotlight search is to get results instantly. Otherwise one can open a finder search window or the Dictionary app...Why is this being voted up? If the answer as stated were really that simple, then nothing would run in the simulator, even apps that are being tested by a developer. The Simulator emulates a physical iPhone as much as possible, but there are a variety of limitations.@philip true, but yours ain't much better as an answer to this question. IMHO the best answer would be "yes, here's the hack" and the second best would be "no, there's no hack to do it yet" from someone who have actually looked hard for it.@Cawas: Fair enough. I have updated my answer to include information related to actual goal of the OP.I did exactly the same thing, but only later in the game. 2 gig and 120gb were quite enough for developing. Problem was also using it as my only personal computer.@HandyRandy to me it's pretty clear he's looking for preventative measures on any event of loss, with an iPhone 4 (not that this matters much). And I think the answer for a good software will have to include jailbreaking because it's the only way to have access to all phone resources like *Find my iPhone* has.I always considered iPhone Simulator to just (intended to ) be a more practical and faster way than using a physical iPhone. But thinking of your way the question would be even more valid - Suppose we don't have an iPhone. How would we go on and use the Simulator to run the app?@Cawas: I have updated my answer to include that scenario as well. But, to be clear, the iPhone Simulator is designed for the singular purpose for a developer to conveniently test an application they are building. It does one thing and one thing only.that's where a hack would come in! unlikely to become as legal as jailbreaking an iphone, but still I doubt it would be as illegal as pirating or stealing.@Cawas: If there is a hack, I don't know one, so I didn't include it in my answer. Even if I did, I wouldn't include it because I don't agree with hacking or jailbreaking being a software developer myself. Never make assumptions about the App Store software license for users or developers. It is very comprehensive.The /etc/rc solution worked before Leopard, but will not work in modern versions of OSX (Leopard & Snow Leopard). Now, the proper way to do things is using launchdaemons as shown here.you can use iStumbler (http://www.istumbler.net/) Please read this answer, it helped me. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4044/macbook-pro-constantly-losing-wifi-connection-with-wrt150n-router/4126#4126heh , lol i know i can do that ... but thats only with the camera roll photos ... what about my other photo albums ? where is the trash icon ? :) there isnt any ... thats the question i asked ...is there any tweak that I can use to be able to delete ANY photos. basically photos that i have sync. with itunes in my iphone .... thanksI don't think any of the answers in that duplicate are sufficient. The keyboard shortcut linked to is the most complicated "short cut" I've ever seen. One shortcut to activate (place in focus) the keychain in the menubar. On a laptop that would be FN+control+F8, then another to activate the lock screen option. Perhaps if you would have left this open someone could have provided a better shortcut solution.If you use a single finger, and spam your way across the trackpad, does your cursor move at all?Of course. It works like normal.Nice, thanks. Where can I get the full list of such keyboard shortcuts?Plus, 5 hours of Facebook is enough to kill a strong man.Problem with them is that they only output certain content and have to be supported by the Application. I'm looking for something that mirrors everything, like what Steve Jobs uses at his Keynotes (although I guess that's Apple Internal)@Michael If you're playing a movie or a presentation, these should be fine. I haven't seen these used with Safari, so good point there. I would look into some kind of a VNC client that lets you view your iOS device on your Mac, and connect the Mac to the TV/projector. Never seen this kind of software, but it might exist.That would make sense except that I've never used it in that way, meaning as a USB device.  Anything that's on there I've put there via iTunes.Thanks for the tip, and the linked article was helpful. Who knows we may get a two windowed finder, snap to screen sides ala Windows 7, and some more customization options in OSX Lion! (Or maybe not...)Are you sure you copied these into your User account's folders (/Users/yourusername/Library), rather than the system? (/System/Library or /Library,)  also, it might be a permissions problem, though that's less likely if you did in fact *copy* these folders.I believe it might be dynamic. Meaning if you only have a small amount of some type of data it is grouped into other.I wish Photo.app WOULD have a rotate button! So you're saying that you're not jailbroken and it also happens to you?What OS version are you running? Have you checked for runaway backgrounded apps?Actually, recently, Apple's been pretty good with their battery claims. Various recent products I've bought and tested have met or beaten the published expectations, even with "real" normal use.Any ideas how to get an eject button, if you ahve a non-mac keyboard?I know mileage varies with use... I'll agree that the iPad does very well.  The iPhone 4 is better than expected, but not what they claim (but hey, I'm a heavy user).  Neither my MBP or my wife's MBA (all she does is surf) get anywhere near their claims.  The MBA does do very well though.Yes, I copied them into my User account's folders.  And yes, it was copy and paste using Finder.[It](http://twitter.com/rgriff/status/34131656608587776) [seems](http://twitter.com/rgriff/status/34252961991364608) that he just made the computer run at 100% CPU power in order to use up all of the battery; not necessarily to test the battery life. Thanks for the suggestion though.I've never had any issues with the iPhone 4, iPad, or even iPhone 3G's battery life; it's just this MBA that seems to be way off the mark of "7 hours".Are they in the same folder in your iTunes library? If you right click, go to 'show in finder' - are they in the same folder?Will using something such as BOINC guarantee that the computer usage will remain the same every time I run the benchmark? (e.g. ideally it should be performing the exact same calculations every time I run it).i tried this. it said it had some permissions to repair, so i repaired them, rebooted and... no change. oh well.It does work fine :)Thanks, that is what I want.There are no such items in iTunes' menu.I think F12 will work as an eject button if you hold it for about 2 seconds but I don't know if it will work with these keyboard shortcuts.I just tried a little experiment. I created a new user account, and copied (with ditto) the original ~/Library/Preferences to the new account Library/Preferences. Then I logged in to the new account. Command keys still work in the new account. So I think that eliminates ~/Library/Preferences as a candidate.Haha, yeah unlikely.  Apple wouldn't want to be accused of following in Microsofts footsteps now would they?@piobyz It's not the menu in iTunes. It's the global settings on your Mac.Another experiment: I logged out and used another account to move ~/Library to ~/Library.old. I logged back in again and the problem still occurred. So I don't think the problem is with anything in ~/Library. Where else does Mac OS keep per-user data?Thanks @JBRWilkinson !

I think the SMS solution is practical, but It must include some type of authentication.

For now I think I'll just leave the 3G on, but too bad I hasn't got the precision of the Wifi-tracking. I wonder why it doesn't use the GPS which works just fine.Thanks for sharing. For now I don't consider jail-breaking it and I'll stay with the 3G solution, unless I start to have low bat all the time.@HandyRandy sorry if the question was confusing. I just want to be able to know where my iPhone is in the incident I forget it somewhere or in the event of a theft.

The thing is. I just didn't want my 3G or Wifi to be on all the time, even if I am not transmiting data all the time, they tend to drain the battery.

@Cawas
I guess if I want to be able to use the SMS feature I would have to either Jailbreak my iPhone or wait for Apple to implement something like, which my not happen.I've just gone and quit everything to make sure. Running latest public version - not a beta.This does not work here, as there are no menu items in iTunes to select sources that then could be triggered from "System Preferences">"Keybaord">"Keyboard Shortcuts"Also, for non jailbroken iphones -- Podcaster works great.  No file size restriction on 3g.As @IntuitionHQ said, it may be a hardware issue and apple care would replace your mbp for you. Tried calling the support?Yes that is exactly what I am saying...weird. tho I'm on mac, ical and google calendar have the exact same colors and nobody picked them. but, unlike the answer on the other question suggests, on my iphone the colors are all different! I have never even noticed this before.@Senseful It won't do the same calculations, but it will use everything your computer's got (100% CPU, etc), so the load should be the same.For additional information on IPSec, use the built-in "syslog" command to query all logs for messages from the racoon key management daemon:


    syslog -k Facility -k Sender racoonI do more actual work in iA Writer than I do in Pages (not that that's saying much).I use it for serious work with my iMac. Maybe it helps that I have a 5 GHz 802.11n wifi network, but it's honestly nearly as fast as a cable-connected monitor.@IntuitionHQ: Yes.@Iorin: what is your question? whether it can be done?You can use `<kbd>` to format keys. I've also added some HTML comments, because there's an unknown character in the last three (at least under Win7).@calavera: Looking for the Applescript code. I clarified the question.Thanks for the <kbd> tip :) I removed html comments, while it looks fine on my mac.What do you mean by "size" number of kilobytes? unread messages? total messages?I don't know where you found the Command+Shift+I to Inspect Element.  In Chrome, if you go to File, right above Print you see Command+Shift+I is Email Page Location.Depending on you keyboard and key bindings, you might need to press `Ctrl` + `function (fn)` + `F2`You're right. Somehow I got this confused with Command + Shift + C as zevlag pointed out below. Thanks.My confusion. See comment above, thanks for the help.What? You don't like seeing 100 unplayed podcasts? I know the feeling. I just learned to ignore it.drutil just hangs. What is the volume name if there is no CD in the drive?Yes, fsck -fy. I don't have the system disk right here, that's the next thing to try. But supposedly fsck should do the same as Disk Utility.See edit for disk permissions commandIs your 3G or Wi-Fi on? I've noticed on mine that the Wi-Fi antenna can look for signal if there isn't any and run down the battery that way.it is not that reason, I mean even when it goes into standby the battery still drains like crazyThanks, very elaborate. Didn't know about the IMEI. Also I didn't think about the battery, meaning that a rescue operation needs to be started quickly...You said it never goes into standby.  Standby is when the screen is off.  How long do you get from a full charge?  Are you in an area of bad coverage?What do you mean exactly with "no CD in the drive"? Do you have no physical medium in your drive or does it just not show up in your computer?
Anyway you can run "diskutil -list" to get the identifiers for Volumes and use them instead of /Volumes/mountpoint; disk0 usually indicates your main drive, so the above command would change to eg. hdiutil detach -force disk2 if disk2 turns out to be the Identifier for an empty CD/DVDIt looks like ShiftIt is the only free option available. Anyone have experience with it?Yes, sorry my bad for the poorly explaination. The problem is when I have fully charged my iphone, and I leave it be when I go to sleep. The day after the battery is down to 80%. I mean it can barely go on for a full day, (and I barely use it). When I go to `General > Usage` I see that the Usage time is equally to the Standby time. That's what I meant by it never goes into standby.Good one! I wish this shortcut also worked in finder windows.But this just became a recent problem. The signal bar shows full signal power.What sort of email accounts do you have? POP? IMAP? Exchange? Gmail? Are you syncing your phone with a Mac or a Windows PC? What (if any) mail program do you use? Apple Mail? Outlook? Thunderbird? Entourage?Doesn't 3G use more battery than Wi-Fi?@zevlag: total number of message. I've updated the question.Wow. I was just going to suggest something like `ls /Path/To/MailBox/*.emlx | wc -l` for messages in a box, but yours is definitely the better answer. Thanks!I already done all those things. And I have owned a smartphone quite some time now (2 years). The thing is that it normally last for couple of days with just having it on the standby. However now recently it can't even last for one full day. Even though if I leave it in standby.Well if there are no applications running, the screen is black, you're not using it much and the battery is still, despite all of this, not capable of lasting a day, then I think it may need repair and we can't do much for you here.  You could try bringing it back to Apple, that's probably your best bet.You should realize that if the OS (OS X) can't eject your DVD tray, the OS (Darwin) will likely be unable to eject your DVD tray. When you get down to it, both are running the same code to communicate with the drive hardware. This question is still useful for remote administrators, but in your case I think you have a hardware issue on your hands. At least it's pretty easy to replace a Mac Pro optical drive.Sorry, yes I meant on my mac. Running OSX (updated snow leopard). How would I go about turning IPv4 off?If you can stand the heat, you might not need big AC for the entire room.  Just pipe cold air to the Mac Pro fan inlets from a small AC in another room.  You only have to keep the fan inlet area below 35C.Can't launch diskutil in single-user mode, bould I could repair the disk booting with the system disk. Although it got corrupted again some minutes later. Third HD for this MBP.Third HDD? Yikes, well I'd recommend you get an SSD.  Do you carry it around a lot?  The biggest thing to be mindful of is moving it when you close the lid.  You shouldn't move it until the status light has gone from on to a slow pulseI like this idea. I'm loathed to pay 20$ for a stylus for a device that's designed expressly not to require one.Just for my own curiosity, why do you want to do this?same problem here (2 dif. accounts on traveler)... got it to work but don't know how... works on my iphone but cannot recreate it on another iphone...really just looking to see what happens. wondering if my ISP is up and running v6 yet, and really just how prepared things are for someone willing to use the new protocol. No real reason other then my own curiosity.Can you browse \\tsclient ?@Harv: yes, it shows me a single folder, `\\tsclient\Downlo1`, which when I try to access, gives the same error message.I've lived in hotter temperatures and used computers even without an AC running. Even if temperatures rise to 51 degrees, it will never get that hot indoors. If it did, you probably wouldn't survive for too long ;) In a well-ventilated lodging, you should be at a comfortable 30 degrees. A fan directed right into the air inlet should keep your system cool.That sounds like something you dislike about iTunes, not the iPod Touch.Not a programming question so I won't leave an "answer". That being said, use "Get Info" > "Artwork" > "Delete" to remove all the artwork, sometimes it doesn't get deleted in the "Clear Downloaded Artwork".this is not a hardware issue. in mac os everything works fine. it's a windows driver issue, but i hardly can find any drivers.Nice. nvALT does seem to do it. Would be interested in others.Genius :-) That's exactly what I was hoping to achieve.goodreader is an appDo you know any workaround for "Apps" item (special kind (none/Books/folder/Genius/iTunes U/Library/Movies/Music/Party Shuffle/Podcasts/Purchased Music/TV Shows, r/o) : special playlist kind)?How many bulk messages do you need to send? I normally just use the standard Messaging app.MaxiVista sells a version of their product that lets you use another *Windows* machine as a secondary display for a Windows machine. *That* is the thing that costs 40 bucks, but that is not what we are talking about--we are talking about using an *iPad* as a secondary display. The MaxiVista product that lets you use an iPad as a secondary display costs $9.99.@NR4TR that's the point. there is no driver. even the newest mbp still comes with USB 2.0. it's so basic and well established that both windows and mac comes with any driver needed built in. it's easier to have a mal function USB than "wrong drivers" for it. check out my edit.I have been tempted by Textmate before, but will have to add it to my too buy list :(OS X definitely can't read FreeBSD UFS file systems.@diago Kod (http://kodapp.com) is a (free) Textmate 2 wannabe, it's still in early stages but developing very fast. The Markdown plugin for it shouldn't take very long, you could wait for that.Besides, I don't know what you're using right now as a text editor, but textmate might be the killer tool that will make you forget about all others. And still serve as a fast note taker (throw in some Dropbox and you can even sync it wherever you are).Now I _really_ wish I had a small touchscreen for music controls!Unfortunately, no. And if i select Apps/Ringtones and try to get their name/id, nothing returns. :-(I think that Wikipedia list is pretty comprehensive; the [features table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_remote_desktop_software#Features) shows you exactly which products have audio support. The only problem is that table doesn't easily let you see which products are made for OS X.Are the non-playing songs DRM'd?@Loic I use MacVIM for Text Editing. The idea of Markdown just came about because I would like preview capability, but then I haven't looked at a VIM plugin for it.@diago shouldn't be hard, gruber provide the perl script to transform markdown to HTML. Then again, I don't know how to create a vim plugin, but it should be easy for _someone_ :)Start working at night! ;)The question text does not match the question title.This is what I do. I have a shared folder or two on my PC, and then I mount these folders on my Mac through the finder: command-K then mount "smb://WindowsComputer/SharedFolderName". This seemed much easier than trying to share the folder from my Mac and mounting it on the Windows machine.Are you plugging into power a power adapter first?No go for `chsh`; it still gave me `tcsh` as the default shell. However, `/bin/bash -l` does work. I'd like to hear other opinions before I accept it as the _right_ answer, thought.@Diago  I believe Scrivener will also do it, but it may be overkill for what you're trying to do.  For a simple, fast, universally accessible note-taking utility, NV and its spawn are hard to beat.Bless you, Scott Jackson. Be the change you want to see in the world. Thank you!Apple Care doesn't do data recovery but they may be able to recommend a place that can.*Always* opt to "keep email on server". Why wouldn't you?Why would you want private info kept on the server for years?  I want my email on my PC harddrive or iPhone only.... as soon as possible.   NOT on some server that I have no control over.For me, the solution to remove the add-in in Outlook does not work.It doesn't do full file system encryption on OS X sadly, which was the question :( Container encryption works fine, but in 2011 it's also kinda lame.Gus, thank you for taking the time to chime in. Acorn is awesome tool, and I just wanted to make sure I didn't overlook anything. I'm certainly looking forward to this feature being added in the future.Nope.  Just non-DRM'd MP3s.Thanks.  I'll try the network option this coming weekend.Wow. That's far more involved that I thought it'd be. Thanks for the links. I'm taking this one to the depot for repair.hey, I updated my question with the fix which solved my problem. All it needed was a factory reset. Anyway thanks for your tips.the SMART status for the drive was reported as fine. Can you see [this follow-on question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8000/imac-refuses-to-boot-disk-utility-always-says-there-are-drive-errors-it-cant-re)? It's still not booting after a restore and Disk Utility still says there are unrecoverable errors on the drive. Thanks!Thanks! I'm restoring from an older back up now.Take a look at [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) as well, even though it sounds you've solved the issue.No problem, glad you got sorted.I'm not sure why this was changed from "privacy" to "security".I've seen the number 60Hz floating around the net for the iPad, but can't find any super trustworthy sources the explicitly state this number. I'd say it's a safe bet though.I have a Mac Pro. I live in Madrid. So it shouldn't be a problem, but you'll want to have A/C around during the day.Those, unfortunately, require WiFi to operate - the 1st-gen touch didn't have Bluetooth.I've done it in both orders. I can't see any difference in the frequency of failure.So does jail breaking an iphone consist of changing file system and directory permissions or is it more complex?  If so, does anyone know the low level technical details?It's more complex than that, I'm sure the various dev teams that work on it have lots of info on their websites, and you should ask this as a fresh question, not post it as an answer to an existing question. However, if you ask that particular question, it's likely to get closed, so I answered it here for you. Welcome to Ask Different/Stack Exchange!Have you tried setting up an XP VM? iTunes runs fine on XP; your sticking point will be the USB support in your host OS and the virtualization environment.Listing every single feature will probably result in a list larger than StackOverflow's various book recommendations for programming language learning. As such, this question is excessive. What SPECIFIC features do you need?This works but it doesn't work in a loop or if you press run, then press it again it overwrites.So what's the standard then? Case-insensitive?Case-insensitive is standard, and is almost always the better option.@VxJasonxV: Well that's just it... right now there a certain set of features that I need, but in the future those requirements might change. I agree that listing every single one of them may be excessive, so maybe a comparison of the top 50 or so features in both applications would suffice.Sure, but that's true of any investment you make. What are the top 50 features in a word processor?No, not for this.  I figured I could potentially save a lot of time by asking if somebody else had done it first.updated to include loop.  If you set the 'Format' of the last step to include seconds it shouldn't overwrite.@CajunLuke: Thanks!CamTwist also supports playing movies via a playlist. Maybe you can finagle it to play a movie while it is still recording? Sounds hokey, but another thought is that if you can somehow play a movie that is being recorded, then you could have camtwist output the desktop with that video playing and publish that as a video source??? I dunno.Edited again, loop had to go at the endIf you're familiar with Microsoft Word, then buy Word. If you don't want to spend as much, get Pages. Feature-wise, they're pretty close (if not necessarily identical in how they do things). I have both but prefer Word for its compatibility.Did you give it a go?  Just curious+1 for Wikipedia comparisonscan I gift something to myself?I did. i couldn't reach anything at all. Looks like i didnt get an IP assigned. The information under the IPv6 area was all blank after I set it to auto.Is X11 running?@Matt Ball http://www.mimomonitors.com/It starts XQuartz automatically when i run the 'nautilus' command, is that the same thing?I get the same error - anyone know of a solution?Do you have any Rules set for dealing with your mail?

Are there ANY other folders in your Mail set that could be holding your incoming mail?yes that is roughly the same thing.Cool idea, but the company seems kind of price-gouging - e.x. they charge an extra $30 just for a Mac touchscreen driver.This is most likely the best way to do it. Easy, permanent, and doesn't conflict with anything else.limera1n.com WORKS!+1 just for including the black background! lolWhat versions of OS X and Safari are you running?This "hum" you speak of happens on my iPad and I've just gotten used to it. It's not noticeable when sounds are playing.sounds like a permissions error, not RDP. Are you on the same LAN? It looks like RDP is trying to access the target windows box using SMB, which is a whole ordeal in and of itself.Great. I didn't know about this. I'm coming from unix word where chsh is the way to go, but I would surely recommend using built-in Mac OS X tool instead.I use MyKeePass on iPhone, works also with dropbox. Make sure the number of times your database.kdb is encrypted is high enough.Greenpois0n method explained with screencast at http://lifehacker.com/#!5754463The iPhone lastpass is paid $1 month. MyKeePass is $1 once.@Anton They don't seem to be quite comparable feature-wise, and you can use the free Lastpass bookmarklet, which covers 99% of what I want to use it for.Wait... so why do you need _any_ administrator's username and password there?Perhaps, but 3G is not something most people would wanna turn off unless you're in a poor coverage area or aiming for maximum battery life.@Randolph: Make your comment an answer and I will vote it up.Office for Mac recently got a trial page: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/trial so he can try both for a month before buying.+1: I was looking for that and you beat me to the punch. I always found that article fascinating.Hmm. I wish the resources would be local, I don't want other users on the machine to have access to my VPN connection.They DO NOT have access to your VPN configuration (unless they use sudo), and DO NOT have access to your VPN unless they are logged in at the same time, but the possibility of exactly this happening (a standard user re-routing network-connections that could affect other users on the same system) is what requires admin privileges.Do you mean this character : ` ?Tried this and it didn't work.  Made sense though...Other songs play fine.  The only thing in common with songs that don't play is the 320 kbps bit rate.  These are all non-DRM'd MP3 files.  They all play fine on the host computer so, I know that they are pointed to the right place.@Pierre W yes, that's backtickI found it weird this answered your question @sugar. From my point of view, you asked the location of the photo library inside iPhone and this gives you the location on the synced desktop. Anyway, it is fine to copy it.How about just displaying a "popup" notification of the email received as a regular email on the iPhone?I only want a popup on a particular "From" address, which is the problem.You'd have to accelerate more than 1G, pretty impossible in most cars.Fair enough; better use a F1 car then :)TimeMachine would totally miss his target if it wouldn't be possible, don't you think ?thanks for the work!  I'll try copying those files/folders and see what happensThanks - unfortunately BTT doesn't activate until mouse-up; I'm looking for mouse-down. I'll clarify the question.Well, Reeder's interface is much nicer (and cleaner) than that of Google Reader. Also, Reeder supports offline reading.I too use this solution, although most of my data is in the cloud anyway. It is just a case of making sure that updates are applied to both. I used to use the laptop for everything (with monitor keyboard etc at my desk), as I was offsite more often than not, but that's changed now.Thanks! That's Cool! And do you know what the Japanese characters stand for? Does the way they are put on keys mean I can input them directly? How can I input these characters then?Look at that. Very cool. It's all there, safe and sound. Thanks!@Pierre W: Not really. Apple makes no claims the data is stored in a format that'll be accessible piecemeal from any other machine. Thankfully it is.Thanks for the link, it worked.Thanks - Zooom does move/resize but not raise/lower or maximizing. I did submit a feature request.I think that one of the main aspects of prototyping is to not allow any code in the application, including gestures. Therefore, it may be difficult to find such an application.You can always control click instead of right click, which is the traditional way to access context menus.This works because firefox has a profile manager. I don't believe this is anything inherent on osxI don't want to mount a disk with AS, I want to *run* an AS when a disk gets mounted. I'll edit my post to make it more clear.Oh, I checked and you can run multiple instances of iTerm.app, so you don't need profiles ( Although iterm has profiles, I haven't been able to choose profile from commandline ) but the rest of the process would remain the same. And OP would get a new Dock Icon that spawns a new terminal windowAgain, I don't want to mount an image or a disk with Applescript, I want to run a script when a disk gets mounted. I can't find a way to accomplish that with your steps.I understood the question, but I don't think it is possible to do this very easily. I did, however, tooled around a bit and found something that should work with a bit of tweaking to meet your needs.I tried doing this, but it gives the same error message.this is very close, and thank you for the answer. However, it doesn't *quite* give me what I need.  Automator can indeed launch new iTerm windows (and new Terminal instances too), but these windows/apps aren't running "inside" the Automator-generated application, so they don't get the app benefits I listed. Instead, the automator app spawns separate instances under the iTerm app name.wow - very cool. unfortunately when I double click it says "You can't open the application because the Classic environment is no longer supported." Say what??Yep, i see after clarification that it doesn't work because that's hard drive you're mounting (and not image disk).I tried a chmod a+x on it but it still gives me that error message.I made some small modifications to the script. Works fine :)The general recommendation is to *not* use raw disk access with VirtualBox. There are several reports of corrupted data, broken drivers (since VirtualBox installs its helper drivers), etc.@Antal S-Z thanks for this to knowYou will still have to go into the App itself and change some other things around as this will still be listed as Terminal in the menubar and the app title bar however in the cmd+tab it will show ProjectA & ProjectBcould you explain what the difference is in terms of functionality?these are emacs shortcuts more than they are bash i believeAre you sure you're changing the share name?  Access Network, and see that the share name is indeed foo.Just to clarify, you're talking about the password for the backup, which is different than the phone's lock code.@dstarh : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2991/whats-the-difference-between-alias-and-linkIt already does those things. For raising to front, check the settings. For maximizing, just double click while holding down your chosen modifier keys.It does. I use it. But be warned the gesture is not customizable for this particular feature and the gesture they have chosen is kind of hit or miss. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it. Hopefully this will be optimized once they get out of beta.Automator!  Why do I keep forgetting about that thing?Thanks for the link. I'm trying to install Windows by using the USB flash drive, but I ran into some problems: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8044 -- Could you please take a look at it to see if it's something you know how to resolve?

Thanks for the suggestion :-).Definitely concur with trying both out before committing. That will tell volumes more than just looking at feature comparison grids.I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 under OSX fine with VirtualBox. I don't have it set up so that you can boot direct to Ubuntu, but that might be possible.This fails at step 4, which doesn't let me access the Mac's contents with the error message I posted above.No problem.

DFU mode is just as I answered above. Recovery is: Hold home, press and hold power for 1-2 sec to start the device, release power -> iTunes cable (recovery). Try what I said above. I've tried it thousands of times and it works - here's a video on how to do DFU properly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl5mXtmBusEI didn't realize the dock keyboard was any different!

Unless you can hold the home key for some period of time. But still, I doubt it. Note also that you will have no way to select/swipe in the multitasking bar.Well, I'm glad you know how to search, because I completely forgot to put the actual link in there! Thanks ;).I'm afraid you're correct. For this particular contact, I have his default address for the distribution lists that he's in set to his work email address. However, whenever I email just him, I end up accidentally sending it to his home email address.Not entirely sure but I think that this method asks you to 'Buy' again but after clicking the 'Buy' button it will acknowledge that you have already purchased the app.@wajiw you can restart the Dock/Dashboard by `killall -HUP Dock` at a terminalnice, that works.  I had to re-add the widgets but they were there and had the same prefs.  thanksThe work email is first in the Address Book.Well, this is annoying, but it forced me to find time to upgrade that old iMac to Leopard. All is good now. Thanks!Then maybe make it last? Not the most logical solution, but the strangest things work sometimes.What I'm saying is, the 4 digit code is *not*, by default, the passcode used for the backup. Maybe she can try some of her common passwords when iTunes prompts. Also, @Asmus' answer is another way to try and find it, if the password was saved in the keychain.You can use `<kbd>` for keyboard shortcuts. ;)Thanks -- this is true, but I still think it's too easy to mix up which one you're in when you're trying to have quick conversations with multiple contacts. I wish you could customize each person's bubble color or background. It seems really silly that you can't.Thanks for the explanation - Hmm, I was afraid of that. I'm worried about going the jailbreak route, but maybe that's the only way I can get the features I want.That question you link to is actually mine. I ended up buying a Sony DRC-BT30, and it's pretty good. It would work the way you mention, however, I was hoping for a software only solution.Have you tried a different cable?@Griffo nope, I'll check that out.  possible that's the problemI've seen that happen before but it's never been my computer.  In my case, once it was a broken monitor, another time it was a dodgy cable.  There are different types of DVI cables so make sure you have the correct one for both MacBook and monitor.Go back to the Apple Store and ask them to activate the iPod for you.Glad I could help point you in the right direction. Prism is limiting and as of last week no longer under development I think. If you want a good SSB check out Fluid.app.It sounds like it's crashing when you close it (for whatever reason), and restarting because of the crash. You will probably have to fish through log files to see if that is the case.@senseful Oops! I hadn't noticed that was your question. Seems these Apple products are great but some types of usage just aren't catered for. Had iPod Touch plugged into stereo last week and couldn't find a way to control it from across the room.there are good reasons on both sides; my own opinion is that, given that less than 1% of this site's questions are on *any* "Remote Desktop", there's no real need to split them.He's in the OS, otherwise he couldn't have run Onyx.The reason I asked was because I'd have expected him to be able to run Disk Utility from within Snow Leopard rather than from the install CD.I don't think it'll run in WINE. Too many dependencies on device drivers I think.I do use Fluid a bunch and like it... but since it's based on Safari I don't get all of my Firefox extensions (in particular Firebug). If there was Fluid for Firefox I'd be set.Depend what you mean by work - the disk level stuff maybe but permissions noI didn't even think to run Disk Utility from within Snow Leopard, honestly. I assumed I wouldn't be able to operate on a mounted filesystem.All I needed to do was run the filesystem checks, not repair permissions, and it worked fine. (I didn't try verifying/repairing permissions at all, so I have no idea if that would have worked.)@Mark: true, but the permissions repair portion is best run from the live system anyway; I doubt Onyx would've recommended booting from DVD for a permissions repair.  BTW, I'm leery of using 10.5's filesystem repair on 10.6, because Apple added at least one feature filesystem-level compression) to 10.6 that 10.5 and its repair tool won't understand.Ah, yeah you can run it from within Snow Leopard but whether it can repair it will depend on what's wrong.  You can do a Repair Permissions on any disk, or a Repair Disk on any disk which is not your startup disk.  If you need to do a Repair Disk, you will need to do it from your CD and I think the 10.5 disk will be fine for the lower level stuff.  It's worth trying the Repair Permissions first from Snow Leopard though.  That solves a lot of issues.Which inputs/outputs are you using exactly? You say you've using DVI output from the MBP and DVI input on the display, but the question is tagged "displayport". I'm guessing that you're actually using the mini DisplayPort out on the MBP + a mini DisplayPort-DVI adapter/cable, right? Also, when you say "Detect Displays does nothing," does that mean that Displays Preferences doesn't show an attached external display?The filesystem compression (if I believe) uses a file system fork (like the data/resource forks), so 10.5 should support it as just another file fork.That's why it's after "get sixty million people to ask for iTunes on Linux" - it's less likely to happen.Oh, so it's a limitation set by the podcast provider. Thanks! (Btw, it's not the same on iTunes - I see more). That's why I thought it may have been a limitation that Apple put.You forgot "Install Windows in a VirtualBox VM, install iTunes, Activate iPod". It's probably easiest.Ok thanks! This is a detailed explanation. :)Hrm the only substantive reviews are negative and about all the bugs,  not a good signI use it daily. Remember it only works in the high power USB slot. The one closest to the front.  Took us a while to realize that's why ours weren't workingThat is a much better solution, thanks.+1 for you. I've found for the last couple of weeks that my iPhone 4 lasts less than 24 hours with the 3G on permanently. Which sucks for me because it was good for two days before that. My service provider doesn't seem to agree that there's a problem.True. Open Console.cpp and see if you can catch some logged error when the problem happenWell if you don't want to spend the $2 to check it out that's your choice obviously.  It does claim to do much of what you want and it has been updated several times since most of those negative reviews were written, check the version number on them.  Also see this review from MacWorld http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=565792&expand=trueThanks Merchako for a great answer, but unfortunately my hard-drive was knackered so I couldn't retrieve the data from it. I should have mentioned that in the original question.That is a fascinating article, but this is not how the autorotation works as the gyroscope was new in the iPhone 4 and autorotation has been supported since the first gen iPhone.Update: I managed to install Ubuntu on a different partition and configure to recognize the parition and default boot it by installing http://refit.sourceforge.net/myths/ - still the issue of running OS X as a virtual machine under this Ubuntu is not solved yet.I ask you the same as he asked to the the other, do you have any prooflink? would be nice..I gone back to the store, thanks! Now I'll read about synchronization using Rhythmbox or iTunes with wine.. :)Could be, but that isn't a great reason; you have to rotate it anyway for applications that only run in landscape mode.@kate that's precisely why jailbreaking exists and is legal (get the features we want). main issue is that it's still hard maintenance (keeping everything in sync, updated and backed up).What you mean 20 meg limit " via iTunes on __mac__ "? If you meant iOS iTunes on iPhone, then the limit exists but it can be jailbroken! Maybe that's enough to solve your issues. ;)edited to make that more clear, and unless there's a button in the native iTunes app on iPhone that says Get All Latest Episodes then it won't solve all my issues.  I don't really have a problem with the 20meg limit if i would be downloading 10 podcasts but if I just want to download one, thats when it becomes an issueI'll have to buy it and check it out... 2 dollars is worth getting rid of this headache - though once i buy something and get it working the way i want apple will probably solve this issue and do it the right wayThat's a bit my experience too. That's why I'd gladly hear about a more successful adoption  :-)Thanks I found it independently and was coming back to say so. You get the rep for answering before me :)Ummm http://cl.ly/4WL8 ?

Anyway, I'm glad it worked.Great, I used the wallpaper for the lock screen, thanks!10 recent documents is the default on Mac OS X. Edit `~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist` (entry named `NSRecentDocumentsLimit`) to see if Office uses this setting for its limit.This may provide a clue, or provide additional information in any answer. But it is worth taking into account that Office applications don't just display recent items in the menu, they also display them in a window that appears when you start one of the office applications. Another approach to gathering this info could be if someone could save, say 13 dummy documents, then look in ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.plist they should be able to see how many "File Alieses" were stored agains that application. @Daniel BeckIt appears that PowerPoint is represented by the value `PPT3`.You can delete your own question I think, rather than vote to close.@mankoff: I think I might leave it. In my case my machine won't chime so the Cmd-V solution doesn't work.Why the downvote? His edit about cmd+v occurred after I posted.So are you saying that when you launch the Boot Camp utility and it tells you to insert the DVD and press "Start Installation", you completely ignore that step, and instead reboot the machine from the USB key?It won't work on earlier models.You can stop the jumping by unchecking "When switching app, switch space" at the bottom of the Spaces system pref pane.@mankoff: cool. Didn't know about that. Still shows the apps in other spaces, but that's better.Thanks for the quick answer, do you know if it exists in Edit > Special Characters?Thank you! - I must have hit shift five times in a row for some reason.I can't find it there.Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4074/how-do-i-type-a-command-character-in-mac-os-x@Senseful - exactly! I close Boot Camp and reboot, then when the boot loader comes up instead of selecting the first option "Boot Mac OS X from Macintosh HD" I press the right arrow and select Windows on Disk 1. After that it's a normal windows install exactly as if the USB key were a DVD. It will reboot after copying the files and on the first reboot you select Windows on Disk 1 again, on the second reboot after it's done installing a third icon will appear in the boot loader "Boot Windows from Partition 3" you can now boot into Windows and eject your USB key.@joshhunt I prefer do it without make it ugly..Is there any way to find out how to type the symbol given a specific keyboard layout? I'm using a custom layout which I created and noticed that Shift-Option-K only works if I switch back to the US layout. Thus, it would be useful if there was an easy way to figure out which keyboard shortcut I need to use on my custom layout.@Senseful if you've enabled the `Keyboard & symbol` menulet from `Preferences` -> `Keyboard` you can use it to open a virtual keyboard. While pressing any modifier keys the pictured virtual keyboard will change accordingly.Thanks @Griffo. That Safe Boot with status (Cmd-Shift-V) would have been handy. I resolved it though (and got my system restored from TimeMachine). Had to install the OS clean, then do a restore-from-TM on first boot of OS X.That is also my understanding, if you are using Google Sync or CalDav, sync occurs as soon as anything chances.Cool, was that just because of your own circumstances or is that the normal procedure?I followed all those steps exactly.  This is what I see when I look at the .webarchive file I made:  https://files.me.com/azdesertfather/yutxdw  I made it in TextEdit and saved as .webarchive, but I also tried doing it in Word as an .html then bringing that into Safari to make it a .webarchive.  Both ways, same weird problem...yes, I followed.. When I edit on ipod it synchronizes, but when I edit on the website it does not update the ipod.. I edited this morning, I I'm connected since an hour but the ipod doesn't update..It's worth noting that [this symbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U+F8FF) is non-standard; it will be interpreted differently by different fonts.@koiyu: that's exactly what I was looking for, thanks.that worked! The only thing is that I was a bit confused trying to follow your directions. I launched the USB key and began the installation process, then it restarted. According to your directions, you mentioned that Partition 3 only appears after the second reboot, but I saw it after the first. I followed your directions and chose Partition 1, though, and that's what completed the installation. So aside from that little issue, it worked as you describe. Thanks!The boot camp instructions say to begin the installation within OS X, so I'm not sure I want to risk a botched install. Thanks for the suggestion though.I think it does work on the older models if you _also_ have the latest model (iPad, iPhone 4 or 4th gen iPod Touch). You can register the new device to get the free Find My iDevice account then register other devices on that account.Yeah i see what your saying, theres no real way of knowing. Just putting it out there in case any one else has had this problem and found a solution. Its probably from one of the tweaks i got from cydia.If you do find it, be sure to let us know. If it helps just one other person, it's worth it.Why? What's wrong with it?Wake On LAN requires another computer on the subnet to be awake, or the Router to support WoL. If this was the case, LogMeIn would already offer the 'Wake Up This Computer' option.I believe the both Apple Airport Express and TimeCapsule support this feature.Yes, that is correct. And also other routers have this feature, for example WRT54GL (I'm using this one).I realize the docs say I should hear a chime, but I do not. I got the apple logo, no chime. I'd film it for you, but I've since fixed the machine by doing a clean OS X install and then restoring from TimeMachine during the first login.I have tried what you have suggested. The problem is that filters containing "is:", "in:" or "label:" will never match incoming emails. You get a warning message if you use them in the "Create a Filter" screen and press "Next Step". I have tried it anyway but the filter actions did not get triggered. Conversely if I use a filter like "-is:important" the actions get triggered for both important and unimportant mail. So forwarding based on importance seems to be impossible.No, I didn't click on erase, I have the log form disk utility.G. I am not very comfortable with AppleScript but have no problems learning.

The answer should contain the details, and current answers already contains enough good details. Thanks!Thanks for the tip, this is very similar to what I was looking for. It's much better than having to copy every single file you want over.And you must add to your Microsoft office explanation that Mac version didn't support rtl languages right.That Moving Windows tip is awesome. Thanks.@Am1rr3zA : Given the accepted answer, the requirement you added in was *not* part of my question. Ideally I did not want an entirely seperate application, but zenopolis' answer provided third party software that integrates into iTunes. It's quite a bit buggy, but I'm using it and I love it. Needless to say, I rolled back your edit, because it was inaccurate.Cawas, "is legal" is not the same as "not illegal". It's hard for me to explain, but just because Jailbreaking "is not illegal" does not mean it's legal to do. Call it an unenforceable law. If it were legal, Apple would provide the tools and sanction it, this isn't the case. I think it has to do with the EULA too.Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/960/how-can-i-restrict-mac-sharing-services-to-a-specific-network-adapter@Jonathan Mayhak: "I don't have an MacBook Air" - why do you have the USB installer stick for one, then?

If you read carefully the "next step" warning it says "the criteria is not recommended because they will never match **incoming** email", which makes a lot of sense. filtering or searching for "-is:important" brings important mail because it's conversations with both unimportant and important messages, but got marked as "important", just like when you star a single message shows the whole conversation as starred. anyways, **summing up**, it's all google's engineering flaws and nothing we can do to solve it.Actually I do.

What about folks that have an iPhone and an iPod? What about folks who get a new phone? Technically iTunes could transfer these apps back and forth between devices without downloading a second time from Apple, but that is a HUGE pain in the butt compared to just simply allowing multiple downloads. Apple would never consider creating THAT much friction for AppStore shoppers. This is how Apple works.

- A timeline with all the tweets
- List management
- Twitter search

wouldn't mind having an app that has both functionalities (tweet text and
tweet images)Thanks for putting that more correctly than I could :). @Cawas: Additionally, Jailbreaking relies on security vulnerabilities.

The only improvement I'd want is to allow it to work over bluetooth instead of wifi (even with the slower data transmission), but iOS doesn't allow for that yet. In places where wifi devices can't see each other (public wifi, mostly, like coffee shops) it doesn't work at all. I can set up an ad hoc wifi network to my MacBook and have it work, but then I can't access the internet. Still, great stuff.What's the difference between "browsing with no images or video" and "text-only browsing"?Oh, I see what you mean. I did not know you had an Air. Yup, the Air does not have an optical drive; so the only way to get Mac OS X is on a USB drive. 

In theory it should work just the same that on a regular MacBook using the DVD. I am not aware of any particular issues with Boot Camp and the Air. Having said that, it helps to have the latest Boot Camp tools. Apple just pushed an update to my Boot Camp partition yesterday. Try it out to see if it helps. Good luck."Just google it" is not an accepted answer on the stack exchange network. The whole point is to have concise documentation on the question to the point it's relevant.As long as all your forks are based off the same trunk, I don't think it would cause any issues. Regarding moving between Macs, the virtualized hardware should stay the same from the VM OS's perspective (I think), so it would likely not be considered a new PC. Really, I haven't virtualized W7 much, so I can't speak to the specific issue at hand as much as I can to virtualizing WinXP.Cost:  Although when thinking about it last night, to get a screen that is that good will cost you about 1.2k anyway.Why would it be better to buy a iMac for long term?@Nathan The biggest benefit in buying an iMac, in my opinion, is that you get the warranty. At the price point of an iMac, the Apple extended warranty will cover every component. Honestly, this is the primary reason I opted for an iMac in my own iMac vs Hackintosh debate.I would say the biggest advantage is it just works out of the box. You don't have to worry about additional kexts, incompatible hardware, etc etc. Just open the box, set it up, and get rolling getting stuff done.@Ryan very valid point.@Nathan W I've got a 24" Dell 1080x1920 nonglossy. It's been great. It cost me $180.Steve, no. Unlocked? Maybe. Not jailbroken. Woz, yes.Thanks, but that didn't work for me. Looks like it hasn't been an actively developed piece of software for a couple of years either.I agree, I've been using biteSMS since I've asked this question and I love it.W Unfortunately Nathan G is right, the 1080p 21" iMac model isn't anything special in terms of monitor specs.Not officially supported without manually choosing a disk in System Prefs.

I'm not talking about a bluetooth PAN or something like this. I refer to a simple bluetooth connection between a Human-Input Device (HID) and my Macbook.Problem is, I need to get everyone to enqueue songs on the same playlist on the same mac.@Ryan Ok well that rules out that argument.

You can forward ports on one of the machines and you are in. As for option 2 - i've edited my answer, forgot the part about additional software. Also i've added an extra option you can use, which may be is the best choice :)@Asmus It makes a window pop up that says "Disk Image".OK so I changed the script to use the string "Disk Image" rather than "Image". I'm now one step further: it mounts the image and opens the finder to where the dmg file is. But the image itself is not opened up.For option 1, asymmetric connection speed (my upstream sustained speed tops out at 1 Mbps) makes it impractical to do remotely.  Option 6 is probably the second-best, only behind basilmir's suggestion of ExFAT (it'd probably be easiest to use a live-CD distro inside virtualbox).you are right, it works! Very nice stuff. Props, man...50 rep was a good deal for all that work. :)@zevlag - A Follow up: *NO RESPONSE* thus far. :-(That could be. At which point I assume I am screwed.I was going to suggest the same thing. Change your home router's base IP to something like 192.168.2.xxx -- everyone seems to be using 192.168.0.xxx these days and conflicts abound. Had the exact same problem with my home network and a client's VPN'ed network a few months back.@Isaac i see ... well connection speed is definitely a bummer in your case :) As for balsimir's suggestion - I must say that I didn't see it until now :) It is a lot better if it works as it sounds, you should try it.I [just went through getting Screen Sharing to work for me so I could cut JollysFastVNC out of my workflow](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5966/mac-to-mac-screen-sharing-doesnt-work-just-hangs). :) If possible I'd like to not go back to a paid VNC solution.

That is exactly what I'm looking for to do backups to my own S3 space.Reeder integrates Readability as well as Instapaper. And there's a beta of an OS X version, too.This is unfortunately true. The actual active Psi developers switched Swift, but it's supposed to be "simple" and I believe it won't have the option you seek.While I do think Dropbox is great, I don't think this solves the issue. The problem is that the pdf is downloaded to the iPad, and OP wants to move it to PC. Currently Dropbox on iPhone/iPad doesn't enable the "Open in" functionality, to allow moving the pdf from iBooks/email to Dropbox. I wish it did, however.If Psi did not work (and the "Automatically Get Info" box was checked at the bottom, it is the default), I suspect your server does not allow node browsing. I posted a screenshot of my Jabber Server, and you'll see that the rooms that actually have people in it are listed.Dropbox on iOS devices does support "Open in", its the icon on the top-right. (I just verified with my iPad to be sure.)Any proper Jabber client should work, since it implements the protocol. One not very well known fact is that Google Talk is a Jabber implementation, so you can add Talk accounts to your Jabber ID, even if it's not hosted by Google.I also use Beejive, it's a solid client for the various popular protocols and I'm not sure you can get much better than it.You do know that many emacs keybindings just work in OS X apps, right? C-a and C-e, for example, move to front and end of a text line in TextEdit, the Safari URL bar, etc.@mankoff : Yes, I do. However, I just wanted to know if I can have 'C-x C-s' also.Glad to help. Careful that you remember the password that you set. I forgot mine and didn't save it in my keychain so I couldn't restore the library when I did a system restore. Fortunately I had it on another backup.Are you just editing XML specific to the Mac (like 'plist' and 'sdef') or are you editing a variety of schemas?As @Mr Andyface mentions a few answers below, doing this thru iTunes and iBooks is a good alternative. Plus it gives you the extra benefit that you are keeping a backup of your PDF's in your iTunes library.@Sorin this is a question regarding glitchy UI behavior; images are perfectly appropriate and helpful in describing the problem.I've now verified that it worked to move to a WinXP box updated with the special ExFAT update, so I'll assume that Win7 should be no problem.  Thanks!I just verified that the ExFAT solution does in fact work, so that is the best way, at least for my specific situation.  I didn't know 10.6 had ExFAT support until that answer, either.@Philip : I wanted a general solution to parse the XML files.Are your accounts set to forward to each other? Are you sure you set them both up, not one of them twice? 

When you get the dual emails, to which account were they sent?1) No. 2) Yes. 3) Same behavior on both accounts.Have you tried deleting and re-adding one of them?*boggles* Umm, wow. That's true, because Alt Command Esc brings up Force Quit. I must test this for real to ensure that's the case.You asked what the interfaces were, not how virtual LANs work.  Virtual LANs are just that.  You can create collision domains without using a physical device, simply by setting it up to "group" certain ports together, into the same virtual LAN segment.  Typically, as in a physical network, vlans can't talk to each other, just like LAN segments can't talk to each other when divided by a router.  Typically.@Griffo what would like to know more about?Agree on being buggy - shows promise though.Link to OS X beta: http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reederPossible duplicate of [What's in the "Other" category on my iPad?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7853/whats-in-the-other-category-on-my-ipad/)Tried multiple times, but problem still persist.I don't remember their names, but I remember seeing 3-5 Cydia apps over time that did just this.The OP specifically asks for compression, but I can't see any indication that sparse images are compressed.About the built-in method, I'm not seing it on my phone (I'm in France), I believe it's AT&T only.thanks i will trysame question as http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4699/how-to-set-to-open-folder-with-enter-in-finderit has really bad reviews :(it doesn't have good reviews and their support website it doesn't even have the app, I would run away from this.couldn't find that when I was writing my question, will look through it.interesting, it was marked as "manually", but there's no way to do it manually.. XDiFile is actually free, but it asks for donation in such a way that you pay for it like any paid app, if so you wish.@Cawas I'm referring to http://iphone.heinelt.eu/?Applications:iFile It seems to me that it is not freeI've updated my question, not jailbroken, so that part doesn't change anything.  However, I'm having a hard time understanding how contacts, notes, calendars and SMS messages can account for 3.1gb of space.  I don't download email to the phone, I use either IMAP / Exchange.  Even if it were to cache the contents of these mailboxes, they're less than 1gb in total which still leaves me at a loss for all this space.Sorry, that' didn't help.  Thanks for the idea though because it helped me figure out why some videos weren't being synced to my phone.What if I don't have a 'File Sharing' section?  I'm on IOS 4.2.1 and 10.2.1.17.  Does this just mean I don't have any apps with file sharing?Super nice !

Thanks for making a really crappy day a little bit better.Perhaps there is a language barrier here, but I'm voting to close as not a real question.Same here. @germanus Can you provide more information?Andris, I don't think Cydia has more than 1 [iFile](http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/iFile.php). As I said, when you open it on cydia it's blue like any paying app and it does say $4. But look at the blue button. It doesn't say "buy" (at least it didn't use to). And it does say "Commercial Package + Free Trial". I got it for free, I use it very rarely so I didn't want to pay for it and I can just keep using it. It's like any other free trial on cydia, but it doesn't have a time limit.Sounds like this person has a Mac that can't find a system folder.  And yeah, without a bootable external disk or a DVD it's not going to startup.you're talking about that? http://i.imgur.com/6o7ro.jpgPrevious versions of iFile were completely free. Now, when I open it it says "iFile is now ShareWare" and ask for a donation. I find it a very nice way of doing business since I'm not paid in U$ and 1 buck is something I have to take care on how to spend because if I just go and buy every app I use I would go broke.

"HTML5" is not the answer, because the built in YouTube application isn't "HTML5", for example.Protocols and codecs are two very different things. A protocol is a communication method, codec stands for Compressor/Decompressor. HTTP is a protocol, H.264 is a codec.1. I'm usually programming on an 11" macbook air so vertical space is at a premium.Thanks, but if you re-read my question, you'll find that there are actually two files 64MB each.  It's not just 2 to 25MB.  It's 128MB total swap and 2 to 25MB usage.  What I find annoying, is that the total swap varies between 64 and 128MB.  This would seem to indicate that the 2nd swap file is being deactivated then recreated.  That's a lot of disk use for nothing.  I already knew of the two system mods you suggested, and indicated that I didn't like the 1st one.  The 2nd one, I find to be not well engineered.@peanutbutter I'd put the dock on the side if I were using an 11" Macbook Air@kiamlaluno: same problem here, including the 'sealed resource is missing message...'That is correct! question can you browse youtube with html5 enabled? http://www.youtube.com/html5 ?You don't have the "File Sharing" section when you choose the "Apps" tab? The "Apps" tab I am referring to is the same one where you choose which apps to sync and where you can arrange the apps on your home screens. If you are in that tab and find no "File Sharing" section down at the very bottom then maybe you don't have apps with "File Sharing".
Another thing that came to mind is whether you have a Twitter client or an RSS client that is pulling info down daily and sticking it in "Other."Flash can be hardware accelerated as well, it's not just h.264Thanks this works well.@Fake Name, was not aware that flash can be h/w accelarated.

Further, [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1660/make-iphone-clock-alarms-obey-vibrate-only-mode/1661#1661) suggests that the calendar alarms *do* obey the silent switch...@Kevin: I didn't know that but thanks for the tip. I'm in book publishing, so Acrobat is always within easy reach.Guitar effects for performers.  webOS, WP7, and Android do not offer an official API to low latency audio processing currently.

The quick-add for new appointments is awesome.FUSE is a wonderful thing. Thanks!@Kevin: Thanks for the tip. I tried it, but it's quality is much lower than the original. Acrobat Standard's reduce file size maintains the some quality, but doesn't reduce the file by much. It seems that the trick is to combine the file in Acrobat rather than Preview (see [my answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8563/why-does-combining-a-pdf-cause-its-size-to-be-significantly-larger/8603#8603)).Perfect, thanks.While Gordon Davisson is right, you should be aware that aliases and symbolic links (symlinks) are different. `ln -s` makes symlinks. The Finder makes aliases. They are almost identical in practical, common use, but it's important to recognize that *they are different*. Symlinks point to a directory path, while aliases point to a file. If you have both pointing to the same file and you move the file to a different folder, then make a new file in the old folder, the alias will point to the moved original and the symlink will point to the new file.If this is possible it's pretty cool. I have a feeling it is not. I couldn't find a way to select multiple files from a LaunchBar file search. All key+select operations I tried just selected one file.@Cajun: thanks for the clarification. It's confusing that finder shows a symbolic link's "Kind" property as "Alias".I would suggest doing it in your hosts file, but I don't have my mac with me right now, so I can't confirm that works...Surprising. And awesome to know.I second Calivetica -


I just wish it would show the current day without it needing to be a badgeFlash is GPU accelerated in the last few months (for Mac). Flash has been GPU accelerated in Windows for maybe a year?

That's awesome!You used a full path, not the `~` helper.Tab completion is a wonderful thing too, if you were to do this: `ln -s ~/Foo<tab>` (where <tab> denotes the actual ?

No wifi at all. They knew the routers wouldn't be able to handle it after the CP in 2010, which practically burned and broke a few of them. So, yes, this is a very valid problem. But I'd still hope for a better solution...I apologize. I have the standard keyboard, which uses two different symbol for the Enter/Return key (one of those symbols is "?", the Unicode Projective character); it seems I said _Enter_ when I should have said _Return_.There's one more thing to Brazil app store quite unique to most of the rest of the world stores... Games are forbidden. The only games you see in there are cleverly not categorized as such. I know this because the company I'm working on had this exact problem releasing its game in Brazil plus about 3 other countries.Truly one of the things that annoyed me most when I switched to Mac a few years ago was deciphering all of those symbols every time I wanted to learn a keyboard shortcut for something.Thanks. I wasn't able to carve Divvy into what I really wanted (single-key, pixel explicit), but trying to do that I stumbled upon SizeUp, which does exactly that!Edited the question to ask if I can do the same thing but with more than one layout.Actually, "Kind contains 'video'" misses some that have a Kind of "Quicktime movie".  I added "Kind contains 'video'" OR "Kind contains 'movie'" and it seems to be working now.Hey, would you mind marking this as the accepted answer?+1 for WiFi Photo Transfer, very useful.+1 That's a pretty good app. The only drawbacks I see are that it doesn't play music in the background, and you can't scrub through songs.Thanks Senseful. :)Heh, "not hard." For the uninitiated, as I was until googling this through, I'll add some starting steps: Launch Terminal, type `vim` and *Return*, type `i`. Now you're in insert mode. After that, however, I have no idea. *Control-v* doesn't appear to do anything, and *Return* appears to enter a carriage return while *Enter* does nothing.I eventually did it in a similar way, only from Parallels, since I didn't have a windows pc handy.Bravo!  Learned a lot on this one +1 thanksYikes.  You are correct.  Editing.Everything that anyone needs to know about Mac key commands can be found [in this question](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193/keyboard-icons-terminology) (part of this site's FAQ).+1, and I'll add nvALT, a fork of Notational Velocity that adds support for Markdown, Textile and MultiMarkdown in Preview and a bunch more: http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/If I go into System Preferences > Displays, I don't see any such setting.I finally sprung for it and couldn't be happier. It works *really* well with my Mac and with my WinXP computer. Definitely got my money's worth.Thanks for helping GZ, it's nice when a company cares that much (or at least its employees :). To clarify, you say that with the Airline Adapter I CAN power the MacBook Air, at least partially right? I don't really care about fully charging it as long as I can power it during like ~3 sunlight hours. You said you could do this with your larger panels, so could I accomplish this with the 7m or only the 13.5+? (product selling motivation aside ;) Also, would it charge if I used a 3rd party car adapter? Just curious, if it's really 6.5v why does it say <22v? Is that after it's transformed or what?Also, if you have time, this website may help you with your Goal0 endevours, too:  http://pangea.stanford.edu/~schmitt/magsafe/Oho! I thought that there was no way to detect this!I'm aware of the screen auto dimming, but this is not when I experience this effect. Usually I will be using the computer right before I press the brightness button, meaning that it shouldn't be in auto-dim mode.Any reason not to just deinstall refit?Interesting. All my experience comes from Cruzers with the U3 technology too, but last I knew it was all read-only and couldn't be changed.@Dori: I like its menu better than the default Mac OS X menu.I'd recommend renaming to "iPhone to iPhone" because that app only transfer over bluetooth between iPhones, unlike the iBlueNova.@Senseful: screen shot from Apple here: http://support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT4293/HT4293-led_display_27inch-display_system_prefs-001-en.pngI don't have the same problem with Google Chrome.-1 DUH same thingSolid State Drive is very different from a flash based drive. Learn to do your research before voting down. SSD uses more NAND than a normal flash drive (which is in the iPad), SSD is 8 - 12, while a flash drive (which is in the iPad) uses 1 - 2.Also, check the iPad tech specs from the Apple web site. 16, 32, and 64 GB flash drive. Not SSD, if it was SSD it would be clearly labeled that way.@klutch2 An SSD is "8 - 12", and a flash drive uses "1 - 2"? What does that mean?Not inches, NAND Flash Memory chips.Have you taken a look on http://www.quicklookplugins.com/ ? There might already be quicklook plugin for your filetype...Flash [IS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) basically the same technology as SSD only the performance of SSD is higher and accordingly the price. @Brian Carlton has a more relevant answer to the question.It does indeed use an icmp_echo_request to determine if the host is up or not.@Cawas Even if it is legal (and I'm not sure it is in all countries), it still might a breach of the terms of service of your carrier.It's not bloated with features, the price seems quite OK, and it works just perfectly. Thanks for pointing it out! Changed the accepted answer to this one. (Just let me add a link for easier reference: http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/ )I'm dealing with a digital camera RAW file. The preview is created by the camera and doesn't reflect any changes I've made in my RAW converter.Actually the behavior is not that unicornish if you think about it. The longer the distance it falls, the more time it can sense the acceleration and turn off the hard drivesPossibly a duplicate of - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8793/the-browser-doesnt-show-videos-on-youtubeDoes anyone know for sure?If you fixed it yourself, please add what fixed it as an answer.Hey Senseful, Let me know how this worked outThanks Cawas. Done.This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Thank you!i want sharing to still work, since I share other folders.  I just don't want the users home folder to show up in the list of shares.+1 for Homebrew.I've seen an issue before where things got bent inside the 3.5mm headphone jack so that it thought there were always headphones plugged in/it was trying to output optical audio. I don't suppose that could be the issue?But you can select and deselect which folders are shared, in that option. If I'm still getting your question correct :DI reset the Mac, installed the latest version of the Flash plug-in, but I still cannot see Youtube videos. I don't have any problems watching the Flash animations that are in the [Adobe Flash page](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/).Jaydles - perfect response, thanks! Sorted out the issue straight away.for what I understand of the question (which is not really clear), what deiga is saying is right. Selecting File Sharing in the list on the left shows on the right options to add or remove folders that are shared. You would probably have to do that for every user though.More or less impossible to answer this question precisely. Of course, if you feel like jailbreaking you could always install MyWi, but not sure if that's an option for you or not.SiteSucker is great.@Chirag Tho that's true for a Macbook with sensor, i'm talking about internal/external regular PC drives that fell from different altitudes with unpredictable results.I know it because when I verify the disk permissions, I get the "Permissions differ on [filename]" error message; when I repair the permissions (either from the terminal or from the Finder), I get the same message, followed by "Repaired [filename]". The problem is that, repairing again the permissions immediately after, I get the same list of files, as if the first time the permissions were not really repaired.Yes, I have the same symptom with files that are currently in use. Read my edit :)For more information about how to use Ukelele, see this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2767/decimal-comma-in-spanish-keyboard-layout/2768#2768the Mac Pro (2,1) and the Mac Pro (1,1) share the same hardware requirements?I put off my wifi when charging, and I'm not too sure whether third party apps are allowed to run in background or not. See [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4742/how-to-check-what-causes-iphone-battery-to-drain-out/4743#4743)I know for sure that my Google Latitude is constantly updating my status in the background so it's using GPS all the time. You actually didn't mention which iPhone you have, did you buy it new and how long you have it already.@Andris strictly speaking, it'd only be contract breach if the contract specifically said something about "jailbreaking". Otherwise, you're most probably talking about carrier unlock. I've had iPhone for over 2 years always broke it jail free and I have never unlocked the carrier. In fact, historically jailbreaking is not even the only way to do it.Will using active cooling pads solve the problem?Like Philip, my home button does not work from a particular angle. Though the sleep button has always worked. I occasionally have this problem with an intensive process running, it just takes a while to wake. But if yours never wakes, different problem. Just saying, consider a minor hardware problem first.cmd+space does not work in the login screen, unless specifically enabled.I'm using iPhone 4@Jon It might work, though usefulness of cooling pads is highly contested. I'd recommend you try a cooling pad from a friend or ask the shop if you can try it out before you buy it.Doesn't googles own [Latitude](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-latitude/id306586497?mt=8) cover this?BTW, turn **off** your mac before cleaning it!i don't follow. I am not seeing any option to add a location. I can only order the wireless connectionsCan you explain *why* you're trying to repair permissions? 99% of the times it's recommended, the initial problem isn't one that could even be caused by a permissions issue.Exactly my experience!!! Used Mac OSX inside a VM for a couple of months of occasional use and got totally addicted, purchased a MacBook Pro as soon it was possible for my finances.Thank you, drury, for posting this issue. I thought I was the only one left in the world who didn't get why Apple consistently does such counterintuitive things. Whatever the rationale behind it, it's tech-thinking going against simple, default human preferences. And isn't making personal computing simple and logical what Apple's OSes are supposed to be all about? Lord knows it's why `I` bought a Mac. Thanks again.No option for "none" in the US either. I purchased a used Iphone for cheap as a toy, guess I'll only use jailbreak apps. I'm glad I've never been rammed bloody in the  rear end by Apple for full retail price for their locked down crap.This doesn't answer your specific question, but permissions on your home folder will prevent people from looking at your stuff so i wouldn't worry about it being on (unless you changed the permissions). If you didn't, the only thing they would see is Public, Sites and every other doc you created in the root of your home (with +r to group / others )Not true. There is a tutorial out there telling u how to set it up with linux. Google it. I think it works with any printer.Uninstall Flash is not a possibility in the moment, because other sites do not support HTML 5 in the moment.@Bryson there's Reeder for Mac. http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reederI highly disagree with @Kyle closure of this question. Looking at [iOS version history](1), and knowing a bit about apple, we can predict some dates. Unfortunately I don't know all that much about apple as I've never witnessed any of their release.

Anyway, it will most likely come before June / July this year, when they must release iOS 5 or some other major release. There are rumors about February 28th and I believe it won't go beyond March.@deiga only on iOS 4 devices with multitasking enabled (iPhone 3G doesn't have it by default). Longitude works on any iOS 3 device, you can set the refresh rate up to 4 hours and I'd bet it consumes less memory and battery.I was actually hoping for a file to read, but that's probably better asked on StackOverflow.I ended up buying a OWC 240Gb SSD Pro (not the extreme) and I'm sooo happy with the choice :)the none option works only in ITUNES 9.....


NOW I AM ENJOYING AND DOWNLOADING APPS.......!!!!!!!What is a color swap? Do you experience such problem without jailbreak?Nope, no red light.@gbrandt does the backup software use the share-only-users' home folder, or is it that just an account is needed? (much like a system account for processes)Yes, I tried restoring to the original software without jailbreak, but with no luck. By color swap I mean changing the front and the back of the phone.+1 for Gruber's article. I did this to all of my Macs and I noticed they all perked up a bit. I really didn't want yet another browser to use, but I also didn't need Flash enough to justify having it available all the time at the system level.Then this really weird, since you shouldn't be seeing `Digital Out`, unless the digital switch inside the jack is turned on.How long ago did the warranty expire?Presumably this means she has an intel iMac. I strongly recommend upgrading to a newer version of Photoshop (or perhaps Photoshop Elements), as running an Intel-native version will be much faster.@deiga: It's nearly 2 years old now, so it's been out of warranty for almost a year.@IntuitionHQ: Could very well be the case, though it's weird that it'd successfully detect actual headphones. Is there any way to disable digital out?The digital out switch is inside the jack, putting and pulling out the headphone jack a few times might help.I've been inserting/removing a heaphone for months (just got around to reformatting & asking now) and it hasn't helped. :-\Can you open `/Applications/Utilities/Console.app` and tell us, what the errors are from the MySQL installer?if you are correct, then why is itunes syncing all of MY apps with my wife's iphone.  we have different apple idsThat seemed like a mighty large stone to kill a very small bird, but it works fine :)@ooo - Like I said, you need to specify which apps to sync. iTunes automatically syncs all available apps disregarding "ownership" of the apps.Also could you include which Jailbreak you are using. That will probably make it easier to solve.I have actually not missed it much and I don't mind launching Chrome every once in awhile.thanks.  so for paid apps, you can use on different devices with different apple ids?@ooo - Yes you can use them, you just can't update them on the "wrong" Apple ID.Thanks for your help! Makes sense what you're saying - I thought about it myself, but like I said everything seems to be working fine (both cameras, accelerometer, proximitymeter, wifi, antennas etc). I reopened it and everything looks ok. The only thing that looks off is a small scratch on the cable connecting the battery. Could that be it? I mean it turns on and it charges etc, so why would it shortcut the battery AFTER 3 min of working?Or there could be a contact problem with some of the parts after fiddling inside the phone :)thanksMaybe there's a springboard process (different that the boot process) reading the battery information every 3 minutes, and since there's a time out, try to respring to "fix" it. Maybe the respring is a bug, a scratch on the battery cable is not something common and so maybe it's not tested. At that point, it's nearly impossible to determine for us.Try to go to an Apple Repair Shop, it won't be covered by the warranty, but your phone cannot really be used right now, so try to see if them repairing the phone is not too expensive.At which point of the installation does the error occur? Did you follow these steps? <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/macosx-installation-pkg.html>The backup requires a full user on the computer, a shares only user does not work, I tried.  I am backing up mail from our mail server in the CoLo, to a local machine in a fashion that allows our local machine become the mail server in emergencies. (SL Server in Colo, SL Client local)What sort of calendar is it? Google/Mobile Me? Just on iCal on your Mac and iPhone?Thanks Graham. I found one relatively useless command.yes, i have followed the complete steps, in the last part, the error occurs, last time when I have installed it was perfect. I guess i need to remove something prior installing. Please help. To be precise in the installation step.you have a point in the battery check process. I'm afraid I know what it's going to cost, since Apple dont repair iphones but simply send you a new one (what I heard). Such "repair" _with_ warranty is 350USD.I am breaking my head over it, don't have any clue how to fix it.a plain `.ics` file provided from a URLAgreed.  Flash really is a timewaster, and chromium is my work browser.  Sadly I've been hearing the fans again on gmail pages.Make sure you have a Mac that is actually supported by SnowLeopard. Iirc, only Intel-Macs are supported.search for vim-markdown on github@Cawas The only answers to this question will be pure speculation, the correctness of which can only be determined *after* iOS 4.3 comes out, at which time this question becomes no longer relevant.@Kyle I agree. But he is asking for speculation. And even then there can be agreement over statistical expectations, which could be showed by answers being voted - just like any other question on these boards.If it was that easy, I wouldn't need to ask this question.When it happened to my computer, it also would detect the fact that headphones had been inserted. Similar to what deiga says, the jack get locks in a certain mode (headphone or optical) and will no longer output audio to the internal speakers.

If you're comfortable messing around inside your computer, you can try and open it and bend the jack around a little and it could well solve your problem. You could always try deigas solution with a toothpick as well - although I preferred to just get straight inside and fix the issue directly.

Good luck either way.but what about shared content??@geermc4  I do not want users storing data in those home folder shares.  So I don't want to give them access at all.No - You need the BoxSet to upgrade from Tiger the simple upgrade is for Leopard only - the link you give to Snow Leopard says thatThat's where it is more confusing. Probably easier on the iPad or iPhone to switch to the account that first bought the app and then re-download the app.PS, it wasn't me who down voted.Good lord, indeed you can. Excellent, cheers Kyle!The question doesn't specify technically or according to the licensing terms. I'll clarify the answer.No problem @Ben, if I can think of anything else which might help I'll update the answer.  Some people just down-vote because they can.@Dori thanks for the retag! Hopefully, someone will know the answer to this soon. I hope Psi isn't the only option.  For whatever reason it didn't work, and my IT guy couldn't confirm that the server wasn't configured correctly as @VxJasonxV suggested.That model number is the battery number, it appears. Can you give the model of the camera itself?Do you only intend to ever be watching 1 site? And *all* you want to know is reachable or not?my thoughts exactly. Thanks.Also: What medium are you monitoring? Is ping enough? Are you checking accessibility of a website? SSH?@Paul: she sure does, and it seems to run plenty fast enough for her needs through Rosetta.Not an option, the users must have proper directories for my email backups to work.@klutch2 Just to clarify, I was quoting your ambiguous comment, not implying inches.@Jayant: THERE IS NO NEED TO SHOUT!!!could you tell us what the email backup software is? I'm curious as to why it needs a real user.What the OP is saying is that whenever you connect with a real account (and not a sharing-only one), that real user's home folder is automatically visible as a read-write folder. So if user "peter" connects and puts his password, he'll have a peter's home folder available (and only peter will have access to that). He wants to remove Peter's Home from the possible list of shares, something that the UI of the File Sharing screen doesn't allow.I believe the possibility to achieve that depends upon the reason why the program needs a real user. Can you elaborate more about your backup software?Would it be possible to include screenshots to clarify what you are talking about?You can update apps from several different accounts in a single iPhone/iPod/iPad. The App Store app will show that there is a new version for an app and when you try to update it will ask for the password of the account that originally downloaded the app. It is a bit of a nuisance, though.This script is situational anyways. I use it to enable "gaming mode" :D So I close all open apps that are not needed and open up my gaming client or tracker etc.  But yeah, I definitely should add some conditions to the start so that it would work in different casesAnd it is much cheaper than MS Office!Yay! This works! Thank you os much :)D&D is also very usefull for files to be used as parameters@Ipacheco - And when you input the password, then it tells you that your phone is not setup with this account and tells you to change the phones account to be able to update. As you an have only one Apple ID profile on the phone you'd have to switch between the different ID's all the time, and not just input the passwordWhen you turn the Air on, does the screen come on? Does the startup chime ring?Did you mean ejecting the CD/DVD?I am using USB ordinary keyboard not apple's standard keyboard.I tried to press ALT, I also tried F12. But none of them worked.Yes ! @HMage - I am not able to eject DVD.@sugar keeping the F12 key pressed didn't work?@sugar you could try to go to an Apple Store, and ask them to plug an Apple keyboard just to eject the DVD.@dori I don't think "restart" is the right term. @milosz didn't say the phone was restarting but only the springboard. Maybe "iPhone 4 Springboard is reset/restarted [...]". I'll let it up to you since I don't want to start an edit "war" :)Why you bought a MacBook when you delete the Mac OS and install Windows? You didn't use Parallels or other virtual machine, neither bootcamp?@Dori fair enough. completely agree on color swap + jailbreak.Unfortunately this one doesn't work with OS X >= 10.5 (I'm on Snow Leopard)That does the trick, esp. since I can set it always on top and then place it on top of the menu bar.I think you have a good experience SU.I'm using http://cutedgesystems.com/software/MailServeSnow/ I know I could probably dick around and get dovecot to use a normal mailstore, but I thought this might be easier as my system is already working.BTW, it also works in any Cocoa control (text area, etc.)I'd never worry about refresh rate. I just set my to sync with google calendar and as soon as I set anything on either end it's apparently pushed everywhere.Its even worse for me.

I am Australian and live in Thailand but work in Papua New Guinea.

I really hate how various interactive sessions make so many assumptions

Mal@ashes999 Similarly go to any place (events, other stores, etc) prone to find apple folks (fans, employees, etc) and you'll most likely be able to borrow a charge for long enough.I have received only 2 DVD, one is of os x install and the other is application DVD, I did not get which one are to talking about.there is no print menu!Excuse me? What are you trying to print?  One example, go to `Photos > Select an album > Select a photo > Push the leftmost button on the bottom (square wit arrow coming out) > Select Print`There is no print, just email, contact and background!Are you on WiFi?It's ?-click, not ?-click.I don't think that all apps support airprint, what app are you using? I can check if it works on mine or not as I have it set up and have printed before.BTW your printer is not on the list of supported devices...if you mount one of those DVD's there's an installer with apple development tools. I don't have DVDs with me at the moment.Actually 'touch something' is the method that I'm using. However, I need to open Terminal.app, cd to the directory, and run the command to get it done. Just write clicking would be better if possible.@deiga: Yes, Wifi with Same Network As Printer and Sharing macbookI have tried to run Windows Vista in VirtualBox but it was very bad, Mac OS X crashed often. I don't recommend VirtualBox on Mac when you have Windows as a guest.Somebody else mentioned Dropbox to me today, so I may have to investigate this. I added a link to your answer that give a quick tutorial.You could always make yourself a folder acton with Automator to get the same functionality. There is also [NuFile](http://www.growlichat.com/NuFile.php) which does what you want.@Arne - What app are you using, like TheX already asked? There is no sense that this menu doesn't show up :DI want a browser that isn't able to load images or video. I'm going for simplicity. Just text and hyperlinks, ignores everything else, including CSS.Also, check out http://www.quicklookplugins.com/ for more great plugins.Not to /usr/bin that should be Apple software only as an upgrade can delete anything in there. Use /usr/local/bin which is already on the pathThis question is about MobileMail, the iOS Mail application. Sorry for the confusion. The app is called MobileMail internally on iOS.@St3fan The same rule applies for all IMAP account testing I have done.Or just add `/usr/local/mysql/bin` to the `$PATH`.Haha.  That easy, huh?  Thanks.  My Linux habits and <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd> from the OSX GUI made me scratch my head.Cool.  Just throwing it out there.  The problems tend to manifest themselves as odd behaviour, usually quite a while after the migration gets done.  Always a pain.If this is on the OS X Server end, you can still have accounts that don't have homes.  If that's not a good solution I suppose you could always enforce a quota, and set it to 0MB.+1 I will go with OWC choice, because they do test each product they sell with working Macs.Depends as always on you consider "best" in this context.Note:  You need tons of memory for this to be any fun.   2 Gb of physical memory is probably not enough.Fusion will be a better choice. I use it sometimes for my Widows XP usage on 2009 15" MBP w/4GB RAM, it works fine.For the record. Parallels also support Bootcamp. Truth is the feature set between the two are the same.You might have killed `/usr/local/bin` but not with those commands. `touch foo; mkdir bar; mv foo bar` puts the `foo` file inside the `bar` folder, whether or not the `mv` command ends with `bar` or `bar/` or not.I got iOS 4.2.1 and it still happens.  Could it be a setting somewhere?I don't understand your reference to "Appid". Are you able to clarify a bit more?There isn't even a Games category in the brazilian store. It's a shame.I don't get that behavior with Shift. Did you have to change an option to get hiding to work like that?Try again with a different web browser. Do you have the same problem?this pretty much answers it.Are you using a USB hub?Yes, iTunesHelper is running.no, just figured I'd go for a 2nd opinion here :) - have a 'diagnostic' appointment with the Genius Bar tomorrow, but this machine is out of warranty, so dead logic board means it's a write off...Harv: no hub, and until... don't know when i never got this issue :(@Brant Bobby - Now, that's interesting.  Have you re-installed iTunes anyway?  Anything showing up in the console logs?  Have you tried a different computer?@3rdparty In that case, my second opinion confirms your first :).Thanks, I am able to log in to mysql, using $ ./mysql. I will add a symbolic link to /usr/local/bin. It will be great if you can assist me in creating the symbolic link or to update the $PATH variable, Thanks.@seh - No I didn't...at least I don't remember changing anything like this. This is on OS X 10.6.6, but I'm not sure if it's version related. Could also be that I've changed something while working on this SL installation, I haven't reinstalled since SL came out.If you start iTunes manually, does the iPhone get detected? Give a try on another computer (PC/Mac)...Which macbook pro do you have? Can you try with another USB port? Same behaviour?Thanks, but I would like to stick to Mac default provided. Apache HTTP server, PHP is configured in my MacBook Pro. The only missing link was MySql. I am able to figure it out, with expert guidance. :) More question will follow soon ...Yes, you are right. Windows (Any windows in this case) can update your drivers after install for you. You install the Bootcamp software from your OS X DVD and it will inform you when it has updates to install! :)Actually, you normally don't need the OS X partition installed for running Windows, though I'm not sure if this is applicable to the laptops with no drives. Apples EFI handles all the BIOS -emulation for Bootcamp and thus the installed OS X doesn't do anything.I have tried Mail, Photos and Safari - none of them has a print button!Thanks all, I have created a symbolic link for /usr/local/mysql/bin to /usr/local/bin. However there was no bin directory in /usr/local. So, I have created one. $cd /usr/local; mkdir bin; ln -s /usr/local/mysql/bin mysql. Thanks everyone.That's so weird considering it used to let you do it.  I'm trying to set the location of a batch and I don't want to do it one by one.

They've even got the batch change option, "place" should have been there before.  And it should be there now.Thanks deiga, I'm asking just to learn, I don't have a problem to fix. Next time I'm setting up a network for someone and it has a non system partition I will need to consider other users being able to access it. It's one of those bits of knowledge I couldn't explore for myself so I was hoping someone knew.Thanks Harv, appreciated.Sorry, I should have added that the network is in preferred networks and that the password should be correct as it was auto-entered (I opened up the screen above, then added a new network by selecting a network I was already connected to)I do not find any hint that CreatePDF handles FrameMaker, but I will have a try with the test account...Thanks, the FAQ does not list it: https://createpdf.acrobat.com/faq.htmlThat little plastic thingy is utterly useless, but I'll accept this as the best answer because it explains the *intended* purpose.Only if you have previously installed 1 app in each iPhone. And non-jailbroken options will only allow them to work with same app on the other side.what do you mean by "point to"? if you mean angry@anywhere point to hacker@elsewhere and this second one is your iphone's, then there's your issue.I have iPhoto on my mac and never purchased it. I always thought it comes along with OS X for free.Great! So others have seen some value in this concept too. Nice to know.Until I have enough rep on this site, I can't comment on other people's posts.  The serversman app is not available worldwide - I am in Canada and it is not in my iTunes app store.Doesn't work for me (Leopard 10.5.8)Hmm, I've done the same thing recently! I think we may have the same problem.Nothing shows up in the console logs when I connect the phone or start iTunes, no.Reinstalling iTunes fixed the problem! Now it syncs and appears in Xcode again.What do you want to do at the cursor?Then why all the fuss about making sure you're got the lastest BootCamp 3.1 before attempting to install Windows 7?I would like to jump to the cursor. Use case being, If I have a long line delimited by space, I would like to jump to a particular location. using the keyboard takes many keystrokes.If you are already using Terminal you probably appreciate the keyboard. Learn the keyboard shortcuts to jump to front/back of line, and navigate by word, and it will save you many keystrokes and probably be faster than the mouse.@g Although dropbox is not meant for photos, I think you'll hardly find anything as good as it for everything else you requested. And its photos interface is good enough.Picasa would be great (because it has great photo sharing features) if it had iPad offline access. But, as you said, with a proper iOS app maybe it becomes better than Dropbox, though it will still not sync as smoothly as big D.It is possible to consolidate them.Sadly, I'm running the most current (stable) Xcode (3.2.5), iOS (4.2), and iTunes (10.1.2). Now downloading the 3.69 jjjigabyte Xcode 4 to see if that helps at all. I wonder if because I built from sample code that wasn't under my app id that it disassociated with my device somehow. Not really sure. If all else fails, I may resort to restoring the whole machine to a last-known good state. (Bah! I just want to get back to coding/testing!)One reason for the continued existence of QuickTime 7, I'd imagine, is to allow the people who bought the Pro licence and/or the QuickTime MPEG2 plugin to continue to use them -- some of those features have no equivalent in the simpler Quicktime X application.Option click, interesting. Never knew that one before. Be sure to click on the line though, holy crap. I don't even understand what's happening when I click above/below the current line. I assume it's pressing up a number of times, but I'm pretty sure the command history isn't exactly matching up.What do you mean by a certificate for the key? Would I have to involve a signing authority?Arrrgghh. There a two versions of the createpdf service: createpdf.adobe.com and createpdf.acrobat.com. The acrobat version does not work (upload does not allow *.fm, point to printer driver but that is wirndows 7 only). But I have uploaded to the adobe site and got the pdf by email!Thanks, I hadn't thought of using a powered hub.  'Fraid I don't have voting privs yet...Yes, or sign one yourself, although I would not recommend that for anything else than personal use.You rock!  That's an awesome answer.  I've seen this question answered before, but nowhere as thoroughly as you've answered it here.  Now I want to find a way to make the yellow button do a "hide" instead of a "minimize".What happens if you suspend/hibernate Windows itself? Is that an option?Now it works. I know I switched back and forth on the route all traffic, but now it works. Thanks for the help.I think it's obvious why you'd want to re-use it. It's nice and small and fits readily onto a keyring.

You can always re-install OS X via a usb dvd drive or dvd sharing if required so there's no problem there.A Linux app that sort-of does what the OP requested. Maybe it can be ported to a jailbroken iPhone. http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/powertop/How is this different than "CPU Time" in top or Activity Monitor (assuming all apps are started at roughly the same wall-clock time)?I don't see a `console.log` file OMM. Where is the file located?@mankoff - CPU time only shows the amount of time consumed by the process. This does not translate into the actual amount of power used by the process.@Nathan - I goofed.  This applies to pre-Snow Leopard versions.  Now there is just system.log as the main system event log.  Apparently, ALS spits out system.log in plain text and stores another version in a binary database format.If there are more networks available, it is possible the Mac doesn't understand to which you want to connect (even though it should follow the priorities given in the preferred networks). Verify the password is the correct one; if you entered one already, remove the network from the list of the preferred networks, and try again to connect. Also, verify the router is not blocking the computer basing on its MAC/IP.Are you using a Mac?+1 I had a very similar experience. Parallels might be slightly faster in certain scenarios, but overall, I think Fusion wins in most cases.It worked! I set up iCal so it's just subscribing to the Google calendars I have, and I have full read/write access.@Arne - That really makes to sense :D In what country are you? Have you tried reinstalling your iOS?Well I know that much, that I can access my Mac OS drive contents from my Bootcamp windows, don't know if it has anything to do with these permissions.Thanks for Quick response. Even with Anti Aliasing OFF, i see around 250 different colors for small block of text. Is there any way to get less unique colors for same block, as On Windows it shows only 2 colors for same block with Anti Aliasing Off. Appreciate your quick responses.@deiga: I am in germany. No, I have not reinstalled iOS, how to?@Cawas it comes with every mac (ie. pre-installed), but not on the install DVDsPlease, move your edit to an answer and accept it :)Great. I'm glad this worked out.You should post the answer here, not a reference to the text in the question. IMHO, you should edit both question and answer and move here the conclusion.Web addresses as home pages are *so* 90s ^^; (though some good landing pages nowadays do exist) I wish there would be something like `about:home` which would translate to the whatever homepage in the whatever browser.you will actually get points for doing that ;)@koiyu I wanted to use `about:blank` (fast), but it didn't work for some reason.The online store just reopened.  However, they don't say anything more than you did.@loic well, I rather use **picasa** anyway! ;-PHaha... I've answered the question but it's saying I can't confirm my answer for two days. Sorry. Still figuring out how things work around here. Awesome site. :DThat isn't an issue on my macbook pro. Even if it's just on battery, it will keep charging the iPhone once I close the lid. Pretty cool! ;)OK, will do. Sorry.@Nathan `open location "http://"` opens `about:blank` (at least with Chrome). But blank isn't quite the same as home page.@Arne - Plug your iPhone to your computer, then in iTunes, on the first page there is a button 'Restore'. Remember that this erases all data from the phone."With this trick, any mounted device will trigger the attached workflow." I only want my SD card to trigger the workflow, or the presence of its directory structure.. can that be done?This doesn't look like it will work. The log in screen pop-ups automatically for web, e-mail, app store, etc. So I'm assuming it wouldn't be redirected to the LastPass browser. And I'm guessing the screen uses Safari which LastPass doesn't work with. Can anyone confirm this?possible duplicate of [Automatically launch a program on a freshly connected USB flash drive](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5988/automatically-launch-a-program-on-a-freshly-connected-usb-flash-drive)@koiyu Doesn't work for Safari. Fills in http://localhost/. True, it isn't a homepage, but it tends to be faster.@Cawas No, it just means that i have an Exchange account at work, and my iPhone is connected to it.kiamlaluno: No, he isn't. He said he's using Internet Explorer 8, which is Windows-only.As it turns out maxing out the memory banks was the way to go. The benefit of more RAM in my case outweighs the triple-channel bandwidth.So does a 'splitter' exist?What battery did your friend lend you? As iPhones don't ave removable batteries..... am confused?!I use TextExpander.@garikapati iphones do have replaceable batteries@Kevin I would say at this stage it's too early. Apple is the first company to my knowledge to introduce this technology to the mainstream.I updated Adobe Flash, and for some days I had to manually set the _User Agent_ string. Today, all in a sudden, I started to see the videos on Youtube even when I left the _User Agent_ string set to the default value ("Automatically Choosen").Wow that really helps, especially because I'm still using a trial version of VMWare. I'll definitely check out Parallels. Thanks!Actually, sometimes I need to change the _User Agent_ string, and sometimes I don't need to do it. I still have to understand I have to change the _User Agent_ string the second time I access Youtube, or if that depends from the video being watched.the Nuvi might be setup to work only with their gear. I hate it when companies do that...True, true. Even more true for RAM. Apple charges (at least in my experience) **ten times more** than others (OWC, Crucial).The ram upgrade to 8gb is not that bad (relative to the above quote); DDR3 1333 for 8gb parts on NewEgg right now runs roughly 100 when you include shipping/tax. Apple wants $200 for the upgrade.I forgot to mention that using safe mode both modules work, but I don't want to keep the computer in safe mode all the time.Are you referring to the 2011 ones?The nuvi is a general issue; only their car charger can tell it that it's not a computer.May need to sudo that.Its a good RSS reader but It automatically refresh only after 30 mins... I need a reader that can refresh after 5 mins@Spiff: D'oh!  Fixed.Do I understand correctly: you can not use "restore device" ("... when the iphone dows not respond as ecpected ...") in iTunes?DisplayLink make USB-graphics adapters supported by OS X. You can connect up to four adapters (and hence monitors) this way.  A bit slower but plenty fast for office work.  http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.phpI can see my flash drive and iPad on the System Profiler, no problem with that.I rebooted several times, still not working.I followed your instructions to repair disk permissions and reset PRAM. Still no luck :(+1 for Ctrl+Shift+Eject... useful if I leave my computer and want to make the screens turn off quickly.Hang on, lemme just call Steve.Sorry, I voted to close this question. This is no the place to speculate on Apple's business strategy. And there's no way somebody will have a definite answer.I have done this before and they are usually pretty helpful, as long as you do it straight away.Yes, that definitely does what I asked for. Unfortunately it doesn't solve my original problem. Emails are excluded, but attachments still show up since they are just documents in the filesystem. Seems like excluding each of the "Attachments" folders is the only way around it. Anyone see other options?@Martin - When I restore (see attempts to fix) in iTunes using an original ipsw of almost any version (haven't tried em all) I get error 23I don't agree that it *doesn't make sense*. You don't want songs to show up in the Artist listing if they have a track on a compilation record? This track doesn't count?Also, If you click on "More" there is an option to view "Compilations". This is equivalent to viewing a "Various Artists" listing. Granted, you can't view by "Album Artist", but this seems minimally useful to me.Remeber that you can set hidden apps to have transparent icons! Just put this into Terminal: `defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES; killall Dock`@deiga: thanks for the tip, I updated the answer.Sorry, I'm an OS X newbie. Could you please elaborate as to how I would create and save this file?Thanks for the info. Is there any way to convert the AppleScript to a service in Automator which takes in no input and prints out the text instead of sending Command-V? I'm trying to do this myself, but I'm getting several bugs in the code.i don't see an answer to my question in thereIf you switch to [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) it'll learn over a short period of time that when you type `utility` and select the second thing from the list that it should show you that thing first. Spotlight doesn't learn like that.@Senseful UpdatedI was able to get it to work by converting the shell script to an Automator Service. I was never able to get the AppleScript to work in the same way.@loic @Cawas there usually is now two DVD's that come with every Mac, the OS install and the Applications install.@Angry it could be some legacy setting that came along with updates. Usually the recommendation is to start a fresh iOS installation, wiping everything. But if iOS really fixed it, I bet there's some way around it.Thank you! Strange that they limit it to only show when you have reached 5 authorizations. I could see that being a problem if a computer were stolen, etc.@jml yes, with every Mac. But when I bought (snow) leopard, it wasn't on them@Ian are you sure? it seems to me that sometimes, Spotlight was learning from my typing.Thanks for your answer, that's just the info I was looking for!I love QuickSilver's Set as Default command.related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2017/is-it-ok-to-charge-my-iphone-with-my-ipad-chargeractually iphone charger can charge an ipad much better than regular USB can. and both do it. but it's true they might not charge fast enough if the iPad is being used.How does OS X decide to apply the Quarantine?I don't have the keyboard for my iPad so I'm not sure if this works, but does *?+Tab* allow app switching analogous to how it works on OSX?Great. Answer. I'll add to it: it's app-dependant but some apps do behave differently when they know they've been hidden. Example: Mailplane close its main window when hidden which cuts its memory and CPU footprint at the cost of a slower un-hide time. I've always thought of "hiding" an application as the OS X equivalent of background'ing it with a lower process priority. It's there, but it's not interactive so the OS doesn't need to give it top priority access to your CPUs to do work.This is great stuff - thank you!  So if I'm getting this correctly, system.log would be all the xnu/Mach/BSD system log data (UNIX subsystem), while console.log is just calls from Objective-C/Cocoa apps ?  Thanks for correcting my acronym...ASL!Thanks!  So based on my comment to @Mark above, the system accounts (running system processes), are from the UNIX layer ?-1 for admonishing the OP. It's not safe to assume they *didn't* check Google first because the same could be said of every question on the SE sites.Command+Down works for me.Change to Album view instead of Artist view?Switched from 3dsmax to it. Its also Autodesk so the you can expect the same, if not better, level of support than 3dsmax.Not completely you can call syslog or the apple asl logging from Cocoa so anything can be in syslogAhh, thanks for the answer. I'm kind of a neat freak, and I hate my Applications stack being cluttered with things I don't use.default's is fine.. my only problem is

mbp:~ alexus$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist

com.apple.tftpd: Already loaded
mbp:~ alexus$@ghoppe Not to split hairs, but I said "makes *more* sense", not "doesn't make sense". In any case that last bit was just my frustration bleeding through. I want songs to show up, but under the Album Artist meta-data instead. Happy to agree to disagree.@ghoppe Didn't know about "Compilations", thanks. Note that a) not all compilations have an album artist of "Various Artists", and b) still a separate list you have to look-up. Drill down by Album Artist to Album the way you can with Track Artist would be very useful to me.@VxJasonxV Yeah, that's what I do now as the Track Artist view is not effective for me. Not ideal though, it's kind of forest and trees. Album Artist->Album is just the way I think.Solve your neat issues by making an /Apps or ~/Applications or something else, and but Aliases or links from there to the few you do use. Then just ignore /Applications.Are you running 10.6 and the Boot Camp 3.1 Update?Not enough info. Size of external monitor? Type (size, compression, etc.) of video?. 2 hours could be reasonable if it is CPU/GPU intensive.After spending hours restoring my iPad and trying every imaginable trick to get Netflix working finding this answer through Google saved the day. Thanks.I will defer to you, deiga, when it comes to Apple's EFI bios emulation. All I know is that my Macbook Pro installed and runs Win7 just fine and I still have OSX installed. My main question is why buy a Apple laptop if you never want to run OSX?It sounds like it's already activated.  Try `sudo launchctl list com.apple.tftpd` and see if it gives you a differently-formatted dum of the .plist (if it's loaded), or an error message (if it's not loaded).  Also, try `sudo lsof -i:tftp` and see if it shows launchd listening on the tftp port (note that launchd will start tftp when it sees incoming traffic on the tftp port).+1 for link and sharing the rationale.Please note that just about anything that you do to open up the case in order to fix this will void your warranty.No wonder I couldn't find it... I was looking for a menu item called "replace".Don't forget that web apps are completely unrestricted.@spiff I considered that, but I'm not certain html5 is ready for prime time.I had a go at this, but unfortunately going through port 3390 didn't work either :(  I tried adding the host name of the windows server to /private/etc/hosts (aliased to 127.0.0.1) to see if I could fool any "look for HOST" mechanism, but no.  What Windows version is this against and what version of Remote Desktop for Mac?Thanks, good info! I take this into consideration, but it would require some reorganization in my account setup. Also having remote access unavailable to "main" user accounts requires some hassling with the folder/permission structure (to easily enable the "main" user's resources for remote use).Yes, it's really buggy - sometimes Ctrl+Alt works and a few seconds later it doesn't work.The problem is that MacBook Air is a laptop and I don't have a *right enter* key.@Ryan No, but I'm about to speak with Belkin about it.with CocnutBattery I can see the battery is at most of its factory capacity (tiny bit lower) ... so at least I know its behaving correctly and doesn't need a new battery.FYI, anyone can embed images. Just use the HTML: <img src="" />@nathan-g Thanks, but I think I need just a little more rep before [that restriction](http://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/new-user) is removed :)Ah, so that's what it's called.  Thanks for giving me the correct Google search term. :)@nathan-g Ah, nm, I leveled up!I already have a DropBox account. Sorry. xDWhat exactly does it download though?@tylermwashburn It downloads an installer. It appears in your dock with a progress bar. When the progress bar fills up, the icon bounces. Click the icon, and it opens an installer much like the 10.6 one found on a disc. You choose the disk/partition to install to, and it chugs away for a half hour.That did it! Thank you, and thank you for experimenting.The question is not answered there, but that doesn't mean that we should have two of them. People will answer the original if they can.The question is does it have some thermal sensor that won't be connected so the fans will always be off or always on.Thanks, the instructions in your first link worked fine.That was is 2009.That's what I was after. Thank you. :)Also, does it come with FaceTime pre-installed, or do you still have to get it from the App Store for a buck?@tylermwashburn It's got FaceTime preinstalled :DYes, the Mac Mini is a few months old and the Macbook is a black 2,1.Now I know to just keep the beta until summer. xDYou can not restore with iTunes and old version of the iOS firmware. You can restore only to the latest one. There are [ways](http://www.saurik.com/id/12) to circumvent this but you should only downgrade/install an old iOS if you have a very good reason to do so. All the latest iOS versions can be [jailbroken](http://greenpois0n.com/).The installation disk coming with a computer is for that model only.Very true, but Samsung is still the largest supplier of SSD. Until I can get in to work tomorrow and ask one of my co-workers for a 100% answer it's the best one I can provide.Thanks everyone for the answers. This was actually the case, I tried the install and before the installer would even start I got a "Mac OS X can't be installed on this computer." Supposedly there are work arounds but they didn't seem worth it; I did more searching and found my Snow Leopard install DVD. http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=590753@macca1, glad you got it sorted out.

Photoshop CS5 showed this dialog: _"The application has been moved, or its path has been changed. To update the product configuration, click Update."_. It seems to work fine though.@chiggsy I watched this question stay unanswered for a few days - and I thought it would be better to contribute what  I could find out in the hope that it would help. If you've got a problem with the answer, submit a better one - it's better to contribute than complain.After using this method for a while, I see two problems: (1) launching the app when Chrome is the default browser always causes Chrome to start up with two tabs (blank tab and google). (2) It doesn't set focus on the browser, instead it causes Finder to remain the focused app.you can restore any version if you hold shift key while clicking on restore button and iTunes will ask for the file .ipsw you want to restore (previously downloaded of course). For the latest iOS, yes they can be jailbroken but at least when I did that, there were no way to restore an iOS above 3.1.2 on an already jailbroken non working iphone.MacRDC 2.0.1, Windows RDC it's been so long I couldn't tell you.

If I hadn't fixed Dropbox to work, I wouldn't have been able to use Lion.Does the 50GB partition show up in Disk Utility or in Boot Camp Assistant?Thank you Martin and Nathan for sharing. I too feared to venture into uncharted territory as I develop apps for a living. I very much appreciate you spending time to share your thoughts. Thank you.When I try to remove from iTunes it says "These apps will also be removed from any iPod, iPhone, or iPad which synchronizes with your itunes library". Obviously, I don't want that to happen.@Justwes I managed to repair it with Disk Utility, but the partition hangs in the middle of the partition when executed form the Boot Camp Assistant.Thanks for the first-hand info! Ordered the scorpio blue now, good to know that it can be solved on a Drive-level and does not require OS hacks.possible duplicate of [Automatically launch a program or action when an external drive or disk is connected](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5988/automatically-launch-a-program-or-action-when-an-external-drive-or-disk-is-connec)I've got a pretty old low spec Mac mini and Sparrow opens so fast I'm not sure whether it'd get the opportunity to bounce in the dock at all anyway.-1 this is [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) and just plain wrong.Now I just need to figure out how I can create a partition without Mac OS X crashing on me. :(To go into a bit more detail (unlike this answer), HTTPS is HTTP over SSL; it uses at least 128-bit keys since the early 90s (e.g. Gmail uses a 128-bit SSL certificate). That means a key is 128 bits long; in other words, there are 2^128 possible keys (340 billion billion billion billion, or a number 39 digits long). It is proven that the only way to break this encryption is by brute force of a key. No system in the world can brute force that many combinations in a reasonable time; it would take literally an eternity with even government hardware. And EFF.org has nothing to do with this.Also, part of the beauty of SSL is that a hacker can record the entire traffic stream, from before the connection even begins to after it ends, when a computer connects to a site it has never connected to before, and that hacker can not reconstruct the original data, nor see anything other than jumbled-up encrypted data. The math is such that even hearing everything going on doesn't give you any advantage. So this absolutely rules out your ISP sniffing HTTPS traffic, and again, even the government doesn't have the power to break the key, even if they filled an entire state with computers.This is happening to me, too, but I just thought it was because my computer was *so fast* (I just got an SSD).I think it's a bug in the new update. I've tried all thre settings for "Show Icon In": "Dock and Menu Bar", "Only in Dock", and "Only in Menu Bar", but the problem persists.And it's not that the app launches that fast on my Mac that I skip seeing the bouncing icon, because it does take some time to launch.that only scrolls a couple lines and does not jump to the bottom of the page tho...I am using the latest iPhoto ('11 I think) and I was afraid it would come up as a negative...Strange.

The OP had a security concern, and Keystone is troubling in its mode of operation. With respect and not malice, I would say your answer made light of a quite valid concern without providing a way to resolve it.  Keystone might be signed, codesign -v would determine if it actually was from a trusted source, although trusted by apple|google != trusted by all. ( Adobe, I am looking at you.)Unless you have a VERY good reason to remove some apps, you're more safe simply moving them elsewhere (out of sight). The space you might gain won't even justify the problems you may get if you remove something that you later need.I've deleted it and everything that had to do with iTerm. I've re-download a new version and the problem is still persisting.Sounds good, but I do not have InDesign.Your original comment means that `localhost:3390` in the RDC window didn't work? And you tried `myhost:3390` (with myhost aliased in the 127.0.0.1 line in hosts file) as well, also to no avail?Also, do you get any output in your terminal window? Channel failures or anything of the sort? Any error messages external to the MacRDC app?Did a restore, but nothing changes - no print buttonThe use of `$PATH:/blah` is safe if `$PATH` is undefined. I would add that back. More likely your reboot solved the problem, not the edit. With the `$PATH` removed from `$PATH:/blah` you may not get `PATH` settings made at the global level propagated to your user environment.Alternatively, you can run the Windows Camera Wizard with the iPad attached and it should recognize it as a camera and ask if you want to import all the pictures off it.

However, I'm not sure what to do after that, since it does not appear anywhere.@Patrick: The general consensus is that only a very small percentage of applications (<10% sticks in my head for some reason) are considered profitable relative to the typical development costs that are typically between $35k-$100k. When divided evenly, apps make approx. $4000 each per Apple's published numbers. But in reality, the majority of the money is being made by the large dev companies (i.e. Electronic Arts) or those being run by former large devs (i.e., Angry Birds). If you want to make solid (consistent) money developing apps your best bet is freelance work, not selling one yourself.@Nathan: thanks, that fixed issue (2)!@Nathan: I just figured out the perfect solution. Please delete your first and last lines, then add the following line at the end: `do shell script "open -a \"" & GetDefaultWebBrowser() & "\""`I've tried both modules separatedly and they work fine, I used also a Linux live CD to test the memory and work as usual (with no changes to the HDD) and it seems the memory are working nice.

This I know from listening to hundreds of devs.@Ben It's the belt clip case from this link (http://www.digitalsondemand.com/p-22-15-item-accessory-bundle-for-apple-ipod-touch-4th-gen.aspx) Digitals on Demand.According to the official specs, the Iphone 4 has a resolution of 960x640. So that can't be it...There are 2 hardware pixels per point on an iPhone 4 (scale = 2.0).  1 hardware pixel per point on a 3GS (scale = 1.0).  But Javascript and css px maps to points, not hardware pixels.MagicPrefs seems to fit the bill; so unless I find some problems after testing it a bit, I'll accept this.@VxJasonxV - Indeed!  No worries.  Hopefully I helped in some way.P.S. I know this question probably won't win me any popularity contests... sorry. :-(OK, can you go into photos, open up a Photo an then open the menu from the leftmost button? Then take a screenshot of this. You take screenshots by keeping the home button pressed and then pressing the power button, the screen should flash.@Ian: it doesn't work with $PATH. I put $PATH in, reboot, fail, remove, reboot, works. Does it work for you with $PATH?Thanks Gordon. I've heard of iDefrag but don't really want to spend the $30.Kevin: I know, it'd be a perfectly reasonable price -- if you were going to use it more than once.  I'l add some ideas to my second option: empty trash, boot from DVD, open Terminal, clear out /Volumes/yourvol/private/var/vm, .../var/tmp, .../var/folders, and .../tmp (but don't delete any of the folders themselves); THEN try shrinking it.I deleted both devices that were paired. I then paired the iPhone and made sure that auto connect was on. Now whenever I turn on the car, it connects to the iPhone automatically after 25 seconds or so. Do you also notice this same delay or does it work immediately for you?Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/447/how-can-i-use-ntfs-partitionspossible duplicate of [How can I use NTFS partitions?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/447/how-can-i-use-ntfs-partitions)This isn't really about computer hardware or softwareThat was it.

Thank you very much!Have you ever used other means to install apps other than your own iPhone and your own iTunes?Pablo: I can't even find a file with that name on my system. Comment was more to say that setting a path with an append or prepend, blindly, is safe (at least in  shells).Doesn't really answer your question, but don't forget you can move the dock to the side of your screen, rather than leave it at the bottom. This makes much better use of the screen real estate on most widescreen laptops, IMHO.

Note also that you don't need to use a shortcut to re-show the dock when it's hidden, you just need to move your mouse over it.possible duplicate of [External drive format to be writeable on both Mac and Windows](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9329/external-drive-format-to-be-writeable-on-both-mac-and-windows)Fair enough, good explanation.@Cawas : I never did+1 Think Photoshop is tool to do almost anything to an image. Aperture/Lightroom are more libraries to store your images and perform certain corrections to them, but neither have "layers" and all the tools that make Photoshop the "most complete" (yet annoying in a lot of aspects) tool for digital image editing. You can configure Aperture to call photoshop at any time (it will generate a new version of the image to preserve the previous).One thing you haven't mention is what type of Internet Connection do you have and how do you connect to it? Airport? Ethernet? I know you've tried from another system, but I assume that the other system is using the same connection type/ISP. Could you please elaborate on that?It happens to me on a Mac Pro with 8 cores and 10GB RAM, but it usually goes away when you just switch to the finder back and forth another app, since the new app must refresh the bar.Step 1 was the first thing done, didn't work.  Not sure how to do step 2.I've seen the "$@" command but wasn't sure how to use it. I simply put "cd $@" at the beginning of my script and it solved the problem. Thanks for your help.I've never actually tested the pairing time. I have never had a case (so far) where I have started the car and immediately tried to dial out. Glad you were able to make it work.I tried this, and it worked. In all browsers. Which is great, thank you. But I'd still like to know why my Open with/Save File dialog has decided to stop working (in all browsers!!!) as I don't want to have to remember to option click on links every time the destination is a file. Plus, clicking on a link from an email or IM still fails.Made me think that my Downloads folder is corrupt or something, but when I told my browsers to save files elsewhere (eg the Desktop) then the problem didn't go away.Nope, it seems arbitrary as far as I can tell. Right-click-save-as is no good to me if I'm following a link to a .zip file from an email or IM.No proxies set. In my DNS tab the DNS server is not editable (I think it's set to the IP address of my router). I haven't changed this in a long time; this issue has only popped up in the last couple of weeks.I took a look at the Header Response in the Net tab in Firebug, and it says this: Failed to load source for: http://www.1001freefonts.com/font/BaroqueScript.zip (not sure if that helps?)If using launchd, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-to-run-something-automatically-when-the-system-boots-or-a-use-logs-onLingon also is now on the App StoreThanks for the hints. Unfortunately I had tried these steps already to no avail.Did you ever solve this?

I am having the same problem, only with apps. I had to bypass my home network to get it to work so, I agree, it must be a port blocking issue int he router.

Just wondering if you found the ports that are being used?@Ian: You have to create the file if it doesn't exist. There's a nice tool for it: http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/environmentvariablepreferencepane.html   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5053022/how-do-i-change-path-for-rubymine-system-wide   Note that it isn't a shell config file, it's a plist and it seems to work differently.This answer is confusing. According to another answer, no, developers don't get the report, only apple does; unless they are using the app store.Check out also [Photography stack site](http://photo.stackexchange.com/) and its [apple-aperture tagged questions](http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-aperture?sort=votes). And like you thought: it makes more sense to compare Aperture to Lightroom than either one to Photoshop.Your comment `I had an old router that did this occasionally`, I think you may be right y'know.  The reason I re-installed my OS was because my interwebs was not only going super slow but it also images downloaded would just look corrupt.  This happened on my iPhone too.So I tried the 10.6.1 update literally 10 times, on the tenth time it worked fine.  This suggests to me that downloads are becoming corrupt.  New router time methinks!Wireless, standard ADSL.  Yes, the other system was using the same connection.  I'm now downloading the updates from work instead.  If these work, then I know it's something to do with my router (which could very well be the case).  I honestly hadn't thought of that until suggestions by yourself and one other on here.@Daniel, probably my view are biased since I come from Computer Science, but I rarely saw papers that didn't look like they were written using TeX. In my department it's recommended for every academic writing.Generally, if the only solution you can find is a jailbreak solution, it's the only solution. As hotpaw2 said (accept that answer), the sandbox nature of stock iOS disallows anything like this. You can control a Mac or PC from an iOS device, but not the other way around.No, in my OS X 10.6.6 didn't work like this :(do tell us what sort of Wireless modem you have/router/Etc. and we'll start from there ;)I decided to take the cheapest 13". Going to buy it today or tomorrow. :)I suggest you don't use Crontab and instead learn to use Launchd as already suggested.It works nice. Thanks.that's a very interesting approach. thanks for your workflow. I assume for travelling, you do the aperture processing -> copy final to iPhoto ?thanks for pointing out the issues with keeping 2 apps in sync.I'll let you know when I get home ;)I'd try some more debugging before replacing the router.  For example, is your router separate from the ADSL modem?  If so, I'd try connecting the Mac straight to the modem, and see if that works.  I've also had ISPs that actually tamper with the data in HTTP connections -- bloody annoying.Isn't it complicated?Thanks!  Appreciate the adviceAlthough you're at the command line, I think the answer here is actually Mac-specific and not Unix/Linux related. That's because I think you probably want to use Growl and `grownlnotify`.That isn't a build in command, at least on my box.almost exact duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1927/how-do-you-sync-an-iphone-to-multiple-computers-without-erasing-all-the-applicatirefraining what I said previously, I don't know for how long there are oficial ways to sync iOS to multiple iTunes: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9350/itunes-library-sync-between-two-computers/9352#9352http://growl.info/ Growl is the program referred to by @mattdm.I just tried the keyboard viewer, (thanks for the tip!)  It shows the delete key being pushed.  So at some level it's a live key.Actually, the backspace key shows a left-delete glyph (block arrow pointing left) and the delete key shows a right-delete glyph (block arrow pointing right)Interesting that you like the Mac for the window management! I'm the exact opposite - on Linux my window management is insanely great (FVWM2) while the Mac is terrible. I suppose that speaks to someone else's earlier comment that much of it is personal preference.I use nearly this exact approach but I extend Growl with [Prowl](http://www.prowlapp.com/) so that Growl can push the notification to my iPhone.Apologies. I didn't realise you were planning to self answer.@Diago: yours is good too. I'll accept it.Agreed. My only reason for preferring HyperDock is cost and features, especially if you come from Windows 7Any particular reason you deleted my inclusion of additional information?@Diago - I just rolled it back to your version, as it provides more information.My take on Sorens' comment above is that the iOS products (iPhones, iPads, iPod Touch) are now all clearly on a 12 month revision cycle. So waiting 6-8 months for the problems to shake out (and I'd argue that there haven't been significant problems, on, say, the iPad) means that you're letting most of the product lifecycle go by. My strategy (got my first Mac in 1984) is to instead buy stuff when it's announced. If they offer three different levels of the product (Good, Better, Best) I tend to buy the Better level.@Kyle Cronin: Technical terms here might yield a better answer. So would you mind changing the words "by ID" in the question to "using a code point"? You'll see much written about Unicode being misunderstood in the computing world, and I'd like to be careful not to spread any misinformation or introduce ambiguous terminology in an already complex subject! Thank you :)I have the same problem - just updated to flash 10.2 and voila - black box in you tube!
Works ok in firefox - must be a safari-flash issue ?Ok, so I put the SD card in and iPhoto popped up and said loading photos, like it was reading the card. Then, that message popped up saying that it wasn't ejected properly and the icon disappeared from the desktop. I left the card in and went to disk utility, but the SD card was not listed on the left. Any other suggestions? Thanks for your help!This may be a stupid question, but what is a USB card reader?i guess i always thought the return key as being an "enter" key, as "enter a door" or "enter at your own risk".  I think it's odd that the company that can't stray away from a one button mouse makes us use two buttons to open a file on the keyboard. Seems kind of flawed logic to me.@compulsionstar - FYI, it's been several years since Apple last shipped a one button mouse.I fear you might have to wait until later next week until someone can actually try this :-)Double-clicking actually zooms instead of maximizing.  Lowering isn't that useful IMO, hide can be used instead.Lol: tell app "System Events" to count windows of processesThe user posted the same question at [superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/250794/assigning-caps-lock-key-for-contextual-menu-right-click-on-os-x). (No solution there either at the moment...)@Dori Thank youYou can also tap on Copy to copy the images to the clipboard and paste them into the email. You can do this to get around the 5 image limit.Snapz Pro X has been my go-to program for still screen captures since dinosaurs ruled the Earth; it's great for that. It's not optimal for recording video of the screen, however. It requires a very lengthy rendering step after the capture is done. I found that long wait really hinders my workflow, which is why I switched to Screenflow for video recording. Screenflow also has extensive editing capabilities to polish the recording.I do not have installed ClickToFlash.Any reason why they don't tell us about RAM? Their specs page has everything but the RAM, bit strange.Could be all marketing and content control. It sounds like something they did not want consumers comparing against other products/competitors...it really cannot be used as a valid indicator for purchase in the same way as a laptop. If I saw it up there in the specifications, I would think that they would have definitely played that out in the Keynote.VLC is no longer on the App StoreI rephrased your question, also, if you want to ask a question about Cydia, please ask another separate question (after searching if it wasn't already asked)Plus the motto of jailbreaking is exactly what you requested: "take control of your iOS". And [it's not illegal](http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20011824-85.html) for quite some time now.Magic mouse is technically one button...I think they don't tell you because they want it to be an appliance. You don't know how much RAM is in your fridge or DVD player and I think Apple want the iPad to be be the same. Plus of course the iPad is magic, and nothing magical has RAM in it.If Flash had crashed he would have seen the crash dialog.May I ask which LaCie drive you have? I've heard quite a lot about LaCie and how Mac users like using them (With me being one of them), but I was dissuaded by the high costs of it so I used Western Digital instead. Do you like the drive?I downloaded the files at work, then tested them at home and it worked fine.  Re-downloaded them at home and it failed.  It's either my router or my microfilter.  Both of which I have spares and will test tonight.And the Kindle is an _awesome_ device to read from too.Yup, I tried that too. (with "http://google.com" instead of "Google Chrome.app") Both version don't work.@Leslie a card reader that you connect via USB rather than one build into the computer.This is not what he asked, it's definitely not "quick" nor "automated" nor "one-click".On an unrelated note, if you want this to have all your passwords organized and be able to automatically fill forms with user/pass/data/creditcards/Etc. in a secure way, I'd suggest you try 1password:  (i don't work for them) http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword@Martin: I am a happy 1Password customer. ;)I don't know which type it was. I bought it 2008 and it had a 500Gig SATA drive in it. The main reason it's used by Mac people is probably the design. The disk controller died last week and altoghether the disk wasn't particularly great. It was loud as hell. Stay with WD, they make good drives from my experience.Do you know of such app?Thank you. I'd installed LispWorks but I'll take a look at others as well.-1728 can be a lot of things, but it typically comes up when a string has a character it doesn't understand (like a character that should be escaped), but it could also simply be the key chain "lorin" doesn't exist and another value is required (I don't have a keychain on my Mac that has my user name). I only offered the above as an example, but it is dated from 2002, so you're going to have to do some tweaking on your end to make it work in something up-to-date and particular to your needs.OK, so I paste that into the AppleScript editor and I get: 'error "System Events got an error: Access for assistive devices is disabled."' How do I enable it? For applications that I've installed previously that needed this, the app itself prompts me. "Enable access for assistive devices" is enabled in my system preferences.Too bad there are no Apple Stores in the Netherlands. :(Good point. Netherlands. Check.+1 for the command line. Those are typically much more streamlined and optimized ways of doing things. It can even be included in an Applescript with `do shell script`Thanks, but I imagine that Verizon is specific to the USA only. I am not in the USA so that doesn't apply to me. Can't I use the usual tethering via Bluetooth that I have been using with my laptop?You seem to be assuming that I am in the USA, which I am not. AT&T / Verizon is meaningless to me. :-)Well, I have been using my iPhone (definitely running iOS) to get to the Internet from my laptop va tethering. What do you mean by "iOS doesn't support getting internet via tethering"? Of course it does!Indeed, a users keychain is called login.keychain and not username.keychain (unless changed).@Dori: Thanks for retagging my question, but I don't think this is about iOS 4.3 specifically. My iPhone is not running iOS 4.3, and the iPad that I am planning to buy might not run iOS 4.3 if I decide to get a second-hand original iPad.@cesargon The 4.3 iOS software, when available, will be rolled out worldwide, so it should work with your local phone provider. That provider will have its own policies on charging (or not) for the Personal Hotspot feature. Tethering via Bluetooth will still work.@CesarGon I think Mr Alpha was referring to your iPad - it doesn't have the ability to access the internet via bluetooth. However, as others have said, the iOS 4.3 update will update the tethering feature on your iPhone 4 to enable wifi tethering, which your iPad can use.I edited my answer with a couple examples. I can't vouch for either, since I don't have an iPad.I own Navigon, and I think it is terrific. Way better than my old Garmin and Magellan stand-alone units. Note that the software is now at list price; they have previously had deep-discounted sale prices.Thanks for the info, Negrino. I wasn't sure if that was the normal price or not, so I didn't want to comment on that.Just keep in mind that when you click on this script, you wont have the chance to save any unsaved work from any application. The system WILL reboot your machine whatever the cost!@looris sometimes there's no need to re-invent the wheel..Damn, you beat me only by a few minutes (while I was still typing)! I still posted my answer since it goes a bit more into detail, but you just received +1 from me :-)I did the same thing and got the cheapest as my first mac and upgraded the ram to 8Gb.  It's actually faster than my Windows 7 desktop with an overclocked quad core.I use OmniPlan and really like it.Thanks, worked a charm! (Though I'm not a fan of the fact that you need to install a 252 MB package to be able to do this.) I'm accepting this answer because of the (very helpful) extra details you provided.The hacking gods are working on it.I didn't quite parse your first sentence.  "On Mac keyboards the same key and key code is used for forward delete (?)."   Which two things are the same?  As I added above, I really want the key marked 'delete' on the key cap to do the same thing that ?? (cmd bckspc) does.went to manufacture's website they only have for OS9, and Vista, not even for W7, and I thought I'm going go with "big" brand name like Belkin to make sure everything is "ok"... go figure...I thought OpenProj was the answer to my Gantt needs, but the behaviour is just so quirky that i gave up.That quote is actually out of date. The terms were changed in the last few months to allow interpreted (not compiled) code to run, so long as it doesn't download any. But of course, [citation needed] and I haven't found it yet.Actually, I really just need to control my own App, for testing purposes. I'll comment below.Thanks! I should clarify - I do want to control my Own App mostly, for automatic testing purposes. 
So how do I do that? What is needed on iOS and on PC/Mac?Ok, that's a start. Now I need to monthly reset the statistics. So I need an app for that...I'll check with my carrier (Vodafone) like you suggested. Thanks@Jonik you could also set up the Dock the way you want and then put the com.apple.dock.plist into `/System/Library/User\ Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences`, but this will need a lot of `sudo`-ing and setting up right permissions to get it to work, and additionally will then be the standard Dock for *every* newly created user.Ah, interesting to know. Thanks for that too!@MikeyByCrikey - But I *DO* know how much RAM my fridge and DVD player have, and I incorporate such information into the decision making process when deciding to buy products.@MikeyByCrikey - Also, "Magic" just means no one has figured out how it works, and is a detrimental shortcut to critical thinking. I'd argue that it is actually a pejorative term.I did end up buying a Microsim cutter but this also works.Yea the password isn't the same as the lock code and on another note, she needs a better pass code! If you have contacts and pictures synced she could just setup as a fresh phone?I'm on Vodafone. They probably do have this info somewhere....Try logging onto your mobile account or searching the appstore for MyVodaphone. I haven't used it myself but it's there...A great suggestion. 1Password can utilize DropBox if you have it installed to keep a 2nd or 3rd or nth Macintosh update with your passwords and secure information. AND, if you have an iPhone/iPad, there are iPhone/iPad clients which also sync over DropBox so you can really have 1 secure place for passwords/information which is accessed via all of your devices (supports Windows and Linux too, but no here would care about those platforms :)Thanks Negrino, I usually try to follow the same idea myself.This is a proof, which I want! thxYeah I bought Navigon back in December when it was on sale simply because it runs native on both iPhone and iPad.Thanks a lot! So basically what you're saying is that A-GPS becomes just GPS? Do you have any reference for that or is it from personal experience?Ten? More like 20+ years old.@Kyle Cronin: Oh, I see. If you rewrite your comment as an answer, I will accept it. :-)It does allow you to combine rules, which is what I thought might help but in retrospect, I think you are right and the fact that it requires a keystroke is probably a deal breaker.I second OmniPlan. Latest update works with 2007 and 2010 Project files, no one at work even notices that I work in another program. Omnigroup builds solid apps and they are working on an iPad version.The method you suggest should work fine -- start dragging, switch applications using keyboard, stop dragging.

For Mail.app, there's a built-in service called "New email with attachment", that you can access by right-clicking any file in the Finder. If Entourage supports Automator workflows, you could probably write a similar Service for Entourage using Automator.I agree with you that the side is better for widescreens, that's what I'm using when I have to let the dock displace my windows. FYI I've googled some more on this, and I really can't find any solution...I'm interested in the issue. Could you also post detail on this. What bug is it and what problem does it imply in NetBeans? Thx.@CesarGon You can just accept Negrino's answer, it says the same thing.Yep, that's what I'm trying to get at. I'm drawing from multiple sources (I don't have an iPad). I've edited the sources into my answer.Target also will get the iPad on the same day of Walmart i.e. March 11From notes section: iPod shuffle and iPhone are intended for use with a single computer. You cannot load music from multiple computers or iTunes libraries onto iPod shuffle and iPhone like you can with other devices.Oh, and one other item to try is to clear the cache files on those browsers. Most browsers have a way of clearing out their cached data from within their application (menu item or preferences).Huh... Oddly enough, after posting this, I was able to get Audio Hijack to record the incoming audio. Unfortunately, this also seems to mute my outgoing audio, making everything still pretty useless. I'll check out that cable.Please provide more information about your OS X version.Exactly.  And then I archive off the traveling aperture library to a few external hard drives as backup.After making it the default, then you use `open file.txt`.Thanks, the .local worked.  nmblookup found it as well.Uh, that application appears to be currently free already.Duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7345/does-the-use-of-ssd-give-one-a-dramatic-performance-boostI also use Reeder.

Really fast. Was using Byline before I've found Reeder.I'm about 30mins drive from the nearest one.There are a few, Alfred, Dropbox, NowPlaying, Live Mesh, GMail Notifier. I guess I'll try disabling one at a time to see if anything works there.If you have been regularly syncing your iPad to your Mac/Windows computer via iTunes, then you should have recent backups from which you can restore when you purchase a new iPad. So, you should be good to go to buy that new iPad. Good luck!Mac OS X 10.6.6I second this.  1Password is likely one of the most useful applications I've run across in recent years.Yup. Was highlighted blue.Ha! I was just about to ask that. I updated all my icons with new ones but I was unable to update the Time Machine drive icon because of a lack of permissions. Glad you figured it out.Great suggestion, I hadn't tried that. Unfortunately, yes, the problem exists in other user accounts too :(Plenty of gigabytes of disk space left. As I mentioned in another comment, I can option-click to download files, which works fine. But links from emails and IM etc do nothing. Problem exists for other user accounts too :(It might be worth resetting the system Launch Services registry; according to [this](http://ss64.com/osx/lsregister.html), you can do it with `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user` (or download [Onyx](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/onyx.html) and have it do the reset).thanks, great answeruse `'*.mp3'` (single quotes) or you can have troublesYou can leave out the path to the application completely, as `open` consults the LaunchServices DB.

This one has always been a pain.. I always pray that people don't need to use Serial port much these days.. Hoping to see some good discussion on this one..When you typed `Album` my mind thought `Song`, sorry. I haven't purchased an Album in a long time. So this might not work for you. You could try changing "by random" to "by album" and see what that does. I don't have a way to test that since I don't any albums. I post example values (0 days, 25 items). You should play with those values to achieve your desired affect.Thanks! Just downloaded it and it looks almost perfect!Thanks for the suggestion!@IntutionHQ Thanks!

Sorry, not trying to cause problems with your good +11 answer here, just trying to make a single reference place for all WM questions.@Kyle Cronin: OK, thanks.Thank you for the clarification. I read theh article that you mention but I am still not sure if I need to be in a WiFi area to use the Personal Hotspot feature, or the iPhone will act as a WiFi access point for me.@mankoff I'm not worried about my answer, I'm just saying that this question shouldn't be closed as a "duplicate" of a newer question.Thanks Kris - this workedYeah this is pretty much what I do now, would be nice if there was a better wayThanks, LW, kind of you to tell me what I should but didn't know. (My first time here -- Apple Discussions didn't do me much good, guess the question was too dumb!)Thanks, FN, really helpful -- I'm about to change my ways!Thanks, GD, clearly I've been worrying way too much -- I look forward to not!  To me, it's surprising that folk would even think of doing the unwise things you mention, but then I've been way too timid.Thanks, LW, kind of you to tell me what I should but didn't know. (My first time here -- Apple Discussions didn't do me much good, guess the question was too dumb!) So I'll certainly change my habits.I agree it shouldn't actually be closed, but it is still a duplicate. Time is irrelevant, they are each duplicates of each other and should reference each other. I was just trying to follow the last paragraph of this post: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/Two things I'm look for are: 1) not having one extra attachment every time I move the laptop from work to home. 2) Better quality audio.  I hadn't thought about your suggestion, but it gets me #2, and it's better than what I'm doing now!  But I'll still buy a MDP -> MDP+Audio cable if anyone makes one.While this is what you did, it doesn't actually answer the question you posted. You should accept one of the answers to the question *as you asked it*.You can't really do that, but good news is that OS X's new version, Lion, seems to have a wider result pane. Of course, as everything Lion related, it's subject to change. For an alternative, you can always try http://frovil.com/spotlaser.html but it's probably not what you're looking for.That is an interesting solution although The question was not how to make the computer say Time To leave; I want to know how to pipe output from one program to `say`. Thanks for the response though.Did you convert them to some other image format using an image program or did you just change the extension? Changing the extension won't turn a JPEG into a PNG. You need an image program to convert it and then you can change the extension. I am not sure about your thumbnail issue, but I wanted to clarify at least that.Although this solves the installation problem, I still can't run autocad due to "whip" failed to initialize errorI was merely renaming the extensions so the thumbnails would not show. Now they are all of the form "123.info", but some still show thumbnails and even open as if they were still .jpeg files. But strangely some appropriately don't, as they shouldn't.Based off of very initial analysis, I don't think you'll be able to, because `leave` forks/daemonizes and leaves your shell.Would you accept details of another AV solution? Or are you set with ClamXav?Although this answer is useful, it does not meet the need completely. This solution will not work when trying to attach while forwarding/replying to an email. Thanks.I think [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/) might have a chance at working here, but I'm having trouble finding the best way to test it to be sure.So you can't pipe output from daemons to another program?You can probably capture the output of daemons and pipe it to another program, but not as simply as `|`I tried this, and it also lead me to running Verify in Disk Utility and then Repair using DiskWarrior. Nothing has fixed it. I'm thinking my alternatives are a reinstall or to just resign myself to using Folx all the time. :(`STDERR` or some other message mechanism? Why would it do that. Another commenter seems to think the issue is that `leave` is a daemon. What is that last command you wrote? `cmd 2>&1 |cmd2`The last command pipes STDOUT and STDERR through the pipe. Normally only STDOUT gets captured, and STDERR goes wherever the first command would send it. Why would `leave` do that (whatever "that" is)? Because the authors wrote it that way.Does it have to do with permissions? Have you checked that?I used that command to pipe `STDERR` from `leave` to `say` and it almost worked. Basically, all of the output was sent at one time rather than in increments.Yep, I have OmniGraffle but it is quite time intensive to create a timeline. (I was using OmniGraffle actually to create a timeline recently for a mini-project before.)What I'm looking for, however, is an application that can create a event timeline... for example, one that would be used in History classes. (Dates, figures, ...)hm... I think the assumption nowadays is people don't read manual -- when was the last time you read a manual on Chrome?  On Safari?  Or let's put it this way -- of the items you use, what's the percentage of manual you read?  5%, 10%?  Even if it is more, that means there is a good chance that the manual is not read by the user.Unfortunately, recently started to display unremovable promoted tweets. And that can't be disabled.Interesting, not clear how this would work with a local app expecting to 'find' a serial port on the computer, however...?Thanx! Didn't know that in the mail.app there was a growl tab where I could configure the notificationsYeah I can see the url quite plainly. I guess I was wondering whether there is a formal protocol for logging into a system like this. But the other thing you made me think of is I could write a Safari extension to do the automatic login. However, if the first thing I want to do is run my mail client or anything non-browser based it will simply fail until I go to Safari and do this login. Which is annoying.Thanks for the idea - not sure I am getting how Fluid would help though.Duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9451/do-new-macs-get-free-upgrades-to-10-7@Marplesoft If you see the URL that logs you in, you can bookmark it. Just open that page to log in. However, if you see a normal URL (without the ?name=fred&pword=qwerty), you'll have to type it in manually.Oh I see what you're saying. But yeah I think it's a form POST, not just URL query string that passes the userid/password.@JFW: that's good info. I'd recommend the OmniGroup's other product for that: [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/). It's like Visio for Mac and I've drawn history-class type timelines (for s/w planning) with it.Thank you! I followed your instructions and solved the problem.The app file is located in a system folder so that it could not be found by Spotlight. But thanks anyway =)Its possible that Lion may be cheaper, WIth its tight integration into the Mac App store, apple are going to want people to upgrade so that they can get buying apps. Currently there isn't that much advantage of using the app store.Why the down vote, this answer is perfectly correct@Marplesoft If it's a post request, I don't believe you can automate it.He's looking for a hardware player. He knows iTunes plays the file already.A PS3 is a heckuva media player.yeah, I was being stupid. This answer doesn't answer his question.What application are you using to view the resource fork?thanks a lot! I saw the steady white power light.Do you hear a boot chime? Even with nothing connected, except the power cable, if you push the Power button in the back you should hear the Macintosh boot chime. If you hear the boot chime, then try a different monitor if you have one. If you don't hear a boot chime, then the mac is having trouble.And i am sure that I am using the right input on my monitor. I googled a bit, and found out mini has a DVI-I port, but my dell monitor comes with a DVI-D cable. My qauestion is, can I use this cable? As I understood, I can.@Orunner You cannot plug a DVI-D cable into a DVI-I port; they are different. Take a look at this photo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DVI_Connector_Types.svg You need an adapter.Thanks sorens! I heard the sound. It seems to boot. But I really cannot tell if it is booting or not. Unfortunately, I do not have a second monitor at hand. What can I still do?Thanks Nathan! I read some articles. As far I understood, DVI-I is kinda "universal" which is compatible with both DVI-D (digital) and DVI-A (analog). I evened checked my graphic card, the output port seems to be also a DVI-I. Strange, I am totally confused.@Orunner My understanding is that DVI-I will work with DVI-D *if you use an adapter*. In other words, the video signal is universal, but you need a different connector.@Sorens You don't hear the sound if the volume is down or the speakers are broken, so it's not a guaranteed test.thanks guys. I will try it with my work Pc at work. I'll let you know.@VxJasonxV: If the solution is better than ClamXav, it would be useful to know about it.No problem. Glad to help.I've tried downloading iBooks to my iPod touch, but it says that it's no longer available to download...The iTunes store says it will work on any iPod touch running iOS 4 or later. It works fine on mine.@Nathan G., I will grant you the broken speaker condition. However with Macs that have a working internal speaker, muted volume does not abate the boot chime noise, nor does plugging in head phones. Perhaps this is not true of all Macs. I can only speak from experience with Macbooks, Macbook Pros, Mac Minis and Mac Desktops. Speaking from experience -- I have accidentally woken up children in adjoining runs when I tried to quietly reboot a mac in the middle of the night.@Sorens Muting the volume blocks the startup chime on both my iMac and MacBook.Does restarting the Finder work?I don't have just a reader, but I tried leaving it in my camera and attaching the camera to my computer, but that wasn't working either...Apps like GoodReader have the capabilities to connect to FTP, iDisk, DropBox, and WebDAV servers and download content to the device.  Once its there, as long as there is an app capable of opening it, it should open accordingly.@peelman True, that's what I meant by "what's possible is closely tied to the applications". Unfortunately, none of the options you mention help Jason.that sucks, doesnt seem like the ipad fits me, maybe the samsung tab  or is it the same on it?@Jason We don't provide product or shopping recommendations. In fact, your original question can be considered off topic for this site, as it relates to an electronic device, not a computer. Please do your own research.@Daniel might not help Jason, but it may give a lead to anybody else who happens upon the question :)@Daniel Beck, err... NO? The apple website does not tell you anything about if you are a advanced computer user the ipad would feel like a toy for a 3 year old@Jason What are you referring to in your comment? And why do you think they should tell you what it *doesn't* do?UPDATE: Want to add that there is another company coming out with iPad-to-display wireless connector besides Blaze,  one that will purportedly be released this month: CyWee Air Shuttle http://www.cywee.com or http://www.mirrorop.com/Most random comment ever: I have a similar problem if I use my MacBook's trackpad if I have a tiny bit of banana residue on my fingers. Connection? Probably not. But I couldn't help sharing...I used to run vim on a 266 MHz G3.  The MBA 11 is loads faster.I'm talking about delays of up to a 1 second to switch windows in Gnu Screen and redraw. It's a pretty serious delay, by any standard, I think.I find sometimes if I've been playing games on my iPhone for a while their starts to be an increase in resistance; also not sure how to solve this. I find wiping the screen helps, but guess this is different from being cold...I bought the B&W P5 when they were on sale on the Apple store and do not regret it. They sound amazing, look amazing, and so far have been very durable. One of my fave tech purchases ever.In that case, if it's explicitly designed to physically communicate, then no, I don't believe this satisfies your goal.They look great, but they are open-backed, so will leak a fair amount of sound.What's the shipping estimate/tracking say? That would give you a clue as to the method used. My guess is air.That worked perfectly; thanks!Are you sure it's being shipped from Shanghai? I would imagine that Apple must have at least *one* distribution point in Canada, somewhere. They will probably ship it from there.Voting to close. This really isn't relevant to the scope of the site and there is no conclusive way to answer it.I would through another set of headphones into the pix, the Bose Quiet Comfort 3 headphones. They are $349 at Amazon.I would start with Live Mesh first to see if that is doing it. Dropbox and GMail Notifier are widely used and unlikely to have caused it.What's your question?this is exactly what I needed, thanks!@john, the QuietComfort 15s look better than the QC3 (and $50 less) -- any reason for recommending them over QC15?thanks. I'll actually be using them at work, so the attenuation of outside noise is definitely a feature for me. I have a pair of Sennheiser HD600 that I use at home. They have an open design, and I have definitely been told by other people that they can hear what I'm listening to. Maybe I _should_ turn the volume down...Thanks best shown by upvote & accepting answer.I've read some reviews on Amazon that suggest these break easily, and that Bose isn't great about fixing them under warranty. Do they feel durable and solid to you?I *think* it does, so it a good option to know about.Individual files can still set a flag to show their file extension. This is more like "Always show filename extensions" vs. "Respect the individual file's preference". (I think the OP is looking for "Disregard individual files' preferences and never show filename extensions.")..are you aware that you can send the content of any HTML-website by pressing cmd+i in Safari? This way you could generate documents just like you would any other HTML and then send them as e-Mails.Do you have examples of the images in question? There could be several reasons for this.@Philip: see my update please.Isn't Xresources only for X? This sounds like a purely command line task.Good question. I thought colour settings would propagate if the remote login device said it was type *xterm* but I'm trying it now and it's not working. Edited the answer and thanks for pointing that out. OP: if you can do X forwarding you can launch an Xterm on the remote machine that's coloured to indicate it's a root Xterm session using the `.Xresources` approach.Thanks, but is it the screenshots or the diagrams and illustrations that can't be viewed?This has been an annoyance since at least iPhone OS 2.0. It would be nice if the title scrolled like it did on iPods as far back as I can remember.Sad that there doesn't exist a solution for this problem, I will for now mark your response as answer. (Hopefully some superhero will create an app which makes it possible to change the shading colors of ical)But disabling the service will not reset the configurations and I ned to do a full reset of the Update ServerSad that there isn't a genius out there which can make an add-on which makes this configurations possible. I will mark your response for now as an answer.I tried QRGen but it didn't manage to resolve the QR Codes which I uploaded. But I think your answer is still acceptable as there could be quality issues with the QR Codes I took pictures off ;)It's used by a whole lot more than just that.OK, so `tell application "System Events" to get UI elements enabled` returns `true`, but the error above still happens, even with adding the enabler line you suggest to the beginning.@Lri, that opinion is fine, but in *my* opinion lowering *is* incredibly useful - one of the most important of the above requirements.having the same behavior on my Mac and my Linux box is the point, so doing it with modifier keys is important.Interesting, but does an iOS user have access to the PDFs stored in iBooks, if those are even PDFs? (They could be ePub. Then what?)@Jason Sundram I've broken a set. It was after several years of use and obviously after the warranty was up. It was my fault. I had the head phones buried in a backpack and I yanked them up by one ear and of course the other ear caught on something and I snapped it right off at the swivel hinge. I contacted Bose and I was able to replace them at a slight discount by shipping them my broken ones. So I am on pair number 2 in about 6 years. I am more careful when I travel with them now. I think they are relatively sturdy so long as you don't abuse them and you use the included case if you travel.Have you tried QR Reader as well? Might work better. I've tried QRGen with pictures taken on my iPhone 4 and it worked 4 times in a row. Maybe you are right about the resolution issues. Hope you can get it worked out. Cheers.@Philip: I strongly thing that the implied question was obvious, but since you insist I add it explicitly...It comes from trying to compile via Weblogic's ejbc compiler. I kept getting java.io.IOException: error=7, Argument list too long. I found [this](http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=183372).@Lo'oris: Without the question, it just reads like someone complaining, and those types of questions have been closed in the past here and on other sites. It could be worse: I could have just voted to close and not say anything at all.Where did you store folder with its support files?There is kind of an easier way on iOS, but not on iPad 1, and it needs preparation. 

One side needs an iOS device with a camera, with the app RedLaser (or other QR code reading app). The other side needs an iOS device with this bookmarklet installed in Safari: http://code.google.com/p/qrbookmarklet/ 

Then the person reading the interesting article clicks the bookmark and a QR code of the URL pops up, and the other person scans the QR code in RedLaser which opens Safari with to that page.

Two touches for the person with the article, three for the other, no email.Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1912/is-there-any-way-to-view-full-podcast-title-on-iphone/You can't put newlines in comments.

I was hoping there was a way to use that info to modify the text.Well **Not able** Isn't techically correct. 1. Just because you can do something as root does not mean that you should. 2. I'm not the only one working on these servers and perhaps they *dont* care for the same colors I do. 3. If I do it once in iTerm I don't have to do it for each of the 25+ servers I work on.Didn't even try to answer the OP's question.Excellent thank you. I saw the folder, it was empty and it didn't cross my mind to look for hidden files.quitting the Finder will also disable the desktop :-(The above example already exceeds it (Album: "Beethoven: The Complete String Quartetts" Track: "String Quartett #3 in D Op. 18/3 - 1.

In classic land there is a lot like that.Have you tried this - doesn't Apple check the country - it does for UK banks.That sounds unlikely to be normal performance for a core 2 duo based modern computer, unless you are using all the memory and it's feeling squeezed? Does it happen like this even if you reboot and just open Terminals/screen and nothing much else? What if you reboot and hold shift to get to safe mode, so no extra software is running, then try it? [Edit: or do you mean screen itself is fast but it causes other GUI programs to lag?]This might be because building needs to run through a lot of small files, and the SSD in the Air makes that significantly faster than the disk in the Mac Pro. Should be able to use that to convince your boss to buy you an SSD at work ;)true! need more characters@nomad - I have performed the above, and it looks like it woked... however, I still have a /Developer folder which contains several subfolders and files, totalling around 65MB.  Can I get rid of these files?@mrwooster: Do not get rid of anything in the Developer folder. That contains links to headers, frameworks, and system resources. The Developer folder is an all or nothing deal.But the /Developer folder is not present on a fresh OSX install?  Or is it the remains of the tools that are still required by programs that I have installed since installing xcode?If you still see a Developer folder, then I would argue against your use of the term "fresh install". The Developer folder has never been part of a Mac OS X install; Xcode has always been separate and therefore deliberate since most users do not need it. Downloading and installing the latest version of the Developer tools will bring the whole toolkit up-to-date. But, you should just be able to trash the Developer folder in of itself and reinstall without any problems. Just don't delete any individual bits inside to be on the safe side.Nope. As stated in the question, printing the email only shows the icon. And, if I can't successfully print the full details of even one events, how will an applescript help me print multiple?Capture One from Phase One.The problem lies in that you want an action to trigger (changing the terminal colours). I don't think iTerm 2 has hooks in to these things. Yes, it can change the tab bar title, but you can't extend that hook with generic AppleScript or any such thing.@mrwooster the remnants files in your /Developer is most likely because of the documentation downloaded when your Xcode periodically checks for update. So long as you didn't see any error messages performing the "sudo ..." (for e.g. error messages that suggested some links/files are missing), it's OK to Trash them (after you restart so that these libraries and frameworks are no longer in memory, else you can't empty trash).@mrwooster One important note to remember, please use the uninstall script that came TOGETHER with the Xcode version you installed as different Xcode versions may have slightly different scripts. Lastly, don't install different version of Xcode stacked one on top of another -- that's a quick way to potentially have corrupted links that's a pain (doable, but still a pain) to remove.  Please mark your question as answered if this solves the problem you're facing, thanks.intersting. I also use Good Reader for all my pdf's, but not sure how to sync that w/ Dropbox. tell me how can I do that ?Unfortunaly i don't have access to the wireless router which is broadcasting the wrong country code. I had seen that discussion thread before, but the room i am in is quite far from the correct router and every reboot there seems to find the US broadcasting router. interestingly though, KisMAC says it can detect routers on channel 13, even when the country code is set to US. So i may look into that later.Dont worry, I wont forget to mark as answered ;)... I used the script that came with that XCode install, and have not installed any other versions.... there are still some files that are not documentation, but I would like to remove them, so going to do a time machine backup and then try deleting.... not ideal, but at least I can restore if it all goes tits up.@mrwooster. Sounds like you have successfully removed a clean Xcode install, so doubtful you'll need to restore from a Time Machine. One last tip, maybe helpful to do a Time Machine backup after you've successfully installed Xcode AND downloaded the documentation. Good luck and happy coding.Precisely, I've already unchecked that option in Finder Preferences, but some files still show file extensions, .avi's, for instance.It's quite new feature, see this notes for details:http://www.goodreader.net/gr-man-tr-servers.html#syncI have check this again today and KisMAC is able to find my router and identify that it is on channel 13 despite having the country code as US and 13 not being in the list of supported channelsI'm reasonably well versed in the formal titles for Classical compositions :). Cover View is the widest display canvas I know of, if for no other reason than by the obvious fact that your device is horizontal. If it's too big for that, then I'm afraid that's as good as it gets without perhaps a dedicated Music Display third-party app.Since when chat is less invasive than email? O_o@Tessallating I don't consider it easier needing a line of view and pointing to the device in the proper way. And he never said his friend is close by. I might want to share links with my friend in another country. But that's an interesting idea anyway. :P I still find the best way for doing it while nearby would be something like bonjour / bluetooth show devices nearby and send. But it would need to be integrated with the browser and to do it with safari jailbreak is needed, which breaks the "easy" part again.I know apps are capable of blocking the sleep timeout from occurring, so this sounds like either a bug in Pandora, iOS itself, or something else. My theory: When you plug the cable in AFTER launching Pandora, the app "sees" the power state, and keeps the screen on. It apparently doesn't read the power state on launch. Presumably this also means you can unplug/replug the cable at any time after the app launches to keep it awake too.One SIMBL Extension i have installed is "[The Unarchiever](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html)" which replaces the Finder File-Compression/decompression-Function and supports more Formats.The Unarchiver is not a SIMBL plugin.I wasn't really making a claim regarding E-mail vs Chat.

There will always be errors. (Although that error is more than I would expect I would expect accuracy to 14-15 significant figures)I wish there could be a way to map some abbreviations to the Programmer's mode of the Calculator.app (I guess that is beyond lazy)@sorens this isn't the first time I've seen this util promoted but I have to ask: why? OS X does its own temperature monitoring and should spin up the fan of its own accord when internal temperatures are too high for ambient heat dissipation to work well.you are right, you can leave the OS to handle it. In my case, when I would play WoW in max res with all settings turned up and in full-screen, the OS would let the graphics card get hot enough that the game would crash. If I turned up the fan a little bit before I started playing, I never had an issue with the game freezing due to the graphics card being too hot. YMMV obviously. If you notice freezes and the temp on your GC is high, then it might be time to seek out this util. Otherwise, you are probably fine.@sorens: thanks for that. I've never encountered a situation where the OS guessed wrong like that. Surprising. I guess the existence of the app means more than a few people need this kind of control.I tried this out last night using my wife's iPad. It worked great, right up to the point where I fell asleep. iPad + developer documentation + bed = sleep FYI. If you are using an iPad to read while horizontal, definitely turn on the screen lock. Double-click the home button and then swipe from left to right on the bottom bar that slides up.Thanks for all your comments - I think a PS3 would be great, just weighing up costs, but I like the way you can keep media on a Hard Drive and then plug it in to the PS3 as well as using it as a games console.@Mark Yes, I expected it to be more precise too, that is why I added that example.

Either way, however, I did vote up your question because it is something that has confused me and an answer would be helpful for me as well.@Philip: ok, fine :)For FTP I do prefer [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/download.php) because it is free and cross-platform.Following @CajunLuke answer, can you tell us which MBP you have?Well, we can be sure that it [will blend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAl28d6tbko).Seriously, this question is to vague to be answered. It depends on too many factor to have a definitive answer. Which is what this site is aiming for.By the way, this is a "duh" question indeed! But we only close off-topic. ;)Must be in a different version of word. I see PasteFormat & PasteFromScrapbook, but not PasteDestinationFormatting.

There is not need to change the input device on the software. In fact if you try to change it to line-in it will not work, because you still have the line-in/mic line not used.I was able to install ubuntu only from a burned CD but configuring Parallels works, the only VM solution that worked for me so far with real partitions.@ghoppe, if you make this comment an answer, I'll mark it as accepted -- I just ordered a pair, and will report back.An interesting note: in my (fairly ancient) iBook G4, the headphones with inline controls don't get stereo sound *unless* I hold down the "play" button.you could edit my answer, but I think your comments are worthy of their own 'answer'. To silence the process ID, perhaps something before `|say` like `|grep -v ^[0-9]*$`, etc.Erm... $500 for the software isn't much better than spending all that money on the hardware. But +1 :)As you work for an academic institution you should be eligible for academic pricing on Apple hardware and software products. I suggest you get in touch with your campus bookstore to see if you can get a MacBook or a Mac Mini at a preferred rate.You should check with your campus bookstore before you buy direct from Apple. It is likely they have a university agreement with Apple and can get you Apple hardware and software at a substantial discount. You may even have a site-wide license for OS X server already --which means you could use it for no additional money.We have licenses, but only for the desktop product. We don't have any Mac servers (UNIX boxes for most everything, a few Windows boxes for Active Directory)@Boris: Thanks for letting me know. I'd thought that you had a two-part problem, but I figured that it was best for future questioners if I just answered the actual question you asked.Don't know if you're still interested in this question; I answered it before I noticed it was on the old side. Let me know if the answer is helpful.this sounds similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9044/, except that you need something that will work on a motorcycleupdate: I just noticed that the padding around the earphones has started wear and degrade. This hasn't impacted me yet. My set is a few years old at this point, but it still seems that the material is degrading faster than I would like.You can only virtualize Snow Leopard Server on Apple-branded hardware, and it checks to make sure during installation.Ah, that sounds familiar now. Thanks!@Kyle Cronin: Thanks for that. I was unsure if it was in fact limited to Apple hardware only for virtualization. The article I linked to is vague about the Apple hardware requirement for the VM.Also: a Mac Mini will suffice for an evaluation and they're about as expensive as that Lenovo laptop.@Ian: Hmm.. that's an even worse proposition though. $800 for a machine less powerful than the one I built a year ago for $300 on my desk.Actually, there's **two** headphone volumes: one for headphones with inline controls and one for headphones without.@Billy What's the value, to you, of a computer being able to run Mac OS X? It's certainly not $0, otherwise you wouldn't be asking. Given your use scenario, I suggest that it's easily a few hundred dollars. Once you subtract that from the cost of a Mac Mini it becomes much more competitively priced compared to commodity hardware.@Kyle: Yes, that cost is greater than zero. But it can't offset a difference of almost 3 times the price for the machine. I've got more hardware here than I know what to do with, and it stinks that I can't just throw OSX inside of VMWare and play. \*grumble\* ;)Ian C. has answered your question: the EULA requires Apple hardware; anything else is a breach of contract.  You have more hardware than you know what to do with, so consider selling the excess and using the proceeds to purchase a Mac/OS hardware/OS/software bundle.  Perhaps you can find a Mac owner who you can persuade to trade, on the grounds that the machine you built last year is much more powerful.And it's not hidden either.It must be intended for videos then. Thanks!Apple's website seems to say that you can have 3 wifi connections, 1 bluetooth connection, and 1 usb connection to make 5.That could be why it's there, but in my experience it captures audio from the front very well too. It even works well when the iPod is sitting on a table, so the microphone is pretty much touching.That's strange: my Verizon Pre Plus can host 5 devices; I wouldn't think Apple would hobble the iPhone more.Oops.  You're right.  It's right there as the first item in the Window menu.I just checked (http://www.apple.com/ios/) and it says up to 3 on wifi, up to 3 on bluetooth, and 1 on usb, with a maximum of 5 at a time.If you need OSX for " for the purpose of IT support" then the University will buy it otherwise they cannot support Macs@Mark: Problem is several students already own their own.So who is asking for the support - if your managers then ask them for the tools - otherwise who is rewarding you to support them`exiftags` or `exiftools` work well.You're right, that is confusing indeed. What do the "Sharing" preferences affect, if not Home Sharing?They affect the library sharing, which you have to turn on to access those settings but not to use home sharing. Library sharing allows anyone on the same network to see your music, but home sharing allows only people with your apple id and password to see it.FWIW New Zealand has no extra fee for tethering via usb, bluetooth or wifi - you just use your existing data bundle / pay as you go data. It's shocking how much U.S. networks make you guys pay for something we take for granted (but your iPhones are quite a bit cheaper!)Yeah, remember that different carriers have different rules for tethering and such.I think the best community for this sort of thing can be found using the search term "iboot + multibeast".Is RCDefault scriptable?

I'd probably just use Preview. But lots of these screenshots I just want to keep on my iPad and don't want to have to transfer anyway. I know of the many App Store apps that rotate. Obviously my real goal here is to make it not happen at all. I was hoping this was a bug.By the tags, I guess the application in question is XCode (4?). It should be installed under /Developer, but I still have 3.2.5 there, personally, despite having bought version 4 from the App Store.Ok, httpfs is not suitable for your task, it will not mount a http directory structure, it will only mount fs style images like ISOs, DMGs etc.  What you need really is a script to grab the URLs you want.@David each community is only best for the specific range of hardware they're interested in supporting. E.G. you could run OS X on an AMD machine, that community has no interest in supporting this option.translation: rent or lease. :PI'm suggesting something a bit more casual than leasing (read cheaper, since that seems to be Billy's main concern.)Good suggestion.

Your answer may be helpful to others, though.If you make the Image Capture window wider, the rotate buttons will appear in the toolbar.This was in iOS 4.2 and before too (not entirely sure when it first appeared), but with a different name and better hidden. Probably dependent on the carrier. At least I've used it several times beforeHow are you changing the image? Is there any error message or other feedback?Nevermind, I have type declarations for all the file types I am interested in.I'd be worried about theft.rebooting ipad does solve the error msg problem, but i still get the continuos disconnect issue.also iphone's battery will probably not be able to handle tethering for 3 devices even if connected directly to the power. when I'm using just skype on my 3GS, be it with cable or bluetooth, the battery runs out after some hours.Non-jailbroken? I've used various tetherings before but this is the first time I've been able to use it as an Access Point.I am not sure what I am looking for exists. I looked at Dropbox, but it doesn't automatically sync photos to the iPad -- it seems to work the same as MobileMe Gallery where it caches photos when browsed. The other issue is that there isn't an easy way to export from iPhoto to Dropbox.Odd that the Camtasia-Mac version is $99 and the Windows version is $299.  I wonder what you get for the extra $200.Do you need all the features of GIMP? If not, [Seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/) is a GIMP fork with a Cocoa interface. Not as feature-rich but the UI is much more Mac-friendly.Thanks for the answers. Since none of the answers are an exact fit, I'm going to leave it open for a bit to see if there are more suggestions.Not a great solution, but it seems there is no better option.This doesn't answer the question. Some people (1) Don't have the technical inclination to install the jailbreak (2) Prefer not to open up their iPhones to another vector of possible trojans etc. (3) Don't want to worry if future updates may break the jailbreak, or be continually behind in software updatesyeah, not jailbroken. No WiFi on 3GS, but Bluetooth and USBOr I need to keep my phone unjailbroken for development. Although I am tempted to jailbreak more than ever.I've tried both double-clicking on the image while editing an entry, as well as Card -> Choose Custom Image. There's no popup error message and nothing obvious on the console.I didn't know about using the shortcuts while dragging the window. Still, having a dedicated shortcut is even more convenient.Yeah, I just don't like using more than 1 e-mail address. I figured Apple would have had a solution or procedure in place so that if I get one of their premium service e-mail addresses (with MobileMe), that I'd be able to either transfer all my purchases over to that new Apple ID or something.Always go for a higher speed processor, so that it can be used for future. Also please list out what types of programs you use with this new Mac, is it just email, music and movies or use any complex applications like Adobe Photoshop, Apple Aperture etc...And all your stuff will be synched back from the back up in iTunes.

Sometimes mac os x can be to simple ;)I'm not sure why you got downvoted for this, so I upvoted you to balance it out. This is overkill for most cases, but if you want to make sure their files are unrecoverable, this is the proper technique.@Per Wikilander: Yes, if you "restore from backup" you may be able to put the info back on your iPhone that was on there last time your iPhone was synced properly.@garikapati You're asking me what type of applications I use so you can say whether the hardward makes a difference. That's not *exactly* what I was asking. My question is in general, for what types of applications will this hardware make an observable difference? Unlike @Split71, I don't think this is a subjective question just because I'm talking about applications in general.This question is 'Subjective', per AskDifferent norms are considered. But, to answer straight, high CPU and GPU intensive applications like Photoshop and Aperture or any video editing, Gaming etc.. will make sense for higher capacitive graphics card in Mac. Hope this helps.I should add that if you're looking for a GUI way to this, I haven't found one yet.  This buried functionality only exist for use by Fusion's ability to boot a Boot Camp partition.Not really an answer, but anecdotal evidence in support of AppleCare. I had a MacBook Pro 15" and used AppleCare many times over 3 years: 2 new batteries, a new logic board, a new hard drive, a new super drive, and 2 new fans... Basically, stuff happened and they were always willing to take it in a fix it for free. They hardly every argued (I had to visit twice prove the super drive issue since it would play DVDs but wouldn't read the Snow Leopard installation disc) and it was just nice to know they weren't just trying to rip me off with a warranty I'd never use or be able to use.When I took my iBook in to be serviced one time they replaced the keyboard because it was *dirty*. (Granted, iBooks have an easily-removable keyboard, but still.)Suppose I were to go this route and a part in my laptop were to break, where would I buy individual replacement parts? It makes sense and sounds good in theory but I just don't know where to buy the parts...Don't they do it for free for the Nvidia recall, even though you don't have Apple Care ?The card itself was free because of the recall, but the keyboard would not have been if the laptop was out of warranty.I suspect, from bits of text I found while searching Google, that previous versions of OS X did in fact show the shares ending in a dollar sign. I would like to have the capability to list all shares, so that I don't have to remember them and don't need to clutter the bookmarks region with them.Interesting sidenote: the command `smbclient -L computer -U user -W DOMAIN` (filling in 'computer', 'user', and 'DOMAIN') does indeed show all shares including those which end in a dollar sign. So it appears something differs between `smbclient` and the way in which Finder browses servers.Adding RAM should give you performance improvements unless you had a lot to begin with. It might be a little faster to use the 64 bit kernel, but it probably won't make much difference compared to doubling the RAM.You can still have Apple repair (for a price) your computers even without AppleCare.Snapz has no editing capabilities; all it can do is capture (and it takes a long time to render video captures). You would need to import the QuickTime files it creates into iMovie or Final Cut to get the same editing facilities in either of the other two programs.@PerfectlyNormal - Interesting. I may try to see if I can find an non-upgraded phone to experiment with.Yeah, your username (@NSGod) is the correct choice for you. The level of detail in this is nothing short of spectacular.It looks like this problem was actually due to software actively relaying things. Namely: iTunes was actively relaying the existence of an AppleTV across the VPN. I think. Regardless, with a standard set of apps, nothing is exposed from my computer outside of my computer itself. Thanks for sticking around with me on this.Similar question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4777/Unfortunately I get this error: 2011-03-11 15:06:12.295 defaults[1155:903] Could not write domain com.apple.iWork09; exiting - I'll have a little Google.

However, I am only using this for a simple backup of my gmail. I don't plan to use Mail.app for anything else. Pop seemed simpler for backup because I can more easily tell that the email is actually on my local machine. Maybe I'm missing something. Am I wrong about this?By default Mail will synchronize all messages locally; you can verify that in the account settings.  My main worry is that POP3 likes to delete what it's downloaded, and if you *don't* let it do so then it has an annoying tendency to get confused and endlessly re-download messages it already has.  (POP3's a rather unintelligent protocol, and Gmail's a rather noncompliant mail server.)Although now I check your profile - PHD in Bioinformatics? Interests in solving problems with "large numbers of small overlapping reads" and "organizing a vast amount of information"? That sounds like just the sort of niche where the alternative use of video cards I mentioned could be beneficial - see http://www.nvidia.com/object/bio_info_life_sciences.html for example; the 6750M is from ATI, they have a similar technology - see the OpenCL section here: http://www.apple.com/macosx/technology/ - so give some thought to this and whether it would benefit you.In earlier models it's a bit different - the late 2008 15" has an ExpressCard slot. Still only 2 USB sockets though.Thanks Dori. In the interim I've actually found it to be a combination of cold glass/ screen mixed with moisture.

Thanks!@torbengb Indeed, though you could technically have a friend -- or a publisher of some kind -- do the final build for submission.I've got the Tiger edition of the book.  While UNIX is relatively stable, some of the OS X specific features change quite a bit between OS X releases.@g This problem intrigues me. It is a simple problem and I'm sure there should be a simple solution but there doesn't really seem to be one.i have gnupg installed so it is most likely due to this... I will move to a temp folder as recommended.  ThanksThat is clearly asking about ssh and sftp.I can just add, that I solved (a bit) a problem with macbook with faster memory modules. I bought low latency CL4 memory modules. Unfortunately, they are still 677MHz and you can feel it, especially if you are using some heavy data numerics (like big matrixes in matlab). These modules already costed me extra $$ and this is only temp solution.

This is also why I will upgrade my iPad1 to iPad2 (I can do that for little money).Sorry, but I do not want to use virtualization.You're right. I'm updating my answer to reflect that.@Sorin Sbarnea any specific reason why you don't want to?I want to be able to use Windows 7 without virtualization overhead. Maybe I will want to play some games at full speed :DYeah and just submit to apple's following locking you out of hundreds of features and useful things in iOSSounds quite logical. Let's hope there's other ways to not have 2 keyboards on a desk.While you wait for an answer, I would guess there is actually no way to fix this, even with jailbreak. While it should be possible, I don't believe anyone bothered to do it.Thanks VxJasonxV. Prowl allows you create an email address from the API key. This was very easy to set up. I now forward my email from Google Voice to the API key email address (40285a2b74f2c02fe250593e97ea8722c58056d3@api.prowlapp.com). The problem is that Google Voice does not give you an email address that you can send a text message to. Other providers provide an email address such 12345678990@vtext.com (Verizon Wireless) so you can text somebody via email.Unmount is the same as right-clicking and ejecting the disc right? Unfortunately that's not working, it still says that this partition cannot be modifiedI'll be following this question. I've been somewhat of an outlining software for Mac geek since the ancient days of ThinkTank and MORE, but I'd never heard of NeO. Just the screenshots look intimidating.That is true, and is a recent feature. Glad it works fo ryou. P.S. You may want to delete your comment, because you're not supposed to generally give out your API key.Unfortunately I don't have unpartioned space left, and I don't have space to backup my data and reformat the whole disc :'(

Please feel free to mark this question as answered.That won't work with an iPod Nano, though, right?`Esc` works too, but it more unsafe due to `Esc` usually having another function. But it works :).It's stunning how many people don't know about this. Of course, I remember when I was complaining about "how bad OSX's Alt Tab is, because it doesn't show all windows". Then I learned how to do it better.And it won't. This is Snow Leopard only. For Leopard I suggest checking out SoundSource: http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/Holding Alt/Option in the `Virtual Machine` window on VMWare Fusion gives you options to explicitly/forcefully kill the selected Virtual Machine. Instead of gracefully. (Read: Pull the plug instead of pushing the power button.)You know, I've never tried special clicks on the drag box. Thanks!Yes, and the `while ... do` form makes sure it does the _read line/say line_ pair over and over. (The problem is that when you pipe input into `say`, it waits until the entire end of the input before speaking all of it at once, however `read` takes one line and stops. So the code chops a continuous output into line-sized chunks and launches `say` once for each chunk).Yeah I know about this one, I'm looking for extra templates.And for a file? Note my comment re: avi files@KyleCronin, if you post that as an answer, I'll accept it. With everyone I've met in person, the behavior is quite obvious once I've demonstrated it.

For the most part  the lacking features are restricted due to a technical constraint: battery life. And other part because of apple: photos taken on the iOS are easy to share, but ones synced through iTunes are encrypted and mostly unshareable - plus allowing the "push out" part of syncing anything to anywhere shouldn't be too hard on the battery.I assume you mean a background image that you select for a folder's icon view. Just to clarity, you don't mean the background image that you see when you don't have any windows open ('Desktop')?Most advice I read concerning fsck suggests that it's a poor idea to run it on a mounted file system because the FS can change underneath it, and that it won't fix any errors in that case.  Thus, my recommendation for running it in single-user mode.  See http://hintsforums.macworld.com/archive/index.php/t-2666.html , for example; or Google 'fsck multi-user' for others.I mean the background image for a Finder window/Folder's icon view. **NOT** the Desktop background.That's why I said 'on the install disc'. That way, you've booted with the CD and the HDD's fs isn't in the way.I don't see More > Shared on the iPhone's iPod app.Thanks! I'll try some of those things.Battery life? iTunes? Encryption? I don't see those as relevant. (Do I need to clarify the question?) I believe the biggest problem is that app designers assume the Internet is always present. The photos would come from the Internet all in one go but stored for offline viewing -- kind of like email.Well @g, if you didn't get my point there might be due to a lot of things you are missing. Those on your question marks are issues both developers and apple have to deal with when we talk about syncing and that includes having things for offline access. Pushing e-mail is already one of the biggest battery consumptions feature and it's only text. But I completely agree too many developers have internet as granted to be always online, while it isn't true.I preferred using MarsEdit when my blogs were on MovableType (an old version at that), but now that they are on WordPress, I just use the built-in WP editor.@Rob Never solved it. It works perfectly on my home network, and not on my work network.Just a quick tip; a lot of US only sites keep a list of known proxy servers and block them as well.

BTW i know it's a kernel panic but i've never seen this "verbose-mode-overlay"When you have verbose mode enabled you get verbose kernel panics too instead of the "you must restart your computer" screen.

All that is working now.I bit the bullet and reset sync services; no change.That sounds like a lot of work and I have quite a few by now. I hope that doesn't become necessary. In case you didn't know it's happening to ALL apps. I have noticed though it SEEMS as though when an app gets an ADDITIONAL update for an app that has already pushed out an update, it straightens everything out for apps that are actually up to date. But it starts all over again. It's hard to explain, but it has happened a few times and have noticed the pattern.Is there a layman way of reading the cause of a kernel panic? Is it safe to share your logs in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports? Is there any sensitive/private information contained in them?@mankoff: `??follow?dependencies` vs. `??follow?dependents`; the quoted passage describes both, but only the first applies to the question@HandyRandy: the panic logs aren't going to be terribly readable to anyone other than a kernel programmer -- in this case, you can tell that the kernel extension "com.rogueamoeba.hermes" was involved (and since the current process was kextd, which loads & unloads kernel extensions, hermes may've either just been loaded or some other extension that conflicts with it just loaded).  The logs should generally be safe to share, although it's there's a very small probability something sensitive will happen to be in a register or the call stack when it crashes.any progress on the overnight battery draining? I have the same issueWhile the attributes these files (technically "[AppleDouble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleDouble)" files) are generally unnecessary, there are a few cases where they are actually important.  Alias files are an example that comes to mind -- without the type code, they won't even be recognized as aliases.@Mark: yeah, it is.Not sure what caused it to suddenly work, but it works now. Thanks for the screenshots, they should help others in the future.But on Ubuntu, they're not going to be recognized anyway.  (See the original question.)agreed, as long as the files will be used on the Ubuntu system (where things like aliases wouldn't work anyway).  If they were going Mac -> Ubuntu -> Mac, then the AppleDoubles might matter.@Cesar the iphone will act as a wifi access point.Did you try to buy a free app and *then* clicked on the "create new account" button or did you try directly creating a new account? The "None" option only appears in the first case, as far as I know.My point is that it doesn't have to be complicated. You don't need iTunes, you don't need to encrypt photos, and battery life wouldn't be anymore than if you downloaded each photo individually as you are forced to do currently. It doesn't have to 'push' new photos instantly to the iPad. It could be done with a simple button like the old school check for e-mail. The current apps are almost there, but the key point that seems to be missing is that there is no way to download all the photos. You have to go through and select each one individually. Perhaps that is what I didn't make clear?@Cawas: Thanks. I have upgraded to 4.3 now and I can see how it works.I seriously doubt it will ever happen. Dropbox makes their revenue from selling upgraded accounts with more storage. If they started letting people have multiple free accounts, their revenue will drop.Sadly, not anymore :)Look at the accepted answer, MDB. Under iOS 4.0 and newer, the iPod touch WiFi is left running when the device sleeps. This is nice, in a way: You can get push notifications and emails without having the device active. But when you're not using it for a long period, you really *have to* turn on airplane mode. For this reason, I have the Settings app in my dock, so it shows on every home screen.I think that through Home Sharing, you may only stream iTunes compatible videos. So Air Video Server is still needed for all other video formats!The nano doesn't run iOS, so there's no apps tab.I agree it would be a lot easier to manage with just one, at least from a users perspectiveThe accuracy is going to be very poor, particularly indoors where GPS doesn't work well.@gabe there's not even a GPS on the wifi modelI believe that only works on a "per folder" basis, not as a default (like the OP suggested), since that value gets stored in the .DS file.+1 for iTerm 2. I have recently moved completely over to iTerm 2.Thanks for your reply. Before I discovered the problem, I used to calibrate the battery once every couple of seconds. Now that the laptop shuts off suddenly at around 30% charge left, I am not sure how to *properly* perform the calibration process.Thank you for sharing your insights. Yes, I have all the updates installed on this system. I will check with an Apple Store, though I have a feeling I will have to end up getting a new one.Thank you for your reply, MacDaemon.thank you for your comment. I've updated the answer. cheers ;)Thanks a lot for the response. But wouldn't iTunes' Restore to Factory Settings force me to update the firmware?The calibration process I'm talking about involves a complete charge, discharge, and re-charge.  I don't see how that would be doable in less than half a day.  Are we talking about the same process?I did this like 2 weeks ago when my collegues got an IPhones.Not sure, but what ever it is, it would involve "BTStack" which is a custom BlueTooth driver written for the iPhone with less restrictions then the built in iPhone driver. See here for more information: http://code.google.com/p/btstack/How is this different from what I already did?I only suggest this because I had a VERY similar issue with my iPhone and as a result I had to uninstall and reinstall ever app, there was about 30. Took me a while but all was well afterwards.I think I tried to download an app and saw that I needed an account, so I went to the Apple website and made one and then I tried again and had to select a credit card.You just went and created new account. What you need to do is you need to install itunes and then enter the Store.. find some free app and try to download it.. it will tell you to login/create new account. Do so and you will have option "none". You have to do all that from ITunes not from Apple website or anywhere else.I don't see the problem. You are still getting the store credit that you can use in the store...Yes, that's what I did. Maybe the question isn't clear, I'll edit.Well, ideally I shouldn't have to pay more for this; they're free apps, after all.@Nathan OK, thanks. I'm going to try ZAGG and Zingersoft customer support first. I'll submit an answer here if I get a good response.@Pablo, yes, as I said in the answer (iOS updates = firmware updates).Not an exact duplicate, but pretty close. See: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9740/can-i-tell-iterm-2-to-change-color-when-im-rootHow do I manually sync my iTunes library?Thanks but this document, as with all other references I have found, refers to moving the media (all the music files) that my iTunes library file refers to.  What I am talking about is moving my iTunes library file itself...that single file that is stored in the My Music folder.  I'm concerned about the implications of moving that file to a new machine and the effect on sync'ing history.If re-syncing the library means to delete the library and recreate it like I've seen here http://digitalpbk.blogspot.com/2009/06/ipod-resynch-itunes-apple-library-copy.html then this is EXACTLY one of the things I want to avoid.What do you mean by 'history'? Things like play and skip counts and ratings?Out of curiosity, why are you shying away from MacPorts? I can't speak for Fink, but I always put MacPorts on my machines right away so I can use get ports when I need to. If I get an app for one-time use, I usually just uninstall it after I'm done with it.I know that but it does not tile the image!What IP address you want to be the same, your computer's IP address or your internet IP (as reported by whatismyip.com) ?Because some people just don't have the association of configuration that we do.iTerm 2 generally has nothing specific to do with SSH... iTerm 2 is absolutely fantastic, but it doesn't answer this question, at all.The restore function does not roll back firmware versions. Jailbreakers wouldn't have to worry about not updating if that were the case. The restore function blanks all your data. You network settings, your phone settings, media, apps, etc. (It does not affect the sim card, if applicable.) Whether you do it on the phone itself, or via iTunes, you will wind up with an empty version of the currently installed iOS version.yup, exactly that.There is a way. If there are 3 active WiFi Routers within reachable proximity, you can get WiFi triangulation that is pretty granular. No, it will never be as good as GPS, and just one access point won't pinpoint you at all, but something like a convention hall with lots of Access Point repeaters could make things pretty reliable.Removing fink is `rm -fR /sw` and nothing else should remain.what if the multiple account feature isn't free? Anyway, there must be a model that works.If this is possible, and I think it is a big if, it is likely to be very complex. I don't know why MacPorts was down, and I am a fink not MacPorts user, but I have high confidence in both those apps. There is a big community. They aren't going anywhere anytime soon.As for "not Mac-like"... you want to run X11 apps, Xvfb, etc. I'm not understanding why something un-mac-ish is a problem.Thanks for the info! I'll look into those DDNS services. The only reason (at this point) that I need a static IP is to exclude myself from Google Analytics data.@Nathan I believe Google Analytics will allow you to specify a host name, but I can't tell for sure.I can exclude traffic from a domain, if that's the same thing. I  can specfy that in AirPort utility.Even after a reboot, some could be running. Apps which say they use certain background services can be restarted automatically when that service becomes available (I think location and voip do this).I downloaded this and it does exactly what i want - now if only apple would let developers supply song/album art info for background music it would be great.  Only shows "Podcaster" when you're in lock mode, instead it could easily supply an image and some text?? Is this a question or a rant?According to the Apple specs page, you can use the Air in up to 95*F (35*C) temperatures, and up to 90% humidity. http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.htmlCan you please reformat what you're asking as a question?@VxJasonxV: how does this not answer the question? iTerm 2 supports bookmarks for doing automatic ssh to hosts with a single click. And ssh tunneling is largely just calling ssh with `-D <port> -N` to open the tunnel on a port.I'm closing this question because the only part that isn't localized has already been answered. It's also hard to tell exactly what's being asked here.Glad it worked for youI don't think using DDNS will work for excluding from Google Analytics as it uses reverse DNS to obtain the hostname, which will be something his ISP set and not the DDNS name. Honestly, your best bet for excluding yourself from GA is to block it in your browser.Sorry for the confusion: I am not talking about the completion feature, but the spell checker that underlines in red misspelled words. Then when you click on it, the spell checker suggests correct alternatives. This is a new feature in iOS 4. I amended the question to clarify this.@Cawas, unfortunately, I think you're right ;). So I would suggest that you post this as an answer. This isn't the answer I was hoping for, but it looks like this is this correct answer.@Kyle That's a shame! I've got Ghostery running as a temporary solution.The implication is in the OPs reference to PuTTY. PuTTY doesn't make you issue raw forwarding commands. I gathered from the question that the OP wants an application to help him generate forwarding rules.I was thinking of coastal Southern India where summer temperatures are routinely in the high 90s with over 90 % relative humidity. There is a lot of particulate pollution in the air from diesel and two stroke engines.Thanks for this pointer. Please see my notes above regarding the expected conditions.that's true, once paired you can tether via bluetooth without having to do anything on the phone, but with the wifi you have to turn it on every timeI'll accept this answer if you make it clear that the account needs to be **created** from iTunes and not from the Apple website for the "None" option to appear, because that's what happened.Had the same problem. My iPad has an expired beta (8C5115C) but iTunes won't download an update because "4.2 is the current version."

I feel like I'm dealing with Microsoft. WTF do I have to rely on 3rd party sites that could be bootleg images to work around their developer program?

Oh and +1 to balexandre's suggestion. After verifying that they were actually Apple links I was able to download an image and get my iPad working again.This happened to me three weeks ago. No problems on my bank acc according to my bank they checked the detyails entered on Itunes and all should be fine. Have tried another bank card (Different bank all details verified and OK their end) but the same problem persists and still waiting an answer from Apple.I'm having the same problem, I keep getting that my card has been declined, problem is i'm using paypal, I just tried it using a itunes gift card and it's still telling me my card has been declined.Thanks to both. The described climate seems so close to the upper limit of the MacBook Air that I would not recommend using it in these circumstances.This does **NOT** work with *all* apps. I closed the Mail app this way, and it is still present in the SBSettings task manager. Its possible Apple has special rules for their own apps, or that certain apps can circumvent this. It *did* work for several other apps I tried.I dunno about that, nslookup returns the correct IP, at least for no-ip.org.I *believe* that opening a .DMG file automatically verifies it. Basically, it contains a checksum in the file (or are you worried about malicious packages, rather then just corruption?).I'm just worrying about the corruption. And I'm also curious about where Apple stores the checksum in the file? Can I extract it from the dmg?Why not? Is there a Stack Exchange policy against promoting my own creation via my sig line in exchange for my participation on this site? Who does it harm?For me, usually just a normal click of any kind is enough to get it to reconnect.really. Can you describe the rebuild process? I mean, what will I have to do to get things going again?Really appreciate all your attempts to help me with this one, deeviate. I know the DNS servers work because other computers on the network can resolve hosts. I also need local DNS servers to resolve internal addresses, so I can't use the Google ones.Thanks for the suggestion Split71, I'll give it a go next time it happens.Deleting/Reinstalling iTunes worked. Thanks very much.Thanks for the link on how to reinstall iTunes. That was the fix.Ah, Mail probably is a special case, as are Messages (SMS) and Phone, which obviously keep running. I suspect that nothing will kill the Mail process permanently.@Nathan: See how you can ignore traffic in GA based on cookie: http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=55481Read the FAQ: http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq It clearly states *not to use signatures*. You can put links on your user page, but should not put them in your posts.Jailbreaking is terrible for lots of reasons, too. Best of luck with it.@Fake Name: I guess you should repost this as an answer, to get the proper upvotes this deserves.

@stid: you can use `hdiutil verify /path/to/image.dmg` on the command line to compare an image against its internal checksum.Great to hear, reinstalling has fixed soo many problems I have run across@Matthew Frederick - Such as? Name some....@Nathan it was a question on meta how to ask a similar question. then I was told it was a question so I should ask it. When I then investigated myself after moving it here, I found out it was not to be due to t-mobile decisions. What is "Too localised" ? how many potential users needs to be affected for something not to be too localised? I could say the same about issues only affecting Verizon customers with iPads, no? Anyway I reformulated it, so can it be re-opened?Bricking the device if the jailbreak fails. Breaking your warrantee, such that if you have a hardware problem and can't restore it to a non-jailbroken state before taking it to Apple, you'll pay full price for any repairs, even if they're due to a manufacturing defect. Apps run outside the sandbox on jailbroken phones, so they can do anything they want, including sending your personal information (including call records, all text messages, your email, many app passwords, etc.) to anyone. Malware disguised as cool apps. And much, much more.Did you not look into it before jailbreaking?@nuc OS X supports an icon size maximum of 512x512, so I see no point (well, maybe other than future-proofing perhaps) saving it bigger. And while you're at the command line, you could resize the image's longest length to 512 e.g. with sips: `sips -Z 512 image.png --out smaller-image.png` (though if you'd like to have control over the resampling algorithms, maybe an image processing software is a better idea).Edited to be more clear.Have you tried it? For me it starts Chrome with the plugins enabled.@sorin-sbarnea Given your problem here and in the question I suspect Chrome has a problem here. I have used Chrome with some arguments in both waysFirefox requires a Window library to be linked with e.g. QT, Gnome and so will need a lot of other code so using Macports/Fink would save timeI'll give it another go, perhaps I made a mistake before.Braking your warranty is a non-issue, you just flash to stock. As far as I know, no malware has made it into Cydia, and if you feel you can't trust Cydia, I don't see why you would trust the App Store, considering the irregularities in apple's screening process, and the numerous userland exploits used to break out of the sandbox to install jailbreak in the first place, which crop up regularly (If the sandbox was secure, jailbreaking would not happen in the first place). The fact that apps can do interesting things as root/privileged user is half of the *advantage* of jailbreaking.@martin: Done..Thanks for your reply.+1 for opendiffSee my answer to your other question. Ditto anthonyg's recommendation.Great, thank you.could I do it without the sudo, i'm not the admin could I just "unmark" it?@alvar you can try without the sudo, it won't hurt. But since you're not an admin, it might be the reason why Mac OS X cannot remove the flag when you open it.@Mark: sure, cool cool. If anyone wants to pop that in as an answer, we can consider this question done.I've been using Kaleidoscope for a few months now. Worth the price. It goes on sale occasionally.Combine with cloudApp to insta-upload on the web and put the URL in your clipboard instead@VxJasonxV I guess I live by the teach-a-man-to-fish philosophy. You learn the ssh tunnel setup stuff once and you're set for life.I will try that, since my father doesn't care that much, he's using Safari. He is also a really stubborn mac user and says "I don't use the terminal because I have a mac" or something similar to that.I can't find the "~" on my apple keyboard! :Ohahahahaha was my reaction ;) how did you find out about it?@Alvar I'm a keyboard freak. When I first started using macs few years ago, moving from windows and missing some shortcuts, I went through System Preferences, Help files and Google looking for what was already available. I actually found it on the Help, tho it's also in SP -> Keyboard.For what is worth, I experience the same behavior.possible duplicate of [Concisely starting Mac OS apps from the command line](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4240/concisely-starting-mac-os-apps-from-the-command-line)It should be to the left of the 1 key :)Thanks a lot! This was driving me (almost) crazy.Iv tried that, there is to much information there to find it, if it is even there. I don't think it is the source for the particular page i think it is the whole site. Do you not no of any apps or plugins i could get? Thanks :-)No it will be the source of that page not the whole siteI wouldn't presume on the OPs methods of doing things. Also, there is more to learning ssh tunneling than the raw commands. The application and use of local, remote, or dynamic forwards are equally as relevant (and in some cases, difficult) as the command line flags.Funny. I use terminals (and a lot of other things) BECAUSE I have a Mac! Better than Windows, less frustrating than Linux.I guess you missed the warranty part where I said "if you have a hardware problem and can't restore it." I understand the advantage of jailbreaking, that something is an advantage doesn't mean it isn't a disadvantage, too. Crazy, right? And no, I do not even *remotely* trust the Cydia **security screening process** the way I do the App Store's. They don't even compare. All of that said, this is no place for a big jailbreaking discussion. I just wanted to point out to any naive readers that it's far from magical unicorn awesomeness. Feel free to continue, of course, but I'm done.You are totally missing the point here.

Firstly, a "hard reset" is defined by the user holding down the home and sleep button (bypassing the red swipe bar) until the phone shuts off. 

Secondly, Apple isn't trying to hide the multi-tasking apps, in fact, THEY FLAUNT IT every chance they get. And they have been doing so since they released it.

What I am saying, is that instead of tapping my screen 20 times to close all the apps in the multi-task bar, there should be one button to clear them all at once. Or a "hard reset" should do it instead.

So, what the hell are you talking about?where was the soundtrack purchased and what format is it in?Hey, try taking a chill pill and stop flipping out over the completely wrong thing before I get a chance to respond. GEESHI noticed that it didn't work if you have "unchecked" the help bar in the system settings. I have the swedish version so I don't now what it says in english, just guessing.I know, I use the terminal for all sort of things like the terminal doctor when I'm feeling sad in the morning or the terminal tetris to cheer me up! :)
Also I use it for ssh. well a lot of universe programs that work for linux works for mac in the terminal, awesome!it worked woho! thanks man! :DAh, I guess it depends on your keyboard version.  I'm referring to the standard North American English keyboard.  It's called the Tilde if you want to look it up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilde#ComputingThen why does it work with Windows Remote Desktop but not the Mac version of Remote Desktop (from Microsoft too)?@Alvar I have no idea what's that "help bar". Can you provide more relevant info? From that symptom alone, I don't think it has anything to do with the swedish version.Glad it worked.Yeah. When I installed mine, I just sort of BS'd with it. If I remember correctly, I configured boot camp not to download the drivers and then it reconfigured the HDD. From there I just installed Windows 7 64-bit, without issues, so not sure where you're hanging up... After the install was done I had to go through the Apple website and get a couple of different versions of the Boot Camp drivers until it got the latest version installed. There's a dependency so you don't have a choice, but to install the previous versions required.For simple development a simple Pentium would suffice. For a laptop computer mobility is 10 times more important than anything else.this does not work in the same manner as openning the application.Why do you "need" to boot into the 64-bit kernel? It's not necessary for anything...I'd also like to know how to **open** an application from command line with **sudo** priviledgeThere are several methods listed on that page. Did you try all of them? Same results for all? Please refine question with more details. Don't just link to that page, tell us what you did.@mankoff: I tried all and all combinations, no results. I did them all.@itaiferber: I explicitly told that I need to do so, hence your comment was flagged as bugous.

Most people incorrectly assume they "need" to boot into a 64-bit kernel to run 64-bit apps and I was trying to assess the situation. You did the right thing though.@Paul Exactly. The same is likely true of the Calendar app: suddenly my appointments aren't current, what the heck? The App Store app, too: why don't I get any of those updates anymore?Similar question: http://superuser.com/questions/110788/internet-sharing-on-mac-behind-proxyGood distinction, however, I do think most people refer to duration as 'battery life' regardless.Somehow this did not work for me at least once or twice. Will try again next time, thanks!I've been using Macs for 10 years and the iPhone since the day it was released. I don't think I have to wait for an Android phone for this change. Mark my words, in iOS 5, there will be a change to the multi-task system and I bet you that they add the ability to close them all at once.Ok, we get that you can't search to find them. But are they visible? Can you just scroll through your list and see them? Can you play the tracks in any other audio player besides iTunes? Do they play in Quicktime?

In my experience, I have found a couple instances that even though the songs were in the correct MP3 format they simply WOULD NOT play for whatever reason. I fixed this issue by using iTunes to re-encode the songs in an MP3 format. You might want to try using iTunes to convert the songs to mp3 again. (or some other lossless format)They are different than mine. But my dmg file did pass the validation check and the installation is successful. I believe that apple offers an unique dmg file for each user.@mplungjan: I'm still not clear on what is being asked here. It reads almost as if you noting a problem and a possible solution or roadblock. Is your question asking how to do what you are stating in your first paragraph? It seems there might be a language barrier here so I we need to sort out a way to validly reopen what looks to be a potentially legitimate question.What version of iOS are you running?  What device? Have you tried locating the app in iTunes after syncing and re-arranging from there?Thanks for the tip+1 for using a rsync based solution. I wrote a blog post about this specific issue (synchronizing music libraries using rsync) : http://tunecrux.com/restoring-files-scattered-backup-drive-rsyncthat pretty much helped me...now i just need to find a service :)@itaiferber: no problems, but any solutions? :D@Philip is this better?According to [this other article at macperformanceguide.com](http://macperformanceguide.com/SnowLeopard-Performance.html), you'll get an additional (generally small) performance boost from running under a 64-bit kernel as well.  In that article, he saw a 3% speed increase importing files into Lightroom 2.4 (that's in addition to the 27% speed increase from running Lightroom itself in 64-bit mode).Searching these items yields the same result as just browsing through them. By searching I meant both of these actions, browsing and using the search function. These tracks DO play in iTunes.@mplungjan: Yes. I have re-opened the question.I meant folders when I said 'grouped apps together'Note that the message "PAE enabled, 64bit mode enabled" does not mean the 64-bit kernel was used. But I guess that's obvious to you now :)That is an obvious possibility, however for folders such as Applications it would mean having an huge image which would have to be tiled manually. If their was someway to tile an image to a certain size automatically then that would be great.Sorry but ipulse does not summarize cpu usage over time, in fact it looks to be only a fancy vizualization over what `top`vprovides.Good question. Is it the OS that is localised? Or is it part of the carrier settings? I must admit I don't know enough about how this is enforced and am curious to see the answers -- even if it isn't possible -- to understand how it works.I would like to choose this answer because `opendiff` could be considered almost "bundled" with the OS X but when I tries to diff two folders it opened an ugly view that was not so easy to understand and also I was not able to see how do I merge two files in file view. I'm sure it is possible but if this basic feature is not obvious, I will prefer to look for something better ;)I just hope that they will make an installer that will be able to install the command line starters and improve the current install experience.It looks to be much better than the FileMerge from XCode, thanks.I think that probably what I was looking for is after `<key>system.privilege.admin</key>`, I modified the timeout from 300 to 3600 - probably from 5min to 50min.@Pacifika in either case, folders or no folders, the only way to bring it back is to move it forwards in the pages with iTunes.@Fake Jailbreaking also brings your battery life to a halt (if you go too coo-coo installing daemons and stuff). I have a couple of iPhone 2G and 3G that were jailbroken "for fun" and their battery lasts less. But I believe Matthew hit the nail.

Nothing changed but only the name.Hmm. Well, you're prompted for your login even if the app is free, so it shouldn't be some weird login bug. Did you download AppShopper first? Or Hunters first?I tried Hunters first.. no good.  Then I tried AppShopper and it worked right away.  It's almost as if free apps are allowed and paid apps are not.  I just tried Sniper vs Sniper (paid) and it won't work.  I also changed my dns on my iphone to point to 4.2.2.2 but still no luck.Hi John. I have the early 2009 17" Mac Book Pro. With that one i don't think the graphics card can be switched on "on the fly". When I want it on it forces a log out log in. Does that mean I shouldn't be affected by Chrome?Because your machine is not PRO, you cannot do it unless you try to modify the efi (as described by ghoppe in his link). There's a list that **excludes** your machine, no matter how 64 bits EFI you have.@AbiusX You really don't know if "only the name" changed, maybe some other internal, in either case, the answer is simple, you cannot boot into 64 bits with a "non pro" Macbook, unless you try the boot.efi modification (which is risky) but might work.@Martin: I think modification of boot.efi wont be so risky, i can simply time machine back to my old system if anything goes wrong, right? Would u please provide me with modification instructions?I actually just converted a lot of my movies using iVI. Its free in the Mac App Store. Now I can play them on our Macs, iPhones, iPad, and Apple TV. Manage it all through iTunes.It just occurred to me that you could probably shut off WiFi when at work, and use 3G. There are of course ramifications to doing so (ex. not on an "unlimited" plan), but it might be the easiest way around this. At least as far as the App Store is concerned.@AbiusX: The link ghoppe posted has instructions for modifying boot.efi.Yes I've done this, and confirmed that it works this way, but some apps that are greater than 10mb (I think) wont' download.  I think i'm on to something though.  Will update.Shortly after it launched, I wanted to research a power adaptor for them while in the local Apple Store. Two of theirs were out of service. They remove them and replace them when it happens so most people aren't aware. Having a spare would be good insurance.I think I fgured something out... I disabled my CSC SSM and the updates started working.  Turned it back on and updates didn't work.  I'm looking into this.  THnaks@g yep, not quite so clear to me! My suggestion would be to create a new question: *"Is there any app out there able to download all photos from MobileMe in one click?"* and, besides that, send a request to apple. Maybe they'll include that in some next patch. :)Now I noticed, this would better fit as a comment as it doesn't answer at all my question! :Prelated: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6005/iphone-app-to-download-upload-filesSo, what was the actual issue? If it's really solved.Sorry, I just added clarification that this particular applies to the mid-2010 model and later.  I'm not sure if prior models are affected at all.  If it seems like the battery is draining faster than it should, you could try making sure the Graphics is set to "Better Battery Life" in the Energy Saver preference pane and see if that makes any difference.another one: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7845/deleting-photos-from-an-iphone/7889#7889Maybe if you added a few screenshots to illustrate your question...You should also note that izymail doesn't appear to be a free service.yeah... if I want to play it at home (using a PC), then will need to buy again for $4.99 using Intel App Up... so... $4.99 x 3 = $15 for iPad, Mac, PC, for the same game...it is Rovio, btw... for the recordIt does have problems in some situations, though. For example when the Mac is accessing the Internet through a VPN: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9849/sharing-a-vpn-connection-using-internet-sharing-via-airportThanks! I wish I could find a picture of the stand...Yeah, I guess jailbraking is a good option. I found this Incarcerapp that locks the home button.Thanks for the hint about the cable. I was thinking of charging the ipads at night and having no cables connected."NOTE: This method might not work for machines managed with Directory Services." - which is exactly the case for my machine.This, but not quite. First you insert the thumbdrive. Then you mount `/Volumes/Mac OS X Install/MacOSX.dmg`. Then, on the dmg, you open  `/Volumes/Mac OS X Install Image/System/Installation/Packages/Mail.pkg`I think I need to reinstall the 10.6.6 Combo Update. Downloading it now. System update is not finding the outdated files.Thanks @g. It works for me!!!Rolled back the edit because I'm specifically asking about data transfer rates in the Migration Assistant scenario, not in a general sense. For example, Thunderbolt and Fiber Channel are both fast data transfer technologies that have been implemented on Macs, but neither is appropriate for Migration Assistant use, putting them in the same boat as USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and eSATA.Yep, Combo update fixed it.@AbiusX: Check the link given by ghoppe, near the end you have to change a bit in the hex file. Handle with care ;) Rather than a Time Machine I'd suggest you create a bootable CLONE of your drive. A lot of things can go wrong forcing you to reinstall the OS. You're not touching a config, you're touching booting files. If you mess up your OS X won't boot anymore. Good luck!Sadly, this question is rethorical. There's no need to obtain "real-world experiences" that won't match the theory. The thing is that each port is faster than the other, so just put them in order: Gigabit > Megabit > FW800 > FW400. So if you can connect both machines to a gigabit switch, it will obviously be faster.I'd say that Megabit would be able to sustain a better transfer rate than FW800. But I don't have anything to back that up.I cant' find it again, but I thought I read that the first iPad is also supported. Only at a lower resolution.It isn't. The iPad only supports video out, not mirroring, using the same video out adapter as the iPad 2.I think that you, me and many others are still looking for an OS X version of [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).I am already aware about common shortcuts, my question was if I can obtain the specified behavior in some way.Thanks, this works, but only with Emacs. Maybe I will try to learn how to use emacs ;)Unfortunately the boot.efi defined in that article is too old and its hash is not the same as mine, So the byte refered to not found. Any more recent instructions?+1 I'll give that a try. Those manual settings for `ipfw` do not persist anywhere, right? (I don't want to break anything). Do I need to reboot to flush them out again, or just a VPN disconnect?Yeah, I understand how routing works when using Shared Networking. In my case the Mac's Parrallels Network IP is 10.113.113.1 and Parallels Windows Client Network IP is 10.113.113.100. From Windows client I am trying to access 10.113.113.1 and it's a no go :(Actually, if @Pacifika arranged everything on the iDevice and would go to move around things on iTunes and sync, everything done on the iDevice would be lost. And, like @level42 said in the other answer, this is not the only way to bring it back. Besides all that, granted, it is the easiest possible way to fix the issue.On mine, I have separate IP for the gateway and for the Mac. Can you use ifconfig in Terminal to see if your Mac has another IP on that sub-network?We have not been using any power monitoring equipment, no. Simply going off the report from the teachers at the high school on that one. *edit* GAH! Note to self: the enter key does not create a new line in comment mode.That is correct!!! Thank you very much indeed. I thought it was kinda obvious it'd use the same one but it doesn't! In my case gateway is 10.113.113.1 and Mac (apache) is 10.113.113.2. Much appreciated! Add this tip to you answer and I will accept it.Might want to try that. There were no indications of such an issue in the classroom, either, but the IT director was an electrical engineering major in college and had them check it. He did the math and found that they were having periodic spikes of thousands of volts...We've done a RAM test on each machine that has had this problem, they all passed. You'd think that if the drive cables were loose the problem would have manifested itself on the same machine a few times on the same iMac, rather than on multiple iMacs. Also, if it were a loose drive cable it's odd that it hasn't occurred to the Bootcamp partitions.Thanks, I kindof forgot to mention I'm using a PC, not a Mac. I'll add that info to my question.Yes I have Air Video (and its great), but need to stream it through Itunes because I want to rout it to my tv afterwards and only Itunes or Youtube is supported by my AV cable.It's possible that the drives are indeed marginal, but I have a hard time buying that one. I've checked, re-checked, and triple checked these drives. I've used Apple's Disk Utility as well as Drive Genius 3 to scan the snot out of the disks. Also, I've never seen a marginal drive without having at least a few indicators in SMART. I've seen "bad" hard disks that passed SMART, but they still had high relocated sector counts and whatnot when using a SMART utility. These drives? Nada.I'm using a PC unfortunately, but a colleague has suggested HandBrake, which I'll give a try.I've thought of Windows screwing with the Mac partition, and I still haven't ruled it out. However, the fact that Apple's bootcamp driver will ONLY mount HFS+ partitions as read-only seems to preclude that. We aren't using any disk tools or "deep freeze" type utilities on the Windows side.You're not...but what about your users? Are you locking out what they can or can't run? Is it possible you have a unique snowflake that found a fun toy online or is running something that is trying to modify the disk directly?Most Windows apps don't quit when you hit escape; they usually only close dialog boxes and pop-up panels. This is the same behavior on the Mac.LOL @ "unique snowflake." As for lockout, all students (and 95% of teachers for that matter) run as limited user accounts in both Windows and Mac. Also, the teacher and students in the Multimedia class are some of the best at this particular school. Not to say that we don't have a misfit, because it's quite possible. Students are also assigned specific machines, so the likelihood of a troublemaker getting access to each of these five machines without drawing attention would be difficult. I'm working my way through each of your questions, but please don't take my answers as being dismissive.Ok turns out, my firewall has a HTTP scanning module.  It has been on for a year without any problems at all.  Seems that an update to it over the last week has wrecked havoc on some of my network devices using port 80 and 443.  Once I turned it off the iOS devices worked with no problem.  Cisco is aware of the problem and are seeing if it is isolated or something that effects everyone with the device.  Thank you for all your help!@cawas I assume @Pacifika already has iTunes and the iDevice in Sync. This is just a matter of rearranging them so new space will be created. It's true that if you rearrange in the device (by creating an empty page) new things will fit and appear. But there's a limit to the number of items Folders can have, a limit of Folders per page and a limit of pages. :) (A folder can have 12 items, 16 folders per page, 11 pages == 2112 visible apps? (plus 4 on the dock). Maybe i'm off but that's the idea. Now @pacifika sure has a lot of stuff! :)in order to "flush" just issue a: ipfw -q flush, no need to reboot.wait, what? does it even record such history? I don't see that on my iphone.133t self-styled hackerz aren't limited to kids who spend many days in the principal's office...Or there could be Windows-borne malware that is trying to do something to the partition table while bootcamped.I would **guess** this has been IMEI blocked through the carrier.Yeah, the numbers are probably right. But I guess Pacifica   reached less than 300 apps, with just a few folders, which is already a lot. Once you get to 2112 then you have to either delete, jailbreak or *spotlight search* for the app. Still I insist - iTunes is not the only way to bring it back.I agree that students can indeed be silently malicious, but this just doesn't strike me as deliberately induced failure. I know my clientele, and in our case the students are either overtly (and clumsily) malicious, or just "normal" computer users. Also, the user on each machine has been inconvenienced by losing access to their documents for days at a stretch (We have yet to map user documents from these Macs to network shares.)As for Windows malaware, also a possibility. We do run antivirus on all Windows machines (including the Bootcamped Macs) in the district (Avast, network managed) and  there have been no warnings on any of the Bootcamped Macs. Also, because teachers and users run with limited privileges, the worst "viruses" we see are rouge antivirus programs that run only with the limited privileges of the user that was duped into installing the program. All we have to do to remove said rouge malware is delete the user's local account and let it rebuild on next login.Excellent, that gets me nearly what I want. (After I scan the messages, I still need to move them out of the special junk folder to somewhere else, but this is a different problem.)try AirVideo http://www.inmethod.com/air-video, they have a free version, you can use in windows or mac, any video file, they support a lot of them.Martin is correct, no need to reboot. If you're obsessive compulsive like me, on OS X 10.6.x you can go to System Preferences->Security->Firewall (rightmost tab) and turn it off then on. You'll may be prompted for Administrator password.Well, that did not work.it deleted the English kb ok, but NOT

Also, it sounds like you have something else going on.  Are you running any VMs?  Lots of open applications?  Are you sure it's a memory issue?  Maybe CPU bottleneck?  Disk I/O?Someone on Quora (http://www.quora.com/Is-Google-Chrome-MacBook-friendly/answer/Akshay-Biloliker) just tipped me to FlashFrozen (http://flashfrozen.net/), which is a menubar util that monitors how much CPU Flash is using on your system and will kill it system wide as needed.  Hopefully this will help with battery life (& system heat!)you're right!I am running mysql with huge queries.

Yesterday it told me I had to change my passcode, and it won't let me change back to an old one - it says "This passcode has been used too recently".  This may be enforced through some setting required by my company.  But I have a hard enough time remember my new computer password!

Windows 7 is a Microsoft product.iTunes is an Apple product.@AliBZ: Is the "Swap outs" count in Activity Monitor climbing?  That's the best indicator I know of that the system is really out of useable RAM (and having to swap memory contents out to disk to make room).  Note that "Page ins" are not a useful indicator, as they'll climb every time a program is launched from disk (unless it happens to be already in inactive RAM).Perfect. Thanks!Thanks!

To be pedantic:  you specified Hour = 5, but no Minute, so it runs every minute from 5:00 to 5:59.  If you were awake during that time period and using the machine, not only would it restart on you but it'd steal focus once a minute while running.

Did you check this?I'd be curious to see disadvantages also in the answers.@Negrino although you're correct, I still insist that the advantages of Gigabit over 100Megabit Eth (or 10!) and FW800 over 400 (and USB 1/2) is very obvious. You're right tho' that FW400 can sustain better throughput, but a clean USB2.0 bus is "faster" than FW400 in some scenarios (small files, as you correctly described, versus a huge file, where FW400 will maintain better overall speed -> tested by me).@Negrino also I was confused about the Ethernet, I instantly thought about 10 Mbits, not sure why I "skipped" 100) ;)A screenshot of something not being found?+1, great tip, but it is not working for my language, which is Lithuanian.

Didn't come up in a Google search, which is odd...The reason it works in Xubuntu may just be that the filesystem uses the same form as the terminal interface.  If you do `ls N* | xxd` in Xubuntu, does it give composed or decomposed characters?Assuming that Xubuntu stores the filename in composed form, try running the command `touch $'Na\xcc\x88ytto\xcc\x88kuva.png'` and see what happens -- my guess is it'll create a new file with a very very similar name.According to this WD forum thread, it is just a login item removable from the Users sysprefs pane. http://community.wdc.com/t5/External-Drives-for-Mac/WD-Quick-view-icon/m-p/103248It does give them in composed form when looking at the same file (though I don't know if VMWare Fusion does its own magic in between, nor if it is even the case). Using the command you provided didn't create a new file, it just touched the original. But if I'm working in a folder inside xubuntu's filesystem, it *does* create a different file.This will certainly work, but it's less than ideal to have to reconfigure every shortcut, especially since not all apps obey SysPrefs-configured shortcuts.+1 for free and open!I was thinking about the same thing myself, plus wanting AT&T pre and postpaid comparedTumbleweed.....Why not just set your phone on vibrate so you can feel it?What kind of downloads?certainly a good idea.

If not, I don't even think you would see a difference between 32 and 64 bit OS's.Thanks, I updated the question a little bit in order to improve it. Can you make some recommandations regarding different formats and settings for these formats?6 years old? I suppose important changes could happen during these years.Which is why I gave the date however I suspect the compression ratios will still be in the same sort of range about 60%In lossless the sound quality is the same as the original so there is no ranking like you suggest. There is one possible by sizeIf you replace MacFUSE & Cyberduck with Transmit.app, then you're my guy :)Just dont update every time thenWhich is based on EclipseIs the TV volume all the way up? Is the MBAir volume all the way up? Or both?If you're set on finding the application your friend used, and you don't see it here, you could flag your post and ask a mod to move it to the [TeX StackExchange Site](http://tex.stackexchange.com/) :).Replace your hard drive with an SSD ;)I've had a lot of LastName/First name problems with this too. (As google has them "the other way around" and sometimes you get duplicates. Always keep a backup just in case something goes wrong and you have to start over.You can also sync the Mac OS X address book with Google. Start the address book and go to Preferences ? Accounts ? On My Mac ? Account Information and check "Sync with Google".@Martin "this" is Google Sync via Exchange, via Address book or contacts sync in general?Thanks but is it faster than the alternatives mentioned above?@Martin, well, the iTunes version is the same as the Address Book version. At least, I think (I'll try to check tonight). So if it didn't work with Address Book, it might not work with iTunes for you. Then again, it depends when you tried it, I believe they made some change along the way. Like only syncing the "my contacts" part and not the entire directory.A couple hours for what? A single file? A handful? 500? Either way, some things just take time to do.You know you can add PDF files to iBook, right?Do you have any other drives (external) connected? Like a Time Machine, a Clone or something?A single 90 minute movie. I'm aware it takes considerable time but theres no harm in trying to optimise :-)I've tried SoundSource several times now, it doesn't persist for me on 10.6.4, 10.6.5 or 10.6.6.In the "set up an Exchange account" link, on the last picture, it shows "mail, contacts, calendar", but mine shows "mails, calendar, notes". Also, actually, I have an iPod 4G (isn't it the same system?), and I use it with linux, not mac osx.I'm curious, what cydia apps are you talking about? I couldn't find any. Maybe with the names, I'll be able to find them. @VxJasonxV: Those apps you mention work only in the U.S., but the world continues after the "rio grande". 

I need an app that allow me to download not only maps but satellite photos (like the ones in Google maps). I live in a rural area with no 3g coverage, and want to use the pictures with the GPS data (usually from dirt roads and bicycle paths that doesn't appear on any map) 
Funny. The GPS works when outside, where there's no WIFI, but Google Maps wBy extensions, do you mean Kernel Extensions? "kexts"?Replacing your hard drive with an SSD is an excellent way to improve boot time, but an even better method: don't boot. Put your system to sleep instead of shutting down.@Tom Are you sure you selected `Exchange`? If I recall correctly, "mails, calendar, notes" is when you use the `Gmail`-type account.Seems to be normal. Happens on all MBPs I have ever used. Bad anodisation I suppose.In a situation like this, I just set up an automatic queue of some sort on a spare Mac, hit "Run", and then walk away until it's done or an error occurs that requires management.Uhm, how do you do that? MBP plugs have no earth pin.Yea, not only do I want the server stuff but I also want to do general computing on it. Day to day stuff whilst still running the server service in the background.actually, I had set up this when I bought the device. If I cancel the configuration and go with `Exchange` what will change? Will I still be able to edit my calendar on both google and ipod, and have them synchronized?@tom yes, the Exchange setup also allows you to edit your calendarWow, I did not know they were developing a version for OS X! Going to try it out now. Thanks!vim helped me edit a 512MB+ text file. I wish there was something like EM Editor (http://www.emeditor.com/) for Mac.Well, when I'm at work, I do have a Time Machine active, but when I posted this, I didn't have any other drives connected, except my synced iDisk.Great! Thanks. I'll accept when we get it, try it and confirm.Either will work: the only difference is that Server has additional services preinstalled. It will work great as a desktop general-computing machine.it worked fine =Dby the way, I thought I had lost my notes for a second, as they vanished from my ipod. But a brief search shows that they are on my gmail with the tag "Notes". I would like they still sync also.@tom the only way for you to get the note back, is to create a `Gmail`-type account (name it "notes" or whatever) and only active the note part (not the caledar, nor the mails). Note sync is not available with the Exchange setup.Actually they do, see the post by mspasov below. The "small" plug does not have an earth pin, but the extension cord does (EU). The outer pins on the MagSafe plug are ground. On the actual power supply, the large metal knob is what connects to the power cord ground when available.That wasn't quite it, but it gave me enough of a clue to find the solution. Turns out I just needed to change Remote Computer Authentication in the Security prefs pane to 'Always connect, even if authentication fails' and I'm able to connect again. Dunno why I never thought to have a rummage round the prefs dialog!These points cover different areas and need to be different questionsThat startup article is rather out of date as some parts e.g.  mach_init and init processes are now not used see Apple's doc http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Articles/BootProcess.htmlIs this expected to change? I want to attract more beta testers for an app by giving them more incentives. Will this be a good one? 1 year or a lifetime of free upgrades.Just a note so new users don't get confused: Web sharing is off by default, so it won't be checked in the first place. Also, if you do want to use web sharing, you can change the port Apache uses by changing the file /etc/apache2/httpd.confGreat answer, thanks very much for this. @Sam - I know for Apps you can choose 'transfer purchases' (when you right click on your device) to sync downloaded apps to your Mac. Might be worth trying for music as well.Thank you very much :)NICE! I didn't know about this one at all! +1Those questions are impossible to answer, but since Apple's current formula for success doesn't require paid upgrades, then I highly doubt it. At the same time, there other ways to attract beta testers.Nope I didn't...Good idea, but didn't install on my Mac, not sure why.Score! Can it do audio too, or is that a separate app?Charles.app is a must tool for HTTP introspection but +1 to @mark from me!Or hold down **v** after the chime.This question needs either a screen shot or more information.@nuc: I haven't hit a case where those two didn't cover me yet. But when I do, [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) will be bought for sure. :)thank you for reply :)Yep. Both turned all the way up.Do you know if this supports some kind of completion key?It's certainly strange, could you please quickly create another user, log in and see if the new user exhibits the same behavior?Mmmm. I don't entirely remember. IIRC I used Soundflower for streaming computer audio.I did read a workaround regarding PDFs and GoodReader. I believe it was something about using the "PDF Reflow" feature, which turns it into text, which can be autoscrolled. Worthless if you're reading a PDF with significant style or photos, but worth a try otherwise!Xcode 4 detects Xcode 3 and renames Development folder to Development-old I don't think it's possible to "stack" them, as you can have both at the same time.My mother has this exact machine and I put the MAX Ram (4gb AFAICR) and it was a "new" machine. Seriously. Try that, it's cheap. And get a big screen. If you're changing machines, see the other answers, good points there. Bear in mind that *any* recent apple hardware will be 'faster' and more 'responsive' that your Mini in its current state.Martin, you're correct. I should have made clear that it was "stacking" of Xcode 3 installs. I've amended my answer for clarity.Wireshark is too low level for this imho. It's better to use Charles proxy or browser specific plugins (Firebug in Firefox, or Chrome dev tools in Chrome, or Safari dev tools).@Jm2.me make sure you create a new user (with admin rights) BEFORE doing any of this. If you have problems with the old account, you might be unable to log in.It seems to be very frequent with the unibody laptops, though.I own a unibody mac and manage 50 of them where I work, and haven't got, or heard of anyone getting, a shock from any of them or from any of the rest of the 1200 machines I manage. So it might be frequent but it clearly isn't "every machine" so the question still stands "is it normal behaviour" imho.Like what? I'm using paid advertising now.Thanks ! A lot of podcasts don't show significant differences between the 2 views (No cover, no description) so I didn't noticed that it was actually 2 different views !Very much agree with Mr. Marconcini, it is a good idea to have an admin user with a user folder on the boot partition if you normally have users on a second partition. I also have users on a separate partition and my setup seems to match ughoavgfh's.What I mean is that there are other ways to read news and keep updated. Have you tried, for instance, [readitlater](http://readitlaterlist.com/)?@Martin I completely agree with increasing redundancy backups up to a point. But don't forget google contacts already have a time machine backup for some time now. You can recover data on it from any given time. It's pretty remarkable.You can run the Server editions of OS X on any Mac without problems, but you are correct that the Xserve (no longer sold) and the Mac Pro will be speediest.Also for a more OSX feel look at Aquamacs <http://aquamacs.org/>what type of tagging you want? to correct Mp3 ID3 tag?Yes. But it would be awesome to be able to edit tags for any other format too (e.g. FLAC).so ckeck this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10522/identify-and-tag-music-from-itunes-library-under-os-x/10525#10525Indeed it doesn't. It looks like Instapaper is basically the same thing. And I see where your urge from doing that comes from. I've tried doing the same with RSS readers, including google's, but I could never keep on. One day was enough for late news and way too much crap. I assume if you have a good list of RSS it might work, but I decided to just reach for other means. When I want to read news, I google for them, read around anywhere. And I get some feeds on email. That's about it. So, I keep my vote up (not like I could easily remove it anyway) and my wish to you for good luck! :P@navitronic `ctrl+space` It does generate a dropdown, though (which you can cycle with the shortcut).Thanks for your reply. Hopefully there are those navigation buttons on the top left of google maps. Those buttons are responding to clicks, so I'm able to navigate "old-fashinoned" way, but that's more than nothing :-)+1 for "you only want to do the iMac disassembly once"Buttons work but the canvas doesn't? Hmm, that's really interesting. I didn't think that'd be the case. Given that widgets are supposed to be freely moveable, I'm fairly confident in saying that the "old-fashioned way" is as good as you're going to get from within a WebClip widget.Oh, and what adapter are you using? Given that a MBAir doesn't have an HDMI jack.This doesn't sound like something Apple would let you do - has the iPad been jailbroken yet?@Ma This site is about Apple hardware and software. This is on-topic. please seethe FAQs for more info.Thanks for details. From reading your answer it seems, if I want to leave original drive and optical disk alone, the only way to install SSD is in the Data Doubler which I don't what it is. I thought there would be exansion slot to just install SSD there.Proxy icons are like the best thing ever. +1!Digest is a great in app add-on for this app.http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1491/alternative-way-to-move-windows-around-screenhttp://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-xEven better: If you type `killall Dock` in Terminal, without hitting enter, do this, then go back to Terminal and hit enter, the Dock is quit while the window is minimizing, leaving it in its animated state until next time you minimize it.Anything can be added to the Finder's toolbar. Mine contains a couple of applications and my trash.Apple's display port -> HDMI adapterThat is the default when staying on the same hard drive. Use option to copy on the same drive, and command and option to create an alias.Paul, one more reason for you to consider my answer! ;)@JFW it depends if the app has been programmed to do it so. For instance, Google Chrome work with this. Finder, iTunes and Safari doesn't. Before anyone says so, TextEdit and Terminal are default to full screen without <kbd>shift</kbd>. Bottom line, this is not a good answer as it's far from being standardized enough through apps.this would be perfect if it was assigned to shift+click.Yes, I did try to run that command, several times. It doesn't seem to have any effect. I also looked at Default Apps. Nothing really looked out of the ordinary. This started happening immediately after I got my MacBook Pro less than a week ago. I installed my typical foray of apps, but nothing that isn't mainstream (iWork, Photoshop, etc.). I got Xcode 4 from ADC, not the App Store. It seems to happen for every single file type.jailbreaking turns the iOS in what it should be from beginning - I doubt there's anyone who believes Jobs uses iOS with all those restrictions.This is awesome.OS X starting from 10.6.5 can also read/write/format on ExFAT. It's pretty much the same thing as FAT32 without the 4GB file limit.@Lucas this is something I have to investigate, especially because it happens on different accounts. Let me get back to you :)@Loic can Windows read/write/format to that as well?@A M nope, the iMac, as big as it looks, it has no room to spare, so you'd have to sacrifice the Optical Drive. Given the benefits of SSD, I DO recommend that you upgrade your internal drive, which you can always use as an external one with a case via USB or FW or similar. The speed bonus is amazing :)I have two followup questions: 

1) Will TRIM work out-of-box or does this require a first-party drive?
2) Does the OS install any differently to an SSD or can I mirror my existing drive?Thanks for your reply. Model is iPhone 4 (MC603X/A). Software is V 4.2.1 (8C148). Internet is 802.11g.Windows 7, at least, can. Probably also Vista and maybe XP SP3.I skipped iMovie and just exported from MPEG Stremclip using the x264 codec.  Apparently there's much info regarding Apple's implementation of H.264 gamma to not even consider using it...thanks anyway!Thank you. :) Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide, perhaps even Screen Sharing/SSH access at some point if you want to poke around.I already have the battery percentage turned on.  But when it is charging it won't show.  I don't want to unplug just to see the percentage and plug it in again.  A lot of your answers are "I think"... when the question is answered, nobody else really bother to answer again, at least in the near future.Textmate "quite there yet"? Seriously? I suggest you go back and look again ;)Thanks for the links, to the desktop management related questions, but I am not really interested in moving windows, just making them snap together.Thanks, but perhaps it is not much more convenient than using a dedicate application?Actually I enjoy TextMate much more than Notepad++. Weird!As Matthew is pointing out in his answer, just tell us what you miss in TextMate or TextWrangler that you would like to find in your mac text editor.Didn't work for me :(That's not an option. I need it remapped.I'm not sure whether this question would be better on StackOverflow or not. Did you search there?@Lucas Yeah, let's hope someone more clever finds something ;)That's clear. The app right now doesn't need camera or localization - only an internet connection is needed. And that'll be true for most of my coming projects.@mseo then an **iPod Touch** would be perfect for you.I've changed my accepted answer to this because the original answer from mankoff stopped working.Thanks for the link.  This just happens to be a link that I did not find with Google :)  I will look into this tonight to see if I can get the USB install to work.
On a side note, I have this exact question on several forums and will update all of them if/when I find a solution.I updated my answer to remove the 'i Thinks', I wrote those because I am not beside my iPad right now. Even without the actual percentage, it should show up a visual representation of how much it has charged. But your main issue is that your computer does not send enough power over USB to charge the iPad.What is is that you want us to answer? Please edit your question to clarify.Why is is not an option?@Juan: In what way? Did you upgrade your OS?Actually, I think Programmers (SE) would be more appropriate, but since there are already reasonable answers here, I vote to keep this here.is the "apple videos app" the [iMovie for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8)?And soundhound has been around for quite longer I believe. It used to be called **midomi**.+1 great ideas!I'd love to see an idea which works offline and without jailbreaking.He already mentioned he did use that.by the way, keeping it awake with the lid closed is highly unadvised as it may heat up too much and damage it. that's why it doesn't have any default way to do it. with that in mind, InsomniaX is the answer.I'm currently working with the IT department to see why the phone demanded a new passcode; they don't seem to think it's a policy yet...@CajunLuke Cool thanks, good to know.  I'll probably keep at least one drive formatted in ExFAT for cross compatibility without the 4GB limit from now on.@KatieK it's right on the first page of the link I've sent you, they can't deny it. Seems like it might be easier to go on the jailbreak way! :)You're not missing anything. [Dropbox is missing it](http://www.dropbox.com/help/84).Devs are working *full speed* (sic) on Cloud sync for Things though http://culturedcode.com/status/It's none of those. I use Live HTTP Headers all the time.@Peter - indeed. Wireshark looks pretty hardcore. The tool I'm referring to was a bit more than Live HTTP Headers. It gave a bit more about the request / response, and even let you create requests, but it was really user friendly (and being stand-alone meant that I could use it without Firefox, which was nice for testing small interactions with an API).thanks (also see my comment to Peter).@orokusaki: take a look at Charles proxy, it might be what you want. On Windows, there is Fiddler proxy that does the same.Why would TextMate stop being stable in Lion?hmm... weird for sureDon't rely on Things development cycle. Notoriously slow.On the tiny aluminium wireless keyboard - fn + backspace gives you del. fn + alt + backspace will delete the whole next word in that case.My only response is. There's lots of tools that exist like this. Why do you need the *exact specific one* that you saw being used? Was there some "killer feature" that none of the other apps have?I am closing this question because there are too many different things being asked. Please post new questions for each distinct question you're asking.Looks great but it looks like there's no recurring task feature...Toodledo is ok, but I really don't like their web UI...@BrianKim: I agree that TD's UI isn't ideal, but there are worse out there, and for a web-based system, it's still very useful. I think it would be easy to dismiss all of the apps in the responses for one reason or another, but you'll have to try some of them for a little while each before settling on one. I did. It was a real drag moving content from one to another, but now I've been working with ToodleDo longer than any other system I've used.@cawas, no. It's just called,"videos".  It comes pre-installed on iPads and iPod touches. (It doesn't exist on the iPhone for some reason - it's embedded in the iPod app there.)  It's where iTunes puts movies, tv shows, etc.@Lucas The Screen Sharing would be more to satisfy my curiosity ;) But let's continue investigating a few more days.I actually bought Eye-fi little more than 1 year ago and I don't know where it is and never used it! But I doubt even that would be able to sync as I described. I was hoping for a jailbroken solution. But thanks for giving a shot and reminding me of eye.fi!Understood. To your knowledge, is there anything else that controls the display of this context menu?You don't need to use the Eye-Fi card, all you need to do is register and then download the iPhone app. This app is the most promising of the lot for me.@Loic I think it's al about the community, rather than the pre-defined site subject. All those divisions are too patronizing to me - I prefer a world with border free countries. And sorry for going too far in the analogy! :PYes, the files themselves contain most of the metadata, but some of it (most notably the star ratings, which I've put a lot of time into) is in the database file itself, not attached to the song files.Textmate was released when Tiger was the dominant operating system. Almost 5-6 years ago. There seems to be a lot of changes with how applications can behave in Lion. It might remain how its always been, but this was just an exercise in looking for alternatives.yea, i know that we can add pdf files to iBooks, but it wud look like a pdf and letters would be too small to read :)SleepNow just puts the computer to sleep. That option is available by default in Quicksilver's Extra Scripts plug-in. The original poster asked for a script to force hibernation.thanks for this informationgetflow is quite new, so you never know what will happen in the future...I found the web interface a bit slow and could not stand it. (slow as in too many clicks needed)Toodledo has been around for a long time and many apps use Toodledo as a sync hub in the cloud, e.g.  Awsome note (http://www.bridworks.com/anote/en/main/index.php)Odd in my experience these do get reinstalleddoesnt work anymore in the most recent stable version...I have had to explicitly exclude those - as they are not files that TM deals with well as any minor change means a very large new file is copied over.http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7488/mac-book-pro-can-i-plug-two-external-monitors-inI have to mention that the this is not a duplicate of the linked question, this one is not about adding an USB display drivers, it is just if the hardware graphics card from MacBook supports it.I didn't see anything about USB in the question.Personally, I think your question is better phrased, but I still think the two should be combined as they are the same question: MacBook Pro + 2 external monitors.This looks interesting but it is quite expensive.Thanks for the pointer! I've been using that widget for awhile now. What I'm looking for is something that I can access via Quicksilver.Zdravei, try using Keyboard Layout editor like [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele).Yes, that's why I added the price information. There is no way to attach more than one digital monitor (and get a good picture) without costly hardware or using an external video card (in our case it's ruled out in the question).@Philip: I don't have a clear idea, but it does seem to coincide with some upgrades to the OS. I had added some comments on [mankoff](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2488/start-stop-internet-sharing-from-a-script/2501#2501)'s answer since January, but only now I had a chance to investigate a bit more the issue and modify my scripts to use your solution instead.@Tim I added a solution for Quicksilver@Juan: Just be forewarned that if Apple changes the layout of Systems Preferences and the Sharing pane with an upgrade, then my script has the real potential break as well because GUI scripting relies on very strict parameters.Thanks for your answer, I'll try that but am not hopeful. I'm assuming there are no caches that would contain the data I'm looking for (since the phone hasn't been restarted)TextMate bracket selection can be done when you're in a bracketed section. [See this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1278700/bracket-highlighting-in-textmate-javascript).The other feature isn't "variable highlighting" it's "show all matches for current selection". Outside of the Find All box I don't think there's a way to do this in TextMate.No recurring task...Instead of Quicksilver, why dont you try [Alfred.app](http://www.alfredapp.com)? It provides basic system commands such as sleep, trash, logout etc, you can customize it pretty easily and its full of nifty features!My pet theory is that Mail.app defines the type of the account by its domain name and not by the mail server address. Is this affecting the account somehow?Why you use command for dragging them? Try to just drag them.. :)In every Mac site I've found, it shows command-drag to move files, option-drag to copy files. I wonder why...There is a [guide](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2514) on apple.com with some main differences from windows environment, while some of them apply if you come from linux as well. It might be a good idea to check them out!@MIDoubleKO There is no such thing as Cut or cmd+x on Mac OS X!But this will not delete .Trash on mounted media/network volumes.Thats a better solution though :)I'm talking about the notebook's display, but that's helpful for future concerns, thanks.He probably meant cmd-c and and cmd-v to copy files.+1 Good article.@MIDoubleKO I apologize then.. :)Thanks for the detailed explanation.I've looked at this a few months ago, but it seems that they recently added web app, ipad app and etc. I'll give this a second try...My main devices for using GTD app are Mac and iPad. Toodledo is web and iPhone. Yes there are many todo apps that use Toodledo for syncing but haven't found a really good one that's on Mac and iPad as well. Having web app is a plus but I prefer native app on Mac. I guess that leaves me with only OmniFocus...We used to image that way. If you get more than a couple Macs at a time, this is very time-consuming (and therefore expensive). mspasov's suggestion is more reasonable for a large deployment, although the upfront cost can be more substantial, if you don't have an available machine to run ARD on. Your method is better suited for an organization that only deploys a few machines a year.@Ben: Duly noted. Thanks for the info.@nuc: "Is this affecting the account somehow?" Not that I can tell, but I'm wanting to understand the differences, if any.I do have stacked installs. I'll try doing the full uninstall and see what I get. If this works I'll accept this answer.@EmmyS You're welcome.@robsoft, I think you all should really consider taking a look at my [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/395/how-can-i-get-files-into-my-dropbox-from-my-ipad/10715#10715)! :P@nuc - cmd-x works just fine inside applications on my Mac - I can cut text, pieces of images, etc. Seems kind of silly that they'd implement all the other standard keyboard shortcuts (cmd+c for copy; cmd+v for paste) but not cmd-x...@MIDoubleKO I guess there must be a reason for that decision! After all, according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste#History) Apple "widely popularized the computer-based cut-and-paste paradigm through the Lisa (1981) and Macintosh (1984) operating systems and applications."Its quite similar to what spotlight does. I wish it showed more than a line, like entries from the thesaurus.+1 because you made me sit down and figure out *why* Apple left out the standard commands and what to do about it.@nuc: AIUI the reason Finder doesn't implement cut is that on the Mac, if you cut something it vanishes (i.e. moves to the clipboard) immediately.  So if you cut some files, then forget to paste them before cutting something else, they'd just silently vanish.Really? Once you're logged in, it's just as simple as entering a task in the top bar and clicking add. I sign in with my Google account, so that's very simple too. What part are you finding slow?I prefer it to Spotlight as Spotlight often doesn't even show the full line. Moreover, here you have several answers which helps when you're not sure about the typo. But I understand your needs. As the developer is actively enhancing the tool, it could be a suggestion for a future improvement.Isn't it Ctrl+Cmd+D ? It's how it works here at least. And you don't have to select the word, just put the mouse on it (which you can move afterwards while still holding Cmd+Ctrl)Thanks for sharing this!Good catch. Editing now. Thank you.Did you recently upgrade the firmware on your touch, say to 4.3?I updated a few weeks ago but it was working fine after thatThat's odd. Is the connector at the bottom bent? Does wiggling it while docked help?I stuck it in another older IP90 and it worked fine.  So then I blew it and the IP90 out with compressed air and now it works.  I'm not convinced it was the air though, we will see if it returns.  Thanks.You're quite welcome.

I also spoke to it's developer and he says he cannot find a way to switch to bluetooth on call answer either :/Interesting, I will check that out, thanksShame on me for not noticing. :)Thanks for digging up the `-N` argument, that's what I was looking for. The creation/removal of the destination directory I can work around in a script.@Mike You're welcome.very intriguing, and valid, question!I do not have an answer for this either. But I guess you can create tiny applescripts, and bind them to keyboard shortcuts.Tried that aswell - as far as I can see it only seems to scroll to the end of the current page and doesn't continue to the next page...unless I am doing something wrong.FYI if it helps, it appears that the Bulgarian keyboard layout uses ` for the dead key instead of the single quote Bulgarian - Phonetic uses.You might be missing the intent of list views like what is presented in Spotlight. List views are provided by the OS as an easy way to navigate a lot of information in a small space and by extension provide easy navigation to content a user needs. While there are apps that step out of that mold, and Apple doesn't do anything to stop them, it's rare to find devs that are willing to step out of the UI guidelines for them and provide what you are looking for. Asking for it in a specific *type* of app will make your search even harder. I'm not saying it will be impossible, but it won't be easy.Don't you have free long distance on your phone? Or is that a US-centric assumption?Great feature, but i wish it worked in chrome/firefox.there, i think my question is better framed now.Alfred is a cool app. I might just ditch LaunchBar for it one of these days.@c0smikdebris I never used LaunchBar but I'm a really happy Alfred's customer (I bought the Powerpack, but the free version is already really cool). No, I don't work for them, I'm just one among many happy users :) Just give it a try and you won't uninstall it ;)For Chrome, you can try https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcojaSee, that's the kind of thing that makes me really scratch my head when people extoll the virtues of the Mac UI. In my mind, an application's menu bar belongs with the application. If the application is displayed on a second monitor, the menubar should display on the second monitor as well. It should not be integrated into the OS to such a degree that all configuration, preferences, etc. that you work with for an application would be happening on a different monitor than you are actually viewing the application on.SecondBar IS a hack - it's not perfect, because the menubar is duplicating what's on the main monitor. So if I have Thunderbird open in my first monitor, and Chrome open in my second monitor, the way I'd expect it to work (and the way it works in every other OS I've worked with) is that the menubar for Thunderbird is available in the first monitor, and the menubar for Chrome is available in the second monitor.What SecondBar does is duplicates the menubar for the *active* application. So if I have Thunderbird open in 1 and Chrome open in 2, and Chrome is my "active" application, I see the menubar for Chrome in both monitors. It's better than nothing, because at least I don't have to change monitors to access the menubar for Chrome, but I do have to switch to deal with any dialogs. That's just ludicrous design as far as I'm concerned. 

(Didn't mean to turn this into a rant against Macs; I'm just finding it very frustrating after Linux, which lets me configure all these things however I want.)"In my mind, an application's menu bar belongs with the application." This is true. However, in Mac OS X, the desktop *spans all monitors*. You cannot say "if the application is displayed on a second monitor" because an application can have multiple windows. Try opening two windows in Safari, put one in one monitor and one in the other. How does the OS know which "window" the application is in? It doesn't care, it only cares which monitor you made default by placing the menu bar."the way I'd expect it to work (and the way it works in every other OS I've worked with)" -- every other OS you've worked with probably has multiple menu bars *attached to each application window*. Mac OS has always been designed with the concept of a single menu bar *for all applications* attached to the main monitor.I'm using Dictionary Lookup:(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipdjaafajlfiopcppipdinmcjbcpofhd). Best dictionary extension IMO."There are many advantages to a single menu approach". And there are just as many disadvantages, which become more and more obvious as people start to work with multiple monitors. I understand your point, I just think that an OS that touts itself as so user-friendly and well designed should give me the option of how I want my menubars to behave if I have multiple monitors.Having menu bars attached to windows would break application-centric design of MacOS. You could no longer have an application open with no document windows. If you allowed users a choice, you would have to design applications from the ground up to target two different modes: application-centric, or window-centric. This would double the complexity of the operating system, and double users' confusion.If you're interested in more discussion on this topic, see this Ars Technica forum: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=248668Is there any reasonably safe way to jailbreak an iPhone and install a SMS-blocking app?It's commonly called the "lozenge".There is no way you would run a production server on desktop hardware.Why not? macminicolo.net does just fine (and, true to their name, they run everything on Mac minis). It's not like server hardware is different or special. Maybe you've customized it for more RAM or disk space or many cores or one very fast core depending on intended workloads, but for **most people**, a desktop-class machine (or even a laptop) will work great as a server. When you reach the point where it won't *you'll know*, and you can get a mess of servers customized to fit your particular needs.I couldn't find the eyefi card and I don't think they allow anyone to register - just customers who have the card.

Thanks!@ghoppe - it could, but I am not at all used to Bulgarian standard layout, just the Bulgarian phonetic. Thanks though!Could you explain why it 'should be better' than Knox?It's probably worth mentioning it's built on FileVault which is part of OS X. Knox adds things like ease of use and scheduling of volumes for backup (to say your Dropbox account).Iam also curious about thatiKeepass is not available in other countries other than Canada and USA, 1Password is, and I do know it has a notes feature but not very practical, it also caused me to lose some note I was editing when a phone call came up.Codebook does seem like a very good app although without a proper way to get those notes into plain text from the sqlite db it's doesn't solve much.I'm in Canada. No free long distance on the plan that I've got.Are you sure MagicDial would work? I'm not trying to use my iPhone to dial a different phone, I'm trying to insert keypresses while on a call with my iPhone. I could only imagine this working if I put my iPhone into Speaker mode, and the keypresses were loud enough for the iPhone's microphone to pick up@melvin 1password is the midterm between keepass and lastpass. I prefer the later, but you dont want everything in the cloud. and i agree. to me, the lack of offline backups is the worst aspect of lastpass. I'm surprised with ikeepass restriction, tho. I'll add the other option and hope it doesn't have same restrictions.this is perfect. you could also have answered in the same way you'd answer any question, without saying "my solution was". it's all fine! ;)@jay you're right. I'm not sure what I was thinking! it still may work even if you turn the speaker off and reduce the volume as it may be possible to send sound out to a caller. but i'm not sure it will.If it's a folder at the root of a volume, then the parent folder is the volume itself.  What're the permissions on that?  Also, the Finder doesn't always show all permissions -- try from Terminal with `ls -leOd ` and then drag the folder and the volume onto the Terminal window before pressing return.It is also possible to copy the password to then paste it.Awesome, rechargeable is even better!I have already changed the settings using the command line, and now Time Machine is backing up files every 2 hours, instead of every hour as it does by default.I did submit a ticket - no response.

Are they named differently? Are the contents different?Sorry, I wasn't clear; the /Applications symlink points to (roughly) /var/stash/Applications.skjSFs but there's also an older /Applications.9dsaf (I'm not looking right at them, so the random parts are different).Which application blocks the Mac as this should be very unusualI think it is an utility that replaces some text when I enter it. The point is another one, though; what I described could happen also when I shut down the Mac, and I switch it on right when Time Machine should back up the files. What I want to do is to avoid it does it when the Mac just restarted. The scenario I described is simply that I sometimes reset the Mac while I am doing something urgent and I would like to restart working on it without Time Machine makes the Mac slower.Works on my 3rd gen, for what it's worth.

While I agree that there is seemingly no reason to change the system font color, the person didn't ask for your opinion on whether or not he should.@Mark There's a saying that reads: "For tastes, that's why color was invented" (a rough translation from spanish). It's a perfectly reasonable idea wanting to experiment and change the theme. OS X's default theme is not the "final" word in how things should be and I can see places where I'd change a lot of things, especially after more than seven years using it.

Hence, no DRM issue. All I meant by my statement was that with about 10 lines of code, you could achieve the same type of behavior in OS X.I see, so the Win stuff quits itself. Makes sense. Yeah, it would be great to see them take full advantage of Cocoa..Thats why I asked how long you left it charging (I never had a chance to write an actual answer).

For example: JailBreak is not something I want to do on 4.3.1 (as far as i know it's not yet released) so iPhone Explorer won't work for me. TO restore from unencrypted backup is something I've done milion years ago so not going to help.it is the funniest in-built utilite ever :) thanks!LOL, true, and it wasn't even intended originally to detect line-in versus internal microphone.  I'm just glad it's available for free as part of the OS X.Thanks, brilliant answer. And maybe you know, could I change those values in Logic?@NR4TR I don't have Logic, but it's in the manual - yes you can. I'll edit my answer.Did you jailbreak your phone?That's perfect.  Are they going to be sold anywhere?@MadBoy and I'm not saying it's ultimate and perfect help too. But you seemed to be ignoring the other attempts. My two favorites are the 2nd and 4th. Ideally I would give the "magic tool" and with that in hand it would be the simplest way. But I couldn't go through all research needed and while nobody can help us with that, I'm afraid you're stuck with DIY or wiping. :|sounds like something to try, thanks for the link.I should have mentioned this one, already have it. Excellent recommendation.Thanks. I'll have to check this out.I've heard of this, but haven't looked considering I'm interested in iPad/iPhone apps.Are you allowed by your employer to have the data (i.e. mail) on external systems?I suspect iPhone here as on my Mac the Google calendar events are OK and the Iphone has a history of calendar issues,Thank you.  So it really like a menu that lets you switch between the two input languages.What exactly do you mean by "WMV embeds"?I did not jailbreak, but considering doing it just to get some shell access to check the processes running.Yeah, makes sense, but how can I find which app is the faulty one? iStat only shows total processor load and active processes, not how much they drain. I guess I need something like Activity Monitor in OS X.Makes sense, but actually, even when a (non-Apple) app have not been started, it may exist as a process. Through iStat, I have seen app processes running that are not in the task switcher (requires you to start the app and then close it to get rid of).Check your current and new user group memberships, using the `id` command.Looks like I've answered my own question - the current version of Glims seems to do this. I was hoping for something more basic, but if it works, I'm happy.
Any other comments are welcome, though.Didn't know that you can request this! +1I start with the most recent (and most likely) to have gone bad.just out of curiosity: why?Plus it looks much better to *not* have the default ugly apple headphone. At least from my taste point of view. But, @Alan, your worrying is very valid. For sure apple's headset's buttons don't work on HTC and Samsung Androids for anything - nor does the HTC phone work on the mac. I've tried all those. Those buttons are not all that standardized.I have tried a very similar procedure and it wasn't pretty..  I may just do a quick backup and try it tho.  Results coming later today.  :-)Also - I believe single-user mode is cmd+s, not cmd+opt+s.  Wonder when that post was written, I seem to remember it used to be +opt way back when...@Ripper that'd be weird. Perhaps if the app has some sort of Push activated, but if the app is not running, any process that it has or had while it was, should be frozen. You might see some activity, but nothing that should compromise your battery life like that. If that's the case, try removing the app from the device. (You will be later able to add it again when you sync)Are you an administrator of your machine? Is the new user an administrator on the machine? Are the two users members of the same user groups? Would it be possible that the Griffin thing uses any other .plist other than what you removed? Have you tried an app cleaner (like AppZapper or the free alternatives out there?)The main advantage of MonoDevelop is if you want to work with the Mono implementation of the .NET Framework with your iOS or Mac applications, or need to do cross platform development. If you just want to target Mac and iOS then Xcode will do it all for you. FYI, the MonoTouch framework is a commercial license for $300 I believe.I just tested it, and `pbpaste` only works with plain text, rich text, etc. No binary data. See [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3146692/binary-image-data-clipboard-os-x)Thanks for the edit Jeff... was trying to do that myself when you changed it. Never noticed that you could format the keys like that!-1 as it doesn't actually work for the question he asked.Bummer, thought for sure it would work with binary but didn't test (mac is at home, not here at work). Got the StackOverflow urge to post something as fast as I could. Tried to downvote my own answer but I couldn't.  :)Where are my Virtual Machine files located?The easiest for you would be to open VMware Fusion, right click on the virtual machine and select `Show in Finder`Ouch, it would downsize the iPad2 1080p back to 720p on a 27 inch iMac. Judging by the comments on the store I would have to use the 24 Inch stand alone display to get 1080p.The `osascript` approach is nice. But it opens the shell in a new window instead of a new tab.How far away is the router from your bedroom and how many walls are in the way (and what are the walls made out of)?Looks nice! Thanks!Additionally, if you add Control to the screenshot command above, it will screenshot to clipboard and not a file.  I realize that's the opposite of the OPs question, but it never hurts to close the circle.This does work after all! Just make sure you don't omit the `.local` part! (Like I did when I first tried it.)@CajunLuke Distance between router and bedroom is circa 11m, being 4 meters for the width of the main room where the router is and 7/8 meters of corridor to the entrance of the room. Even being at my room's doorstep, almost viewing the capsule at the end of the corridor, the signal is from extremely weak to nonexistent. And as noted, the previous DLink router had no issue at all with the exact same configuration.Oh hells yeah. This is rad -- despite the obvious failure suggested by others.That rocks. You cranked that out pretty quick.Yes, it's a feature. The reason I could think of is that some directories are actually containers (`.app`, `.bundle`, `.kext`) and "merging" by default would be catastrophic.Hmmm. I'd almost suggest you return the Time Capsule as faulty. My dad's time capsule easily reaches 40' (>11m) through several walls and a floor or two. My Airport Extreme has stretched over 75' through a reinforced concrete floor and several walls. The range you are experiencing is absurdly tiny compared to what I've seen and would expect.+1 for the photoshop comment :)or maybe the issue is within google calendars...I think it might be a problem with the network. Ill have to get the account password and talk to AT&T. I've tried the reboot as well. Talking to AT&T is my last hope...next to taking it to the Apple Store. Thank you for the reply.You could trim out the DIR= line, and replace "${DIR}" with a simple ~/Movies/ if you want.iNet is a great iOS app. Nice to see it in the Mac App Store. The interface looks really great from the screenshots.Make sure you're using the hex codes for the characters.The ASCII code for the tab character is 9.I tried swiping. And I tried to email but I have to either be using a Mac or windows. It won't go through. I don't understand :( and how do I check purchase history....sorry.....So i buy a song, and 2 years later want to listen to that song again but have a new iphone and/or computer, have to request it to be downloaded one last time, or pay for it again.Recommend the feature to developers.To view your purchase history, you'll have to be on a computer with iTunes. You will then have to login to your iTunes account (in the iTunes Store), then Choose Store (at the top right of iTunes) then click View My Account. Next in the Account Information window, click Purchase History. and Volia. I suggest you shoot iTunes Customer Support an email via a Mac or PC, they'll get back to you within the day or early next day depending on when you submit the request.Well crap.  This seems to have worked.  I don't know which step I missed last time I tried this, but I can't deny the results.  Thank you!So using dd in the terminal has problems?And I don't need to partition my USB stick or instal yaboot etc?Safari accepts the tab characters entered in that way, but Firefox and Opera seem to not like them.Cool, thanks again. It's a pity that I cannot upvote again :)Hi, Thanks for this suggestion. One question, how safe is gmail? And how safe is Google? Do they read/index emails for searching? Another question I have is regarding POP3, would this mean that all the email on my company server are deleted as part of the process, or are they still there? Thanks again. NiklasJust had the problem happen again, and that command seemed to fix it. Thank you!Dock is Bose SoundDock. IOS is iPhone 4 latest version. I was assuming that maybe apps need to specifically enable sound output through the dock socket and that Voice Memo doesn'tI wouldn't mess around with firmware/bootloaders, personally.  I've just heard from colleagues in the business (I am an Apple-certified tech) that this works well.On the POP 3 settings there is a check box to choose whether or not to leave a copy of the messages on the mail server.  I find it very secure as long as you select force https in the settings.  It's not like Yahoo where accounts get hacked all the time.  Google does save archives but they don't use them for anything unless subpoenaed by a court of law.@vxjasonxv Thank you for your proposal :)Belongs on http://superuser.comLinksys sells [Network Address Translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) routers for around $60 USD. It's amazing how much computing and networking power they can shove in a cheap plastic box these days.Yeah or better still serverfault.comThanks for the reply! I have tried internet sharing using airport with one laptop connected to the internet via ethernet but another one seems to be not able to find IP address. I thought this might be because I only have one IP address assigned.I have one laptop connected to the internet via ethernet and does internet sharing via airport. However, another one cannot connect to the internet (In the network system preference, it warns that it cannot find IP address). It might be because I only have assigned one IP address?There is no reason for that option to ever be off - always show file extensions. I turn it on on every computer I use for more than 5 minutes.I'd say it has something to do with the $.99 Apple's income... :PI don't know a direct answer to your question, I'm pretty sure iPhoto can do it, but I'm not 100% sure.  That said, keep your RAWs.  If you ever need to make any adjustments (contrast, exposure, color balance etc) the result will be much better using RAW images.  You lose data when you convert to jpeg, the RAW has all of the data that the camera captured.Maybe someone had the Same Error before...anything that automates is worth (at least) looking at.+1 for mentioning the superb customer support!It does the same for files on my desktop.+1 for reading the question a different way than me and for a very valid point as a result.Thanks. I actually used Adobe Encore, but your method may work as well. I tried using HandBrake but it kept crashing.Even though I ended up purchasing from amazon, I gave you the credit as I would've purchased refurb if it was available...  wasn't aware of this option.Thanks, I thought the "Import From Sim" button was the very bottom of that page. Doh!Quite strange as I am now using it for quite a long time without a single crash. ymmv of course but don't hesitate to post crash logs to developers.Interesting.   It *might* then be permissions:  open a Terminal, type `ls -ld ~/.Trash`.  It should look something like `drwx------  46 allbery  staff  1564 Mar 30 23:50 .Trash/` (with your username instead of mine).This is an excellent App.@PhilipRegan - Was about to ay the same thing.So how would I fix permissions? With that command?Depends on what's broken, but simple permissions issues would be `sudo chown $USER ~/.Trash; sudo chmod 700 ~/.Trash`.Tried iStumbler. I see my network twice (once with 2,4Mhz and one with 5,5Mhz). First signal is 76% and second 58%. My MBP is 10cm from my capsule. I'm using channel 1 while all other networks in the vicinity are using channel 11. Noise is 13% (added the screenshot to my initial post). The advanced options in the Airport configuration are "Multicast Rate" which is on "Low" and "Use Wide channels" which is activated.Nope, still wants to trash things permanently.Make sure that you have rw access to your home folder. Select your home folder and choose RMB->`Get Info`.Chrome used to work, but now when I click a Mac App Store link it just forwards me to the page about the MAS on Apple's site.  I'm not sure why!There's plenty of reason for it to be off. File Extensions don't matter nearly as often as you think they do. It's funny that on Windows I always always ALWAYS enabled extensions (and I think that's more due to .scr/.pif/.exe/.com security than anything), but I love not having extensions in OSX. The icon, file type, and other details are descriptive enough to tell me what to expect when I open it.LudoMC: that is very normal.  Walk away from it slowly and see how rapidly the signal drops off.  I still think interference is the problem here - it may be sitting next to (or under, or on top-of) something emitting a strong signal.  Take particular note when you put a wall between yourself and the device, and see what the change is.  If one wall in particular affects your signal more than the others, perhaps there are cables or even a device in the wall having a detrimental effect.  (Yes, I've found devices in walls using this method.)The method in the link is the way to do it.Sorry, I was not clear. The link is about combining pdf files, and that is fine. What if I want to combine image files, and get a pdf as my result? Have I to convert them all into pdf files beforehand?Yes, this is what I tried too. Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but if I start with *image* files, I drop them one after another in the drawer, I select all and save as a pdf file, only one file ends up being saved in the pdf file I get. (Plus "what's so difficult in this method" is slightly patronising and not terribly helpful, if I may afford an opinion.)Yes, great! Thanks.I understand, as soon as the link is published on Vimeo ... I'll share it in the meantime: http://fischer.org.za/howto/MultipleImagestoPDF-iPhone.m4v@Gary Green This is a home computing question, not a serious server question for serverfault.This happens for all apps, not just a single one. And since I haven't written/submitted any apps, I doub't that is the issue.I upvoted earlier to thank you for pointing me out to iStumbler. Anyway, is there a way to improve the signal, from Airport tool or the way the capsule is placed? I keep thinking it's strange that at 10cm from the Mac the signal is only 78%. Could it be a faulty device as suggested by CajunLuke?This application was already recommended.... I see no point in providing the same answer...Thanks for the detailed response. I'll take a look at those. i-Pusher looks like what I'm after. Strangely it doesn't seem that popular yet. A bit pricey, they would do better at 1.99 or .99.I wonder though if i-Pusher is safe. Not to be biased, but it looks like its from Russia, and I identify Russian software with Hackers. It may not be based in reality, but its just how I feel.where on you machine? Screen top of lid, bottom, near keyboard?@LudoMC - actually this is normal.  I almost never see a noise reading that isn't 13%, and I've never seen a signal strength of 100% (or even 90%+) with an Airport.  I think because iStumbler represents the data in a way which we don't necessarily understand because we're not wireless engineers.Do you set Automatic Login on or off?great summary, I think covered it all. Didn't know about the Lion trick though. Is there a menu option for point and click? I guess this should be expected; one of the "tent poles" of Lion is native resume across the OS similar to iOS.(thanks for asking) Reinstallation worked. Looks like I did something wrong when I installed first. Able to see the stand menu.Updated my post.Super nice ! That's what I was looking for ! ThanksWhy Terminal when there is [iTerm2](https://sites.google.com/site/iterm2home/)?Here's the Vimeo link :) http://vimeo.com/21771864Off. If I recall cOrrectly.I had a dvd that i thought had os x on it. It seems to ignore it when I switch on my mac pro with it in the drive, so I was just checking to see if I could verify it was the disc not the mac pro at fault by booting it on a dell laptop someone has.Invaluable, and a complete game changer. Once you're testing you cannot beat the (still free) TestFlight service!this is what we did in the end.Perfect. Thanks so much!I am asking about tethering an iPad to an iPhone. I am not iterested in OSX or Windows.It is obviously flash ROM because it's cheaper to manufacture than RAM and would have no capability to write to it after it's been burned.@HandyRandy It's in the *Safari* (or application) menu, but shown only when you hold ?. It could still be changed though. Can you (or anyone else) try if windows still get restored after quitting?OK, reading the comment I may have misunderstood the question. Can you clarify what you want to do?If you _really_ want to "make the jump", I recommend a real Mac-centric editor, TextMate. It comes with a shell command that'll launch it, "mate", it's free, and it's significantly superior to gedit (and most other editors, IMHO.) You'll ease your transition into loving OSX if you accept doing things differently, starting with dumping your Gnome apps.Perfect, thanks a lot!Since when does Apple cover cosmetic damage?@nix Textmate is not free. It's like $40.@loic-wolff Oh, so it is. Well worth it!! I guess i bought it so long ago, i forgot, LOLBut I agree with @nix. Try to look for a native app. Fraiseapp (http://fraiseapp.com) is really nice and free. And if you really like it, Smultron which has the same core is on the App Store for only a few bucks.There is an app Air Video (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/air-video-watch-your-videos/id306550020?mt=8)Already answered [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2106/how-can-i-stream-files-to-my-ipad)fantastic app! +1That is really handy. Thanks so much.Sorry for not being clear - I was trying to run gedit form bash. Also, I'd be using TextMate if it were free. Once I get a few extra bucks, I'd like to pick it up... what are some advantages of TextMate over gedit?I see why - because 4 isn't needed and it's slower. But I have mine on 4 due to other reasons and, as long as you keep it clean, it's not that bad and not so much slower.What about FTP? But again you'll need third-party server/clientGenius thought on finding a readymade Windows USB installation, because that's going to save me a huge amount of headache.That's right, it's the RAM that's soldered.  Good thinking[Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)'s disc mode is a far better implementation than MacFusion. It has some [bugs](https://twitter.com/nuc/status/47945970817830912) though :(@global nomad: well this didn't work for me. I ran the uninstaller with sudo and mode all, rebooted and reinstalled xcode 3.2.3, but Software Update still doesn't recognize it.Ok I will try that thank you very muchWe need to see what file was modified, and it'd be great if we knew what "something" was that you installed. You can use [Secrets.prefpane](http://secrets.blacktree.com/) to show hidden files in Finder, then open up ~/.bash_profile, or .profile, or .bashrc, or what have you in your favorite text editor, then copy/paste into here.Clear I'm no network engineer...! Just sad the capsule doesn't perform better. Probably linked also to the inner antennas; design has a price. I accept your answer till I get the magic one which will put my capsule to 200% signal :)Check also this post: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6590/cleaning-white-macbookThis is finally what I did. 8 rubber feet for 2.99 at the local hardware store. They're clear... but meh, it works.My last MacBook Pro 17" was bought as a refurb from the Apple Store. I've been using it for four years developing commercial software.It would be better if you entered this answer as a comment in your own question though..It certainly seems as a hardware problem, so if its still under warranty, you should visit an apple store asap!This community appreciates a little extra bit of info or something like that to make answers more than just a link. Can you add some such tidbit here? Thanks!This works. The only problem is that the slowest it can go is 1/2 speed.Lovely. :) Didn't know how you could do this before, so I stuck with Chrome. :|Yeah, the ones I ended up using weren't the same color as the old Stealth Fighter PowerBook G3 either, but like you say... meh. They worked fine, and how often do you look at the bottom of your laptop anyways? Glad that worked out for you!thanks ripperdoc. I guess we're still missing a really good app for this. but thanks anyways!Hi. Yeah a folder called "Utilitarios" (Tools in English) was created (I didn't do it) and the icon is in there. Thanks. I didn't had any folder before (except games, automatically created by iOS) so it didn't occur to me. Thank you very much.I know that's a possibility, but iirc, there are some sites that detect you have Flash support installed, and use Flash instead of HTML5 for video for examples, so would like to avoid that..I think I tried that once before, but I'll give it another try to be sure when I get home againI don't have enough points on this site to vote you up. I usually hang around in webmasters.stackex...@Osvaldo Check the checkmark next to the answer to accept it. That's more important than voting it up, and you don't need to have any reputation to accept an answer to your question.@perfectlynormal I tried that way to install a newer version of Flash into Chrome and it did worked! Let me know of you have any issues..Please run the command `ls -leO@d ~ ~/.Trash` and post the results -- that might help show exactly what needs fixing.+1 for the Option/Alt trickNot really an answer to your question but maybe a workaround. You could use automator to add actions to the services menuAlt: no such button.Too bad I never use the desktop for anything but storage devices.`ls | say` to say a list of filesYES and NO are also possible instead of 1 and 0.Note that if you use it on a second display the colors may not be correct.I am actually typing this comment in a stuck window :pWait, Adobe actually **did** read the HIG?Most of those are not Mac OS X-specific.@Radek: There is also Cmd+H for your home directory.Were you (close to) out of space on the external drive?You mean hold the letters for a while?The signature likely changed with the new drive, but my experience is that it wouldn't back up rather than deleting them.

He's interested in other computers using his network.hm, then something like [Mocha](http://nakkaya.com/mocha.html) ?It reports this: `drwxr-xr-x+ 37 Moshe  staff  - 1258 Mar 27 13:26 /Users/Moshe

If you're actually interested in security, you set your router to block everything incoming except your VPN. Then using OpenVPN or Hamachi or whatever, you let yourself inside. Much simpler, and simpler is usually more secure.Oh, and I don't know how you expect to send a message back to the attacker. They just have some scripts running and aren't going to have their own ports open for you to connect back into.I've upgraded 3 Macs to Snow Leopard and none of them had that much space freed up. But even if my answer isn't helpful, the printer drivers account for much more than you credit.This worked! It found a bunch of permissions settings and fixed them.the official answer I got from Apple Store was it free up about 8GB...  so how much did you free up?If I recall correctly about 10GB each for the two Mac Pros and about 6GB from the MacBook Pro, but the MacBook Pro didn't have printer drivers installed on it.If you want to know the type of running applications, you can also use Activity Monitor, which can show the type of executable being run.wow, yours is a really expert answer.  does that mean the binary files that almost always "double the size" or even triple, if they include all PowerPC, Intel 32bit and 64bit versions?  For example, I downloaded Xcode, and it is 4GB... 4GB, no kidding, remember when we have hard disk that was merely 20MB.  So if out of those 4GB, 2.5 GB is binary, then if it includes all 3 versions, then only 800MB is really used by me?  Also, why doesn't the OS "trim" the other ones if it is Snow Leopard, knowing the other 32 bit and PowerPC ones won't be used?Nathan - 90GB left on the HD.Please tell us what exactly do you mean by "delay the audio"? (OS version would help too)+1 For the method to force an app to run in 32bit mode.This question should be closed *only* because it isn't properly wrote, the title is as vague as it can be and the content contains lots of unclear questions.@???? Most of a program's size is in its resources: pictures, strings, localization, nibs/xibs, etc. An OS X program can have a fat binary with any number of architectures: OS X looks for and uses 4 archs (x86, x84-64, PPC, PPC64). As for your size question (again), if you look at a cross-platfrom app (like Photoshop or Firefox), the OS X version with usually 3 (PPC, x86, x86-64) binaries won't be all that much bigger than the Windows version with one binary.@???? The OS doesn't trim the binaries to the local architecture so you can move them between systems with ease (so you don't have to re-download them). *You*, however, can remove the architectures you don't want with the `lipo` tool on the commandline.Really nice answer. +1 for giving two explanations.As far as I know, `sudo mv` does not allow launch services to track the location of the application. Use Finder to move the app by entering the password when asked for it, so Mac App Store can see that the app is still installed. Otherwise, it'll think it has magically moved.@Ivan: I wanted to do that, but Finder did not ask for a password - it just gave the notice and the move operation stopped. We'll see what happens, I can always `mv` it back if the Mac App Store wants it in the `/Applications/` directory.@???? @CajunLuke: don't get too enthusiastic with `lipo`.  While the OS can transparently run different programs in different modes, anything that runs as part of another program (e.g. browser plug-ins, as in @Rene Larsen's answer) has to run in the same mode as the main program.  This is the main reason for the "Open on 32-bit mode" option.  Also, since the kernel generally runs in 32-bit (for compatibility with older drivers), everything that loads into the kernel should have the 32-bit version left in.really... it was an Intel macbook to begin with, so all the PPC code was there for a mistake?I see... in Finder, click "Applications", and when see Firefox, CTRL-click to use "Get Info", and use "Open in 32 bit mode"...@emgee You can see I avoided using the word "security" as it's too broad of a subject. *And* I used the word "open" a lot - I know how to close everything but I'm looking for solutions to leave it open. Lastly, I gave an idea on how to "send a message back" by changing the welcome msg. That's just 1 idea, I bet there are other ways.Thanks for the suggestion! But not looking for the trivial way to do "security" here. ;)Tried to make the question more clear. Why does OS version matter?that's one reason why GPL isn't truly free, unlike MIT.No, not a mistake. Mac applications can bundle together multiple versions of executable for a variety of useful reasons. In Snow Leopard, Apple decided to cut out PPC code.I've done the same but my copied songs are not showing when i click on iPod icon in my iphone.can I try running everything in 32 bit or 64 bit mode?  For example, if I open up Terminal, and use `ls` or `man ls`, then can I try using them as 64 bit or 32 bit mode (and Python or Ruby as well)Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-othe/3047#3047@Josh K, You are so... off-topic. If this this not about osx, what is :D@Sorin: The question has been edited since that comment. (Sep 1 vs Oct 2).When your iPhone is attached, in iTunes click on the name of your iPhone in the left column. A series of tabs (sort of) will appear on the right, with with "Summary" tab selected by default. Click on the "Music" tab, check the "Sync Music" checkbox, and choose "Entire music library."

For a volume's icon it looks like the file is called .VolumeIcon.icn rather than Icon, but other than that it works exactly like you said.@???? yes, use `arch -i386` as a command prefix to force 32-bit (e.g. `arch -i386 ls`), and `arch -x86_64` to force 64-bit.  Note that this only controls this one execution (next time you use `ls`, it'll go back to normal), and won't include subprocesses (e.g. if you run a bash script with `arch -i386`, bash will run in 32-bit, but any other programs it starts will probably run in 64-bit mode).  I don't know of a way to run *everything* in 32-bit, but it might be possible by playing with the relevant kernel variables with `sysctl`.OS version matters because you'd be surprised at the number of questions that come from users using Windows and stuff like that.

Under Mobile Substrate Addons turn off any cydia apps you are running (careful not to turn off something you don't recognize, they may actually brick your phone if turned off.).  Then Respring.

The warning seems to appear way too much thus giving false positives. But I'm still studying it as I may just be using it wrong or have to customize it more.Even if it does everything it says, I will still be missing a way to automatically counter attack (such as simply being able to run a script given a specific pattern is found).

Glad it was still useful. :-)Won't the graph be a little spaghetti-like? What format is the data currently in? (Doesn't make a huge difference, but it would help to know.) I use R a lot and I think it could definitely handle the graph you're talking about. I just tried generating a 40 column by 5000 row matrix and plotting it using matplot and it took 23 seconds on my Mac on battery power.Numbers spins indefinitely trying to draw the plot after I select the 480th row. Excel: the 1000th row. I'm using the latest Numbers but my MS Office is several years old. Both display the data in tables just fine, they only fall apart when plotting it.That first R tutorial link looks really promising.@Wayne: the look is okay for my purposes. The data is a lot of zeros in the series with periods of non-zero values that don't really overlap from series to series. It's in CSV with each series a column and the first column is the timestamp for the sample interval.Microsoft Excel for Mac is notoriously unreliable, even more than the PC version. I also faced crashes in the rare cases where I used it for more than data cleaning.There are three different graphics packages in R, and each probably has several ways of doing what you want. In the base graphics package, I think matplot would do what you want, and read.csv can read in your data.Thanks for the info. Unfortunately, modifying that file didn't help. However, I found if I create an alias to the shortcut, then use the alias, the Places name would be that of the alias.Isopropyl is great because it evaporates quick and doesn't corrode metal.

Then maybe those, I cannot run as 32-bit?@???? yes, you can do this for any program, but if you tell it to use an architecture the program doesn't include, you'll get a "Bad CPU type in executable" error.  BTW, if you want to know exactly what architectures a given program has, use the `file` command on it.  Note that you must tell file exactly where the executable program is (e.g. `file /bin/ls` not just `file ls`; similarly, `file /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin`).thanks, when you ask "Final question, why do you want your application listed under your user Applications folder?", I wanted them there because, once upon a time, there were applications of some sort listed there.

Whatever aspect ratio you want, just set the resolution to match.  It's simple math.This is assuming that I have access to the internet 24/7. What if I dont? I just want to drag and drop files to the device.I know how open works and I am ready to bet that this will not solve the problem of calling the exe from the shell, abd this was my intend.@CajunLake: I have corrected my question. Its the hardware.Dude, you need an award for your patience.That's what I use. Sad it doesn't go for multi-window apps (like browsers or document apps).Ok then.  Set them to "open with" your own bash shell.  Your own bash shell looks something like...

#!/bin/bash

path_to_wine=/some/path/here
./path_to_wine $1
exit 0

Make sure to chmod +x your shell script.Stream pictures? That was so not helpful.Not an ideal solution - there are some e-mails that I really shouldn't see, as they aren't technically mine - but my relatives (it's a legacy of the way our ISP handed out email accounts). And my PC experience, it wasn't OUtlook + Exchange. It was Windows Mail and my ISP's POP server. From what I can tell, it downloaded the headers, then applied the rules, and only requested the full content of the e-mails that didn't match my 'do not download rule'.what happens if you stream from like Spotify? Does it disconnect in the same manner? I think the problem is in the windows things.@Chris_O - Good luck with yours! It is a nice device when it works. But I agree, the people at the Apple store have too much attitude and it makes me sad that I am buying Apple products because I don't like to use my money to reward that behavior.You need an internet connection to use the unbundled iWork apps?To download them, yes. I've (hopefully) clarified my post.Interesting.  I don't think Mail.app can do headers-only, unless it's buried in a plist or config file somewhere.In OS X Lion, there will be "File Sharing for iPad" http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/Apple currently does not have a "you can download it again for free feature." It is your responsibility to backup your media. iTunes for Windows will even alert you, "Do you want to back up your music?"Maybe this functionality could be added to the app/software you will use for recording. So, in which application you'll use it?There might be some CLI app to inspect the key state of caps lock, so checkModifierKeys could very well be replaced to make the script act on caps lock.And for this question the mute status is the opposite as needed, so invert the volumes to get the right functionality.You're not likely going to find one, at least not without doing damage. There's a reason iFixit (and others) have produced custom tools for this.I love my data. Knowing it's safe is worth waiting for. In the long view two weeks isn't much time at all. And it was 1/2 a terabyte.@Marque Yes, I know. The point is that I want the aspect ratio to be different
 than the rest of the project. So, setting a global ratio when I export won't help.@nuc Basically I want it to use it when I'm talking on Skype.. I want to use it as a walkie-talkie.. in order to talk you should press a button..! :)You might try to reset the cable modem (by unplugging the power). If it is only willing to provide DHCP for a single host, it may not give an address to the Airport while still remembering your laptop.Thanks for that.. I don't have time now to test all these things.. but basically what I want is to use Skype as a Walkie-talkie... hold a key to talk..! So I would prefer one key like F5 or something if the CapsLock is out of the question :)For utpo 5 computers activation the offer it for 99$. If I buy via the app store, do I have to pay for each computer separately?I was thinking about this, but doesn't iTunes complain about the link when the HD is off or not connected?Look in the App Store Help menu, under Purchase applications > Use applications on multiple Macs: "After you purchase an application, you can install it free of charge on every Mac you use."Aaah... you didn't say only a PART of the video.  In that case, you have to create the part that you want as a different aspect ratio as a second project, then export it as its own video... then import that as a section of your current video.  Since it will have a different aspect ratio than your current video, you can play with the cropping features there.  That's just playing with the cropping of that particular section and you can/will get the black bars that you want.Good question.  I use the setup I was describing with an iMac that has long run out of sufficient space - so I don't disconnect that drive very often.  My guess would be that you would just have dead links in iTunes for your movies.  Either way, I think it's worth a test.@Patrick: Only if you try to open a movie from the HD, then it can find the path.@Harald: I'm almost embarrassed to admit I didn't try this and this actually solved things. Thanks for reminding me about something simple! :) If you make it an answer I'll accept it for you.Thanks as well.  I'm waiting on a NAS to be shipped, but once it is I'll give this a try with my movies.I second this feature requestThanks a lot! :)Thanks. F9 does indeed show all windows. I'll have to train myself to use Expose instead of command-tab (I'm coming to Mac from Linux.)I'd like to create one...@Marque Haha, good point. Updated. My bad for not being clear.yeah as I said, there might not be a computer around, and iPad should not depend on having another computer to "make it work"Hi, thanks for the apple link, I'll read into that.

Although the question is about the cpu hogging that the process does.Command tab has its purposes too... Don't not-use it.Thanks for the suggestion.  I had to turn off the "Change picture" option in the Desktop and Screen Saver prefpane, but it works like a charm!Thank you so much!That's a good one too! Probably easier for my trained fingers to remember than F9.I am interested in why you can't use the wireless, since you mentioned it... Actually, the reason might be instructive if we can't otherwise solve your problem.what if you cant connect the me.com thing cuz i didnt install it before i lost it?Hi, thanks for answering. I am concerned that when an app such as safari freezes, does it lose any dynamic content.. like half written emails, blog posts, stackexchange answers? This question because I suspect that freezing means it would reload the webpage when I switch apps and return to the browser.When it is frozen, the app will store its current state, meaning it should be the same when you come back. However, Safari will reload the page if you are gone for more than a few minutes. This is because Apple designed it that way, and not because of the freezing.... and it came back with the same issue. Dammit.Not necessarily -- Safari will keep a webpage in memory until that memory is needed by another app. Only *then* will it reload the page when you come back to it. I've left webpages open on Safari only to come back to them the next day; they were still in memory so it just displayed them as they were when I last had Safari open.I replaced the glass on my 3GS with a kit from them and there were two big problems. First, it was actually quite difficult to do; if you don't have a lot of electronics experience and, especially, are used to doing things like using a heat gun to release glue, etc., I don't recommend doing it yourself. Second, the oleophobic coating of the original Apple part is way, **way** nicer: my screen gets gross very quickly and requires near-constant cleaning, and it doesn't clean well without a ton of rubbing. Wish I'd taken it to Apple, even with the significantly greater price.@Brant I guess that's your experience. In mine, it reloads the page if I haven't looked at it in the past few minutes, even if I was still in Safari but looking at a different page. Sometimes it reloads from cache instead of actually reloading, but it still causes it to get rid of form content.I'll award the bounty to this one, assuming no one posts last minute with a magic solution.Superb! worked a treat for me, thank yousee also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1054/keyboard-shortcut-for-accessing-address-bar-in-firefoxSee also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11573/chrome-keyboard-shortcut-to-go-to-address-barIf you have a Track pad, you can also enable the Four Finger swipe to open Expose. It takes a while to get use to, but it's another option depending where your hands are. Coming from a background similar to yours, I haven't *quite* figured out a way to stay completely away from the mouse.Where 'your own bash shell' = 'your own bash script'.I can't say enough how great this app is. Totally chained how I listen to podcasts.Mine is also `Version 5.0.3 (745)`. How can I reinstall iChat? Should I reinstall whole OS again?I have heard that the TC has a real bad failure rate after it runs for a year... right on time when the warranty expires. I wonder if Apple programs it to self destruct.I notice a Tracking Speed slowdown (by half perhaps), but otherwise I can continue to move it during, immediately after a click, whenever.This sort-of worked. I am able to boot off the Win7 DVD; however, my Win7 install is not showing up in the list of repairable OS's on the box. Any idea what driver[s] I might need on a 2009 MacBook (white plastic) to get this working?You should open that comment as a new question, Mandy.If you do need drivers (I don't think you should...) they would be on the OS X install disk, with the Bootcamp drivers.  I *think* Win7 allows you to insert the disk and it searches the disk for the correct drivers?  Try that.  But, I suspect, there is just some level of corruption here and not everything that needs to be in place is in place.  Meaning... back up your data, re-install Win7 on a fresh partition, and start from scratch.  Then restore your data.Also - I know that's not what you wanted to do, but I think you might be out of options.  You are allowed to obtain Windows 7 however you please, if you own a license to it.  I would just download it and use your own, legally purchased key.  I wouldn't be surprised if you could actually download it direct from Microsoft, come to think of it...you can download wireshark for mac os xYes, I meant +, and not -and it's not `chown` (changing the owner), it's `chmod`.Thanks for the wake-up call, I'm also fairly new to this, coming from a 18 year Windows background, trying to see the world beyond.I have this app for my iPhone. Didnt think of it when it came to the iPad. Thanks.is there any way to set the index, either on the Mac, or on the router so it works?But then my internet speed half as fast :/+1 Avoiding shady software is good tip for any OS. It also cuts down a fair share of the real need for an antivirus software on Windows.Are there (before reconnecting) mono and stereo options available under the BH-905 item in the MacBook's Bluetooth menulet? Or does it show only mono?The menulet always includes both options. It's just that if I accidentally choose "mono" just once this becomes the default option the OS automatically chooses when it auto-associates. However, I've repaved my machine since I first asked this question. I've been extremely careful not to choose mono and have been fine since. As long as I never get my mouse clicks wrong it'll continue to work OK ...I disagree. The website you link to doesn't show the Cmd-LeftArrow combination and yet it works.No, it doesn't answer half of the question.  Sometimes the headphones don't automatically associate; I'd say about 25% of the time I have to manually tell OS X to connect to the headphones. At this point I mouse to the menulet, hover "Nokia BH-905 >", and two menu choices appear "Use As Audio Device (Mono)" and "Use as Audio Device (Stereo)". If I *ever* accidentally choose mono then I'm screwed forever - next time it autoconnects I get the problem as described above. And at which point I can never put it back to defaulting to stereo ... and I don't consider repaving a solution. :P@AlexW, care to share which company you picked and your opinion?I see. What does the BH-905 show after you've chosen mono/stereo? (I have a pair of BH-501's which show "Don't use as Audio Device" If I select it, the menu reverts back the "Use as Audio Device (Mono)" and "Use as Audio Device (Stereo)" options, without losing the bluetooth connection.)It behaves the same way for me.  The difference is next time it *autoconnects* (and I have previously, accidentally chosen mono) it'll automatically choose the mono profile. Once it gets into this state it is never to be undone again.You will have to find the option in the router settings.  Once you do find it, change it to 0 or 1, whichever is lowest, and try again.@Michael There is no way to straight-up mirror the display from anything but an iPad 2.Only if both computers are constantly trying to use the Airport's whole bandwidth. And if that is a problem, follow the instructions in that link to set up the static route instead.I have absolutely no idea what I should tag this, so if anybody has a better suggestion, feel free to change it.Surprised this one got the bounty considering saying iMovie not supporting custom aspect ratios isn't actually true as I outlined how to do it below, nor do you need the extra software since you can set that when exporting via the advanced settings, again as I outlined below.  I also explained how to do exactly what you want--having only part of the video with a custom aspect ratio.  Again, scratching my head here that this was the one you awarded, even after my replies.@Marque This still doesn't do what I want. It will just squish or letterbox, not *crop*.@Marque Your method doesn't do what I need. See my comment.I kinda think this should be a comment since it doesn't give a functioning answer. It is good info, just not a full answer IMO.Those are indeed Emacs bindings; bash uses libreadline, which defaults to Emacs style. There are plenty of other bindings: CTRL+f / CTRL+b to move back and forward by character, and OPT+f / OPT+b to move by word (super useful!). Similarly, CTRL+d deletes the character to the right, and OPT+Delete deletes the word to the left.Legacy feature from NeXTStep. Thank you Apple.awesome stuff, good example, gotta love to pipe!FYI CarbonCopyCloner is only for HFS+. No go for exFAT volume that can be accessed through Windows 7 (BOOTCAMP) and OS X.Oh well. I wish I had known this before spending so much time trying to do this. I will leave the question open for a while, in case there's people out there that do know of a way. If there isn't any solution then I guess @ghoppe is right and I will select this as the corrent answer. *hope*Brilliant! a bit tricky at first, but I'll get use to it, this should save me lots of time, cheers! :)I used a company called Protect Your Bubble http://www.protectyourbubble.com/This hides the dock icon but also hides the app's menu bar which makes some features unusable (such as creating a new Guide line).Are you ok calling a script in Automator (or just doing this through a script)?What doesn't my answerdo?  I thought you said you wanted part of your video to have a different aspect ratio than the rest, and for that part to have black bars to compensate for the difference.  That's exactly what I told you how to achieve.  Granted, it's not elegant as it requires multiple steps, but that's the limitation of the tool.Again, to be clear... you take the video that you want to have with a unique aspect ratio and load that *part* into iMovie.  You then export the video in the aspect ratio you need.  You'll now have a video with aa custom aspect ratio.  You now import THAT video into the MAIN project in iMovie, and in there, you specify the cropping for that specific section and iMovie will add the black bars as needed to match the rest of the main video (and whatever resolution/aspect you choose when exporting it.)Hmmm the System Preferences need to have a option to choose vim bindings.I think I can remember the shortcut, then I just open Grab: CMD+SPACE, then type 'grab' and hit enter.I have to say, I turned off the genie effect almost immediately.I once read 'Option-click everything'I used Docker to get the little triangles back. I'm not a fan of the glowing orb.Gigabit Ethernet is great in not needing crossover cables for direct connections.I use it occasionally. I wished it was possible to disable antialiasing... To count pixels ;)Hmmm could it be possible that works only because first button is focused which is not the default OSX option?@titanium There's no way to hide the dock icon without hiding the menu bar. This has been asked before on other sites, and no one's ever gotten past the menu bar problem.You can execute shell scripts or AppleScripts from Automator. So, don't abandon Automator altogether. You'll need to supplement the drag-and-drop stuff, but you can do it all from an Automator workflow.OK. Thanks for the info. Data plans are costly so I will keep my old Nokia phone with me if iPhone doesn't have this facility.Best way might be to glue a cheap FM pocket radio to the back of your iPhone's case, as the iPhone 4 does not have broadcast FM receiver circuitry built-in.@Will Hardy `set -o vi`I like JustLooking (http://chipmunkninja.com/JustLooking).  Navigates more easily through a directory of files, and actually shows animations!Quicksilver has some scripts built into it--it's more than just a Search tool, from what I recall.  I think there were some iTunes plugins, and other application extensions.  Where Spotlight is great for searching and launching files/applications (what I use it for), Quicksilver can do more automations I believe.Can't handle everything I've thrown at it (sometimes chokes on password protected zips/rars, or split rars that may have been created on Windows(?), but I have a few backups in case.  This is my default archive extract utility.If Phoneview is a solution, I recommend [iPhone Explorer](http://www.macroplant.com/iphoneexplorer/).If you jailbreak it, you can run `vim` or `emacs` locally, and run `python` locally too.BBEdit is great for web development, but not so great for development in non-web languages.  (Case in point: syntax highlighting.)KeepassX is an ugly non-native app.  Its only redeeming quality is that it is cross-platform.I think I love you.Doesn't work in FF4 ;)Is there alternative apps that can doesn't have restrictions?Funnily enough, if I translate the text used by that option in the Finnish OS X to English, it's roughly "Work template". I think even just "template" would describe the option better than "stationery pad"Thanks, but I don't want all videos to be deleted - just enough to free up some space.Any way to use it with Unicode characters?@Jitendra no iPhone ever had AM/FM radio, and I would bet at least 10 to 1 that no iPhone ever will. It requires a transmitter, space and mostly a bad looking antena to enable good signal. Maybe someday they decide to make one into an iPad though which is big enough to have a radio with a built in hidden antena.yep, MacFusion is must have.I use FZ too and I like it. I have experienced that Cyberduck and Transmit is having difficulties uploading lots of files via FTP. Then I found Filezilla which has uploaded everything I have thrown at it.Thunderbird works great with imap to my gmail account. Microsoft Entourage is somewhat buggy with imap and crashes all the time. Apple Mail is incredibly slow with imap. Thankfully there is Thunderbird. Besides Thunderbird has plugins similar to Firefox.@Cawas: latest ipod nano has radio receiver, with headphones used as antenna, so why would it not be possible to do in iphone?I used aliases and symlinks (ln -s in the Terminal) now and get problems when I try to add stuff to my library. For example, if I add an m4v, I get the message: "Attempting to copy to the disk "Mac HD" failed. The required folder cannot be found.". Any ideas?Just remember to tell Gmail what to do in "When messages are accessed with POP" - e.g. choose "keep copy in the Inbox"@titaniumdecoy say what? it has built-in syntax highlighting for *dozens* of languages. Down in the bottom left of every window, there's a thing that says "(none)". click that to show a popup menu of all the built-in languages. you can add even more via plugins. i've been using it for bash and ruby scripting all week, and the syntax highlighting has been just fine.Yep, Nathan's right. If you're using Automator for your workflow, you can still use it to run another script to do what you want. When I said it won't be "enough" I didn't mean you'd have to abandon it.Transmit wins by a long shot regarding UI, but Filezilla works every time :)@Peter that's big news to me! :o I never said it was impossible. I meant that since it was never done in any apple devices (as far as I knew) it was probably due to quality restrictions. There are many small radio devices, but the ones without a good antena will behave poorly. I still maintain my feeling about iPhone FM radio, but I'll have to find a better reason now. Looks like I was proven wrong deadly fast this time! :)If you want the tiniest little bit of sound, you can turn the sound all the way down with "Volume Down" and then hit the "Mute" key to turn it up just a little bit.I don't have a copy of xScope so I'm not aware of all the side effects of not accessing the menu, my solution has all the same effects of the Dock Dodger or Dockless solutions, because I believe they are more or less GUI's for the edits shown in this answer.I'm marking your answer as accepted since I don't think there is a good solution to my question.Also a dup of http://superuser.com/questions/35334/how-do-i-change-the-default-screenshot-location-on-mac-os-xPossible duplicate http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8006/what-is-the-ipads-screen-refresh-rateI know all that. Push notifications *requires* a constant connection to Apple's servers. On devices with cellular data, it's easy since cellular are always on. However, on you don't want to have the WiFi antennas always on for battery live. The problem here is that FaceTime requires things to be fast, preferably instantaneous, so the devices cannot look at regular intervals on the server like the used to (in iOS 3.0).Yes. They are not always 'on' like receiving data. It checks every 15 minutes when on wifi http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3576Then, how can FaceTime works? You cannot wait 15 min. before somebody respond to your FaceTime call...Thanks, that answer my question.Awesome, so since you've posted this I've jailbroken and installed a couple cool Cydia apps. Any idea on how to get a terminal/bash shell in the iPad itself? I've got SSH but I would love a 'terminal' app. ThanksTherefore, you can't receive a FaceTime call with the screen off?Hm?  You should get a push notification; the screen will turn on, an alert will play, and a dialog will pop up.  Admittedly, noticing it is sometimes a problem if it's in your pocket and you aren't wearing headphones/earbuds.I should also recommend zsh instead of bash as your default terminal shell, you get M-x style commanding in zsh (and a lot of other nice usability features) - especially when you use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (consider it a starter kit for zsh)Losing customers is no problem when you have no new products to ship, all updates are free.You understand the question correctly. I'm going to check out Phone Explorer, thanks. But also check out the solution I found buried in camera.app.mobile terminal, but I think it might be buggy, in which case just ssh to 127.0.0.1 or localhost.Please do not use WEP. Please! Do! Not! Use! WEP!As much as we like to think the Geniuses are really geniuses, they've done some pretty spotty jobs putting my Mac back together. I'd go in and say "Hey, this stopped working last time I came in here."@wjlafrance the only alternative is to use no encryption at allThis is such an integrated part of my daily workflow. The previews are just eye candy. The shortcuts on dock items, and the resizing of windows are slick and extremely efficient.Kod is more powerful, just not enough add-on's / plugins. More importantly it's too buggy at the time (v0.0.3). That with the huge development slow-down , it isn't looking good. A lot like TM2 :0Sorry, I could have sworn WPA was in that list. Looks like I've got a bug report to file. Thanks for the correction. :)Seriously, this is the first app I install on any fresh system, it's that useful. A 'must have' app.Yep, this is an app of the highest quality. Another 'must have'.Awesome lil' app.Hm. Many external HDDs (w/o PSU) use an USB cable that has 1 male for the device and 2 males for the computer. Usually plugging just one into the computer is enough, but if one port doesn't provide enough power, the second plug will boost the connection with power from another USB port. I wonder: could a similar cable be used in the same fashion with an iPad & PC?Thanks. Indeed I've just noticed this! Is there anything more that can be done to improve the speed of charging? Some places say to have the computer in hibernate, or sleep, or something else again. But they are unclear about which method helps, and some even unclear about if you should put the iPad to sleep / turn it off, or the computer.Is it actually freezing, or waiting for the default 600-second timeout? Have you ever waited that long to find out?@Lode I don't think any change to the *laptop* will affect things at all, as it's likely that the power coming out of the USB port likely runs at a steady maximum regardless of its state. Shutting the iPad off, however, will undoubtedly help it charge more quickly: press and hold the power button (top of the iPad) until the red "Slide to power off" screen appears and then slide it. It should be using virtually no power at that point, so won't be working against the total charge.Yeh it is actually freezing. I've waited longer than that period. I could put up some logs but I'm unsure where to look.Thanks. Just wanted to make sure!No can do; I need ssh access to the machine, just not so much from outside.Odds are the OP wants that sync with US power in order to videotape them without having scan lines show. Since these aren't CRTs, though, it shouldn't be a problem. I know that I've videorecorded iPhone and iPad screens with no problems whatsoever.makes sense, then I'll wait some time and probably go for it. thanks ;)Nope and that is an extremely bad idea IMOThe last version I used was BBEdit 8.5 (maybe it's changed in version 9) but in my experience there are only 3 syntax highlights for non-HTML languages: keywords, text, and numbers.Why is it a bad idea to use the TRIM function ??Yes certainly have, and Finder sees all that spaceBecause it's not officially supported by the OS and could easily ruin your SSD or decrease performance significantly@Marque this doesn't work. Any new project in iMovie has to be either 4:3, 2:3, or 16:9. So, even if I export something at a custom aspect ratio, I can't import it at that ratio. Try it yourself.How do I get a new restriction password it keeps blocking me an hour at a time?
How do I restore factory settings it won't let me cox I don't know the pass word@MeEt - Ask that as a new question.It is officially supported by the OS on the new Macbook Pro's starting with OS X 10.6.6 - and it is this TRIM support you enable with the tool. The performance and empty space re-allocation can only be better when using TRIM - but it of course up to you what you want.This was good to see what was going on:
Start the computer in Verbose Mode (Cmd + v) and see if you can see a specific error message.I had a lot of errors from the airport card, but didn't bottom the problem out tbh. I just ran Disk Doctor in the end and that sorted it out.Looks like exactly what I needed..! Thank you!Well, I've already wrecked three hard drives in a Unibody Macbook Pro. The drive seems to spin down after 5-10 seconds. On the other hand, I never had troubles with a black Macbook.I might be able to roll one for you. ;)Thank you! I wasn't sure since I've seen some models with concealed sensors.The second screen shot is a detail of the first; it's the view of the disabled SSH setting in that dialog.I did a check of the FS and there are no issues, I've had similar things happen in the past.  I got disk util to see 14GB free now but Boot Camp Assistant still doesn't have 10GB available.  It's issues with how partitioning seems to work in OSX  I guess where you need contiguous free space at the end of a diskYou may be able to set up password on your AirPort Extreme router, I know that many programs written for wireless connection require set passwords in order to attempt the connection you might be able to do the same.That's correct, however if it is 5,1, a firmware update may be needed: http://www.9to5mac.com/54663/did-apple-release-a-secret-macbookpro-firmware-update-that-enables-8gb-ram-config/A PC will only put out 500ma of power regardless of configuration, operating system, etc.Awesome. I didn't know that was possible.I haven't seen this occur with recent versions of Mac OS X 10.6.x (Snow Leopard).  What version are you using?@GaryW.Longsine I'm on a MacBook, running Snow Leopard 10.6.6How about using Google Docs?How is QuickLook less convenient? You don't have to open another application. And TextEdit will open .doc files, but won't be able to show some features.Yes we know that this feature exists but the problem is that Apple does not provide an easy way to remove the duplicates. If you sort them by name you with have to command-click each second one in order to remove them. Imagine how it is if you have 2000 duplicates.I don't think you can assume there are no problems with your data, Finder and Disk Utility should report the same freespace, The fact they are not indicates to me there are files that you have deleted but are still showing up somehow. I think you need to backup, reformat and reinstall. That should solve your problem.Thanks! I am assuming that I can since my system shows up as MacBook7,1. I'm not in a rush, I just wanted to make sure I plan my upgrade path as proper as possible.Unfortunately restarting the phone won't solve the problem: any iOS 4+ app that had a background process running at restart -- a local notification timer, GPS region tracking, etc. -- will have its process started back up again automatically. Annoying, but true. Manually force-quitting is the only sure way to stop them.Thanks Gary. I'm running 10.6.7. I'll try (1) the next time this happens. Re: (2) - this pretty well describes what's happening here. If I do this I get a graphical error message '-10810' instead of this appearing in the Terminal. Either way Finder doesn't relaunch. Re: (3) - I've already repaired permissions but this hasn't helped the problem. None of those logs seems to show anything of note around the time the last freeze occurred. I'll take a look at the server logs now.QuickLook often messes up a lot of the contents of .doc files. It's not rare to see missing objects and/or misplaced elements. For simple .docs it's ok, but that's as far as it goes.

Didn't understand the question :)I can have git create it's .git control structure in a directory outside of my working directory. Regardless the comparison if it can't be done I'll ask for alternatives to Finder.Thanks a million man - everything so far has been insanely confusing - your advice is incredibly straightforward and easy to followRats, I should have chosen a less flexible example.  You're right about git, and that brings to mind that you could always choose to file an issue with Apple so that perhaps a future version of the Finder could be as flexible.Somehow I doubt that will carry much weight. Thanks for your answer thoughYou're welcome.  They probably prioritize features based on the frequency of complaint, so you may want to reconsider.  The [Wikipedia entry for DS_store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS_Store) suggests that the way the metadata is stored changed at least once in the lifetime of the Finder, based upon user complaint.  (It used to store it at the root of the relevant filesystem.)How does that relate to the Apple Support Document posted in my answer? I know my iPad's Wifi stays on too. So maybe its not correct in the Support Document even though recently updated (at least since an iPad has been out, as well as the most recent Touch I think.I do not own a wifi-only device that can make FaceTime calls.

I'm using OSX 10.6, standard `/bin/ps` doesn't have that option.@jmlumpkin: To be honest, I have no idea whether FaceTime is usable on an iPod Touch; as I said, that's up to Apple whether they switch to "pull" notifications when the screen is off or if that breaks it. In any case, what I said isn't incompatible with what you said or the tech note:  they work, but there's no promise of instant response. If I were an Apple engineer I'd either say "not fully compatible with iPod Touch" or switch to "pull" mode when the screen is off and FaceTime is active, but they might simply assume that if you turned it off you're not in a hurry and can wait 15 minutes.Very important point, thanks!

I suspected it was a recent problem as I hadn't noticed so many network issues a few months ago, but I also changed computers so I wasn't sure.  I guess until Apple fixes it, I'm stuck choosing between my computer freezing up when changing between GPUs on 10.6.6 or losing connection in games because of latency spikes in 10.6.7.In case you are referring to my answer, note that I did not say that it could not be done.

http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/asepsisThat is the theory.  I would like to see if there's any difference because of faster machine.  It could be related to timeout settings in the script.I'm not sure why this was voted down; TotalFinder is a Finder plugin and so arguably is a direct solution to the question.Ah, interesting.

Secondly, if you want this question to stay open, you should **accentuate the Mac-side of it** (and maybe add some one use per answer rule -like on the other CW questions-).

I've already flagged it and asked to made it a wiki (this is the way it goes, isn't it?)I agree, and that's the way to do it. But it's not Mac-specific enough. It could be ask *as is* on SuperUser, hence no value asking it here. But if you specify **Mac-only uses**, then it might have a chance here. And while you're adding the Apple-solution only rule, add some rules about 1 solution per answer and to look for already added answers (use the other community wiki question for inspiration).Done.

I would try importing all of the songs you have into the new library (wherever you want it to last) and see if you can import your old library file to recover some of the playlists and meta-data. This is the sort of thing where calling AppleCare really shines if you've paid for that support. The other angle is to use the option launch trick to point iTunes at whatever old iTunes library file you have. Don't actually play any music - just export the library to an xml file on the desktop. That imports better than adding a library file in my experience.@Nas I should have said the name before, but I don't think it really matters.

Typically, if the application has windows open and visible, it will simply switch to that application; if it only has minimized windows open, it will raise the most recently accessed window; if no window is open, it will open either a new document or the application's default window.Please tone down the Apple bashing.

Can't even add the items to the folder first and then to the library.@Lri All posts in this tread are community wikis. That means that anyone can edit them to improve them. Why don't you make an edit with the correction?If you know someone with a MakerBot 3D printer, you could use a victrola horn. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6957.DS_store files are not a problem. They are system files that are there and are hided by default for a reason!Best of luck recovering/rebuilding thing. For the future - just be sure to export your whole library as an xml - from there you can recover much easier if you ever have data loss or corruption. Thanks for the kind words.Jeff - what version of Mac OS and adobe reader are you running?thanks for the correction @eyelidlessness - it's actually not tilde, as that is only activated with shift.  updated the answer.I'll second @Mark 's suggestion to evaluate [Pathfinder](http://www.cocoatech.com/faqs) to mostly replace Finder in this situation.@bmike: The latest of both.  OS X 10.6.7 and Reader 10.0.1.Can you do anything with the PDF button in adobe reader? Sometimes you could mail it or do one of the other options and extract it there.Thanks for the suggestion, but that won't work.  Adobe highlights the form fields in red so it will look different.  Also, I think the resolution would be too low.Can you save it into any other intermediary format?Mac OS X uses SACKs, and I don't imagine you can change that. [SU thread](http://superuser.com/questions/65407/tcp-implementation-on-mac-os-x).Have you done a hardware test? Sounds to me like a logic board went bye-bye, but I'm no expert.I have the option to save as PDF (editable) and txt.Nope. That's next on the agenda.I so wish this feature existed in the Finder itself, and not just the Open/Save dialog. I would LOVE to be able to enable hidden files temporarily, on-the-fly, as it were.Fans are at maximum making that "there's an Xserve announcing it's presence" sound. PMU reset also on the to-do list Monday. Thanks. :)It would be nice to clarify the question a bit since most people don't have any problems with signatures and gmail. Specifically - what font and size are mail set to, same for the signature as well as let us know if you have selected to make the signature match the default message font and size.This question can't be answered decisively since so much depends on the actual situation on the mac providing the data. FW800 is generally slightly faster than Gigabit ethernet for sustained data transfers due to the lower overhead and latency. Connecting the two macs with a single cable will reduce network effects, but the major factor in running migration assistant is how fragmented the directory catalog is and not whether FW800 or GBE is used for connection. 100 ethernet is the slowest followed closely by FW400.Is there any way I would be deleting something that os x needs to run?Poosible, but doubtful considering that you're clicking through the errors and they're not loading anyway.  If you want to be ultra-safe, move the folders to your desktop temporarily and then reboot.  If there's a problem, boot into single user or safe mode and copy them back.  Whenever I've had drivers/kexts that don't load I just blow them away.  The system itself is never affected.Thanks a bunch RobZolkos!It exists in the Finder plugin [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/). Maybe there are other plugins which do nothing else but add that feature.The problem you are having does not appear to involve any Apple hardware, so it's a bit outside the realm of expertise of this community. My suggestion is to ask your question on http://superuser.com/ - that is the correct place for a question like this.Thanks Kyle. Will do.The problem isn't .ds_store files, it's that apparently the best way apple could think of managing folder settings is to have finder automatically create a hidden file in ***every*** directory it is ***ever*** used to view.The system should not be spawning files in any directory other than system directories, **of any type**, ***ever***, unless I **explicitly** tell it to.It did occur to me to disable the process altogether, but having spoken with the team they would find the disabling of thumbnails system-wide unacceptable. Hence looking for a network share / directory-only solution.Are you able/willing to divulge a link so we can inspect the content and it's encoding formats?`or is there`...? Seems your sentence is not finished!to me that's a "lol" app!Strongly agree with you, cooling is another issue I've been thinking about while searching info about BookArc. Thanks for your answer!Yes, obviously I've tried GUID option before postingThanks, it worked!@NR4TR did you find any reports of excessive heating?This ought to have been fixed by now, you'd think...OK - I downloaded Reader 10.0.1 and it self updated before I could stop it to 10.0.2 and crashed a few times. Answer might be possible - checking one thing...I see... trying now... although, would like to also be able to download the ones on web... say, if the one on web has a higher resolution or if it is on web but not on else where...But thats not how it works. Sorry. Not on macs, nor on PC's, and until tech companies change that, the best solution is to hide the files as they are by default, or just live in peace with the bunch of hidden folders all over the place.Indeed, I updated Aperture and it works but I don't know if this solved the problem or the other answer (I did both...). But thanks !OK, it seems to work !Yeah, it's almost as if the most common syntaxes were invented by Americans. ;-)Yes, it was three fingers up and down. Thanks!Recommendation for MacPorts seconded.  It will fill in all of the utilities you are used to having in Linux but don't come with OS X.This is a question about prerelease software, which changes quickly and often. Any problem and answers will probably vanish or change by the release.This belongs as an answer in the [Mac OS X hidden features and nice tips and tricks](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks) thread. Please post it there. Thanks.New to this, thanks for the help, just posted it there.Better use `diskutil mount [name]` and `diskutil umount [name]`.Is this Mac currently connected to any Windows workgroup? If so, is it connected to the workgroup the printer is shared from?It's a domain, not a Workgroup. But anyway... the mac IS connected to a *different* domain than the one the printer is on via mounted smb: drive.I would be glad to have you email me and check it out, maybe we could clarify the question a bit.How do I do it if the Print command is buried in a submenu? The menu path looks like this: File - > Print -> Print (the Print submenu contains the actual Print command, as well as Print Settings, Print Selected Text, Print to HTML, etc.)It shouldn't matter as long as you enter the item's menu name *exactly* as it appears in the menu itself. What's the application?Komodo Edit. I think because the menu name and action item are the same, it may be getting confused.And what is the question here?Why did this happen? i did not want those huge fonts. They were not there this morning. How do I get my old fonts back?To add to the comment, it added the shortcut to both the Print menu and the Print action item in the submenu. When I try using the shortcut (command+p), the File menu header flashes like it's trying to do something, but nothing actually happens.Added that info.I've been able to get to the normal OS X print options from Adobe, but after you select print to PDF, Adobe swoops in again and won't let you do it.  Arrggh.  The virtual printer tip should work but I was hoping for an easier solution.see my edit above.shift command comma is awesome, thanks for that.In the future, please leave the rant out of your question. We know you're frustrated, but isn't a great way to get your point across. Please take a look at the edit I've made and add any more info you think is relevant (screen caps may help). Thanks.Why it is better?@DevSolo: She's a programmer too, and her gaming rig is a desktop machine hooked up to the TV in the living room. She decided if she was going to get a new Mac Pro, she'd rather use it in her home office for development, and for the living room picked a cheaper HP box with fewer CPU cores but a kickin' GPU. "Which should I go for... faster compiles, or more fps on Fallout..." She, of course, went for the geekier choice. One of the many reasons I love her.got you. you're right.Have you considered making them HFS+ and using a tool like MacDrive on windows?No I haven't. I use them sometimes at college, so I'm limited to what I can install. The drives have to be both windows and Mac compatible.NTFS is both windows and mac compatible with NTFS-3G, and also supports rsync which I would recommend.What sort of files (text, compressed audio, whole system, etc.) are you dealing with?Ok, thanks. Anything and everything. Everything I download and anything personal to me is stored on the 320GB.@Moshe are you having performance issues with that machine? If anything I'd suspect you might be running out of RAM (hint: go 4GB).Thanks! I've never even looked in that particular preferences section.Thanks, just what I needed. Worth adding there is a bug in Mail where it will not play sounds on new mail if fetched by IMAP "idle" method rather than polling (see http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20081227031321447). Instead, I made an applescript to play a sound and called that in the Mail Rule, which works fine.Good question. A vague alternative could be SSH into a box what has a subversion client :o with the new Panic SSH client for iOS or a VNC connection. But let us know if you eventually decide to try one.Hmmm, first have to cancel my jetlag before flagging as duplicate... The one of yesterday was for MacOS, not iOS... Sorry :-/undeleting this in the hopes you switch to NTFSThe latest version of OS X your system will support is nearly always the best. Definitely max out the RAM, though. I have a 1.33 GHz iBook G4 running 10.5.8 and it runs great.It does slow occasionally, when I have several programs at once. Although, this was an academic question, TBH.It's impossible to objectively answer this question.Thanks :) that's helpfulThanks that's really nice!Hi I' not using a mac keyboard, what is the option button?Wow this is not at all what I said. 0.!@Charuru most probably `Alt`. I'll edit my answer, sorry for inconvenience!I disagree.  Answers might include: "the duration depends on the available network speed."  or "the duration depends on the how quickly Apple.com servers determine the necessary updates."   Would you suggest re-phrasing, such as "What is 'software update' doing when 'checking for new software?'"At least with cisco ASAs the admin can enforce wether or not to allow split tunneling.  If the network you're vpn'ing into is on 10/8 then a split tunnel is a routing config that forces all traffic to 10/8 over the VPN and all other traffic goes over the regular network.  The administrator can force the client to push all traffic over the VPN.  This is a "good thing" prevents someone from poping your home network and gaining access to the corp network.  That said, it's defeat-able by setting up your own routing with the route command.Also, VPN is not necessarily more secure than ssh, but it's a ton easier to manage.  One entry point vs. lots of entry points.  Control over who is accessing it.  The person running the VPN is likely not the person admin'ing your desktop.It would be a lot of guesswork, likely it is waiting for a response from the update server on if there are any updates, I see behavior similar to this on networks with redirected dns records for the apple update server, where it never responds.+1, that's cool and I didn't even think about it.Can you check the logs on the active directory server? I am not a user of AD generally, but if it is logging multiple attempts at a logging into the service, or some other bad behavior, I think that might be very useful. I have had users have mysterious errors that are almost always PEBKAC. Just nice people wanting to avoid looking bad.I think that one could answer this objectively. For example, someone could use some of the command line 'snoop' utilities to find out what SO is doing, or someone might know more about exactly what SO does than the rest of us. Of course, please make sure that all answers are factual; speculation probably isn't useful.`watch`is not bad too for tracking changes ;)`locate` and `updatedb: aliased to sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb` is not bad too ;)+1 for a cool app I haven't seen before, it reminds me of old school windows programs where one guy wrote like 20 different programs and put them all in one interface.Functionality, over form any day...@Nathan: iI'll concede that it may not be impossible, but it will certainly be difficult, so much so that I think there will be more speculative answers than worth the trouble of finding out what's going on. Seeing as how this question is about guessing then behavior of Apple software, and therefore Apple policy which we consistently close, I really don't see what change will be affected by lgeaving this open. It's not as though Apple is going to improve their software as a result of this. I don't see this question as having much benefit to the community at large.@Philip You are right that this will be hard to answer, but I'm not sure I see it as a matter of Apple *policy*. You are absolutely right that this won't change the software, but I think it's possible that someone will give the user a fix. In any case, I don't see this as a harmful question. However, if you feel that this question should be closed you should certainly do so. I reopened it because it had been edited and flagged for reopening, but you are the more experienced mod and I respect your decisions. Please, by all means, close this if you think you should. :)Although Disk utility uses `.sparseimage` as the extension for sparse disk images, you can rename it to `.dmg` as it's exactly that. (worth mentioning? hope so)It most *certainly* works that way on PCs. I can browse all over my network shares on my W7 box without a ***single*** hidden file being created anywhere. The fact that Macs need multiple utilities to make them behave that way speaks to nothing but a lack of caring from Apples engineers.The only hidden file I have ever seen W7 create is the ubiquitous "Thumbs.db" files, which is *only* created if you have thumbnails turned on, and is **very** easy to disable.The mac way, right :DFurthermore, the hidden files are ***demonstrably*** unnecessary. Blue Harvest ( http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest4/ ) actively deletes these hidden files as they are created, and OS X continues to work perfectly. **There is no excuse for the creation of all this filesystem cruft**.don't worry about the self-answer... that's actually encouraged to do it - as long as there's no other answer, such in this case.Just wondering... Why would you want that?Do you still have access to a windows computer?@Nathan: It's fine by me if we leave it open and let the community decide. I could have just taken a too strict interpretation of the FAQs.It is a question about Apple software. It's not really about the code aspect of programming, so I think it's OK here. It would probably also be at home on StackOverflow.Annoying, but just realized/found out that I had a .htaccess file sitting on my desktop, so useful as well, even if temporary.Mint also does *not* allow you to enter transactions proactively, or otherwise alter the register. All information in Mint has to be downloaded from a financial institution.I've tried iBank and ditched it because of its (at the time, at least) poor transaction download feature. I was used to an easy reconciliation process, and it was cumbersome. The interface is also somewhat chunky.+1 for MoneyWellThinking out loud here.  After I logged in successfully this morning something could have been trying to access a network resource which may have caused the account to lock for the user a few minutes later.  Can the account lock after it's already authenticated at the workstation?  I'll take a look at the server logs on Monday for any hints.  I also cranked up the Directory Services debugging log on the Mac.

Thanks for the help.

Kent@Kent: An account can lock out any time the number of unsuccessful logins within a particular amount of time (or consecutive) is reached. Have you looked in the Security log in the Event Viewer on the DC? That will tell you where the failing authentication is coming from.homebrew and macports together could have issues as macports will read files installed by homebrew and they will not necessarily be the correct versiontrue, but 95% of time there is no major issue, and for remaining 5% cases, just changing temporarily the $PATH is often the solution... I prefer brew for ease and lightweight, but macports has *many* more packages we will probably never see in homebrew...Thanks for the suggestion, Cawas. Will have a look at that.@Cawas. Thanks, have done! :-)Just in case it's simply of matter of your not *seeing* it despite it being there somewhere, slide your pages of apps in Springboard to the right until Spotlight search appears and type `spark` -- if the app appears then it's somewhere on your iPad already.Hmm... it seems to work in project or symbol view, unless you're in symbol view and clicked on a protocol. ThanksThanks. Ironically I was not able to "right" click on my macbook white... Just attach the mouse eject the dam thing..I wish! I don't think contextual items work in 10.6. This program didn't work for me, and I recall the Finder SVN plugin also cannot work in 10.6.Should still be able to hold the trackpad and eject it if I remember correctly.possible duplicate of [Create new file from contextual menu](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2589/create-new-file-from-contextual-menu)In case you haven't thought of doing this, I'm guessing the best bet here would be replicating the SVN into a web repository of some sort. HTML5 baby! :PNo. That is an FM broadcaster, not an FM receiver. The intention with that device is for you to plug that into your iPhone/iPod in order to broadcast iPod/other app music, and use a stereo (perhaps in your car or bedroom, or even living room) to listen to what your phone is playing.Note also that the iPod Nano (current and previous generation, IIRC?) is to the best of my knowledge the ONLY mobile Apple device that has had an FM receiver in it.Oh, then is there any device like this to use as a FM reciever. Should I delete my answer?I saw this app when it appeared, and I got it. I'm very confused about the lists it displays. There's some kind of points system going on but I can't figure out what it means. The dev's homepage doesn't even list the app, so no help there.@torbengb the big number really isn't that obvious, but it simply shows how many times you've opened the app. I believe the rest of the list is evident enough.Did you clear your DNS cache after switching DNS servers?Good answer. The best thing to remember is that the OS is really supposed to be handling this for you.If you are looking to find 'Any extra useful keyboard shortcuts/commands?' in general, please make that a separate post. I've changed your title accordingly for this question. Thanks!For now I'm using [Picbox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picbox-upload-your-camera/id400746312?mt=8), but that's still not it...I actually use [Picbox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picbox-upload-your-camera/id400746312?mt=8) for doing that, though it's still not as perfect as [I wish](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10733/automaticly-and-seamlessly-sync-iphone-photos-as-soon-as-theyre-taken) (instant sync the second I take the photo).This is what happens, but on the device itself - not on iTunes. Now the question persists... How to disable those warnings? What if I just don't want to update / upgrade?THe thing is, I cant!If the install disc won't boot at all, that indicates a problem with the install disc itself, nothing to do with the previous Ubuntu installation. I'd check the disc over very carefully for scratches, smudges, or fingerprints."I was wondering ..." is a statement that implies a question - no "?" required.You should be able to boot from the install disk even if there isn't a hard drive in it *at all* (though it wouldn't do much use).I don't see one, so it is probably applescript to the rescueI'll give this a shot next time I'm I get an OS update and see how it goes. Will post my result afterwards.It can't be on purpose, there's nothing in it for Apple to insist you use Safari and anything that gets between you and a purchase is downright bad for them.Like I said, its either a bug or a feature.@mipadi: I know Mail supports IMAP, but Hotmail does not. I might have phrased my question slightly awkwardly but I just want a mail client that works with Hotmail and uses some synchronizing protocol like IMAP etc.As with most businesses... they make it "easier" for you to pay againIn a word - Yes. It is difficult to get non-Microsoft clients to work with a service that MS specifically designed to work poorly with such clients. Now that you understand the phrase "vendor lock-in," you have a choice to make - switch to a service that supports vendor-neutral standards such as IMAP, or return to the vendor that's trying to hold you hostage to their proprietary non-standards.How do you copy the content to the iPad? oPlayer doesn't seem to able seeing itunes content...I especially mentioned that this approach would not work for meNot like you said: I'm saying no, definitely not a feature, definitely a bug.What's that photo? Is that taken with a camera very close to the screen? I'd see if it's visible in a screenshot on another computer, if it's visible on an external monitor, and what it looks like with the screen zoomed. To zoom the screen, Cmd+Scroll Up. You may need to enable this accessibility feature in the Universal Access prefpane.It's the same with all apps in iTunes, which is not very intuitive. In iTunes:

1. Select your iPad
2. Select Apps Tab
3. On bottom you will have an app listing with associated files, use this to add your videosI finally got exactly what you showed. Very strange... Maybe the first time I clicked on the "debut-extension" icon... Should buy new glasses :pAnd the configuration is OK now. The only problem is it's really slow, and much slower when I go from the finder than using the terminal (ls /afs/cell.name/ ...).I managed to solve the issue. I downloaded DoubleCommand and selected Control key acts as Command Key and hit Activate. Works perfectly now.Thanks for the information, now I know why the command key is next to the CTRL key , its because of the windows keyboard. Still didn't help me to much because command key(windows on my keyboard) didn't work with those key combination's. Seems I had to download DoubleCommand and switch command key with CTRL and works great now.@scarface Good to know ... doesn't really help me though.Although the article doesn't use favicons at all (which is probably because of the reasons you mentioned). He copies a partial screenshot to the clipboard and uses it as an icon.If you say so, I have no way of knowing that with certainty without doing a lot more debugging or by being the person who wrote it.@Martin, @Cawas, @mspasov: I have updated my question to better guide answers. These are all great suggestions.@wrick have you tried using the [same Exchange Active Sync settings](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/08/30/hotmail-now-supports-push-email-calendar-and-contacts-with-exchange-activesync.aspx) on the Mac as you have on your iPhone? What I've understood, Hotmail doesn't have IMAP support so using IMAP is as impossible as browsing webpages using a FTP client.I cant remember, does the iphone even have man pages? Was this route command installed as a part of the jailbreak? What happens when you run it with no parameters? Even if it isnt the same command it probably behaves similarly.+1 for trac, I love it and it is great.@hobs This command is installed when you install Cydia on your phone, in package _network_cmds_. There seems no manpages in Cydia. I've updated the info in my question :-)Yeah I think you just have the bsd version of route, I dont know how to use it much, but the man page is http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=route, thats the same route command if you type it into your mac.This looks like a more user friendly intro to route on bsd http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/freebsd-setup-default-routing-with-route-command/Honestly the Finder sometimes has issues over network shares. I would check Console.app and see if it is complaining about anything before any big changes, but the Finder does things like index all the files, build thumbnails, spotlight can get involved, and other things that make hobs :(. There are a couple of posts about that around here, some people even use completely alternate file browsers for that reason. Sorry that I cant be of more help!Yeah, I have seen a firmware update go wrong and do this, and the actual hardware go wrong and do this, :(I agree, and that's exactly what I bought: the 2.0GHz, HR screen, and 7200RPM HD.The Dev tools in Safari (some say the same) are just not there yet so I stick with Chrome for Dev. If Apple update Safari in the next release then we will see.Little to slow for me. Look forward to future releases.I keep going for Visor to Window and have now stuck with Visor. Great App.it's a shame apple doesn't recognize this issue.  but thanks for the help, it works.Interesting, thanks, I'll take a look, seems like an improvement on DropPhoxThank you, Kevin. That's right;however, that way you just go through the tabs, but can never see the title of the tab.What version of iOS are you using?IO performance will make much more of a difference than a minor CPU difference.

Local Notification I can understand, but surely that doesn't take much CPU time. GPS tracking (e.g. Google Latitude App) really turns itself back on automatically after rebooting?When you say "The only option it gives..." What is "it"?

And, what happens after you put the password in? Does the wifi icon show up at all? Do you get an error message?I wholeheartedly vote for the SSD. I have a 2008 MBP (C2D 2.6GHz) that I've recently installed an SSD in, and it feels like I bought a new machine. It's the single best upgrade you can make to any machine.Macs come with curl.

A lot simpler.  See http://ss64.com/bash/sleep.html

I would load Chrome and Firefox last in the script, so the sleep time should be minimal.// Thank you!

Ask you admin about allowing a split tunnel.  There should be a setting in your VPN software that allows you to have only the traffic that needs the VPN go over the vpn.Instead of manually disabling/enabling WiFi when I leave/return home, is there any way to do this  automatically?

But here is another problem. You cannot copy folders and if you have like a few thousand videos in separated folders you have to drop all the files into the same place and it will be a  really long list in oPlayer. OMG why in the world it has to be so complicated. I just wanted to see a few damn training video courses. Damn you Apple.Is that exclusive to the iPodTouch? I don't see that option when I connect my iPhone 4 to iTunes.Well, now I don't have to convert those files, but because of that stupid iTunes doesn't give shit that there is something in the world what we call folders or directories, now I have to merge videos if there is more than one file in a course, and yes there is always not just more than one but usually hundreds of them. I can imagine how heavy the file would be after the merge.Yeah sounds like lag on the usb port.  Anyway, hope the above answers your question.

I can't think of anything else though.like your tip of holding down 6 and 4 key at bootupIndeed it would be so much simpler that an iDevice act as an USB key, apps accessing freely to that shared space.

What a strange world isnt? :)I don't think this will work for non-Pro MacBooks.Wrong. HFS+ will not work in a linux router.1) Apart from itunes document share, SortSshots also provides an inbuilt FTP Server and you can transfer files wirelessly to SortShots by using any standard FTP client like Filezila. So in other words, start FTP server on Sortshots, start FTP client on your PC/Mac, connect to Sortshots and transfer files as you do with regular FTP.3) The third point regarding photo app.. well that is something which is beyond control as it is due to limitations imposed by Big Apple on third party developers and apps.Hope this helps. Please feel free to write us should you have any questions Thanks,
Sortshots TeamNot really the kind of question that will receive proper attention in this community as far as I can tell.  But, I would hypothesize WWDC, and not free, but probably cheap.@harv you really think it's going to be cheap? I see more something like Leopard release price.Ah yes. Misread that it wasn't a pro.I've found two potential "off-shelf" solutions which might hit the requrements namely: http://www.e-detailing.co.uk/ and http://www.pitcherapp.com/. Both cost a bit but they allow you to wrap up whatever content you like in a C# application shell which can be installed via an organisation's enterprise app store.can i do voice chat from ipad without having earphone and external mic. Is inbuilt mic availabe inside ipad?I thought it applied to both, the other thing I would think is the album art cache is corrupted, you can remove iTunes\Album Artwork\Cache while itunes isnt running, and see if that helps.Ah, the number being the app-start count makes sense and a quick test confirms it. Even when multitask-switching rather than using the springboard.The problem is Safari doesn't even notice that the string changed. The src is still ending in *.jpg even though the server delivers it as *.png@andrej can you accept [g .'s answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8491/mail-app-and-multiple-copies-of-emails/8580#8580)?@Lars Have you checked that it works on a desktop browser? And are you definitely going to exactly the same URL? If you know it's working on the desktop, email the URL to your iPhone and click on the link. Just checking the obvious, because it sounds like a server problem rather than an iPhone one.Yes I did check it in Firefox with User Agent Switcher and it works fine there. The URL is definitely the same. But maybe it could be the Drupal that is used for that site?Ah yes... didn't think of that. Clear Drupal's cache. It could be that you are not logged in on Drupal, so it is showing you a cached version of the page. Go to admin/settings/performance - clear cache is at the bottom.Mine doesn't seem to provide anything fof that. Only drivers, firmware and some basic tools for configuration (http://bit.ly/dZ1ECn)Agree with Petruza, I've installed VLC on OSX multiple times, zero problems.I think the talkone is like viber16 GB is way too expensive... maybe in a few months for my new mbp.I have a specific, audible ringtone that I use for those numbers that I wish to ignore, but silence is a great idea. I hadn't thought of that. The only downside to either solution is that the number has to be kept in the Address Book in order for it work.Can you elaborate a bit more? The signature looks bigger when you look at it in gmail, or when you send to someone at a gmail account and they reply? Also, do you notice anything else different (like is it actually using a different font)? It could be that there's something in your signature that can't be displayed in gmail so it alters your format. I just sent a test message from Mail to my Gmail account and back and didn't notice any difference, but I was using the default font settings (Helvetica 12pt). (Sorry, I don't have the rep yet to post this as a comment.)There IS a lot apps to access gtalk. BUT, the best app for that is no doubt the BeejiveIM app.Just have Terminal open in the background at login if you don't like the load time.@Nathan I can't afford it RAM is limited on my machine as I only have 2GB on the machine that needs it most of the time. Im really just trying to make myself lazy. As i've already added a link from Safari to sad for typing mistakes.2GB should be enough for Terminal so if it is slow to start there could be other reasons - e.g. things in your shell start up scripts e.g. .profileBut you would have to do this prep for every different command you wanted to run with Spotlight?No OSX has serious memory issues. Especially when you don't clean up your system regularly, I would if I had time to do this but my main machine is in use 24/7.If you read the next sentence "An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge", the key words are "all the time".  Don't treat it like a desktop.  Periodically use it the laptop while unplugged.  This is not the same a unplugging it every time the battery is full.Honestly my life was much simpler before I bought an iPad. I really think I'm gonna jump on android tablet pretty much soon when it gets better. I never needed that stupid itunes on my computer before. Only once, when I wanted to see Jobs keynote on apple.com, it asked for itunes I told it to go to hell and watched the keynote a few hours later on youtube. Huge, damn stupid, laggy and worst piece of software that I ever used on PC since era of windows 95.Does Synchronize sync the contents non-Inbox IMAP folders?  Example, when I move a message from Inbox to another folder and then do a Synchronize - will I see that message no longer in the Inbox but in the other folder on a web client or other client?@Cedric: AES-NI as you can tell from its name, is an instruction set to speed up encryption and decryption AES. It makes whole disk encryption more "native".Vt-d allows virtualized guest speaks directly with host's IO devices, which is often the main bottleneck of a virtualization system.@Owen For your example, Mail should already have taken care of doing that for you. You should only `Synchronize` if you moved your mail to another folder, went to the web interface and saw that the mail is still in the inbox (maybe if there was a network problem, or something). I'll update my answer.I tried it before, but alt-e doesn't work as Control-E. I guess it can't be a perfect solution.:) how to do that?How does the mac get an internet connection, same ethernet port?Not a fix, but usually if you put it BACK to sleep it also will come back, the same thing happens to me with iMacs all the time where the screen lights up and no login is presented, all black. I just press the power button on the back to put it back to sleep and it wakes back up.+1 This is what I do. Yes, you have to add the number to the address book, but I have a group conveniently called: BlockedTards ;)no the mac gets it from it's airport and shares it to the ethernet connectionright clicking on the file in the playlist or ctrl click on the little arrow in the 'now playing' pane at the topThanks !Would you consider editing this question to make it more relevant to Mac OS X? General beginner mysql questions might get better answers at Stack Overflow. Also do read the FAQ so you are less likely to ask questions that read like "what book can I study to learn mysql on mac?" Cheers and welcome nevertheless!Note that this only affects whether a 32 or 64 bit kernel is used. Both can still run 32 or 64 bit applications, and 64 bit applications are always the default if the processor is 64 bit. However, the default kernel is 32 bit because, as you have seen, some third-party extensions don't work with a 64-bit kernel yet.Thanks for that clarification, and the tip as well!Yeah I could see Apple using this in their Facetime stuff.Did some other article tell you to change the dns, gateway, search domain, proxy etc? What if all that were default, as when the mac is sharing it is supposed to have a rudimentary dhcp server and forward dns requests properly.Have you tried deleting evernote/growl? Do you have the install DVD? (To perform a full disk repair) I dont think growl can have such an effect on a mac.  Do you have an external hard-drive with a Time Machine Backup? I suggest getting one, for occasions like this one. I never thought Id need it, but it saved my life a couple months ago...I have also seem people saying this because comcast's dns was messing with their settings, and switching to 8.8.8.8 aka Google's DNS worked for their Apple TV.Do you get a 169.254 address or nothing at all?I can't be sure DNS isn't involved - but generally when DNS is problematic - things are too slow to start or never start instead of degrading mid connection / mid stream. It's possible and a good suggestion when this error happens immediately on the initial play request - just pretty unlikely from the specifics of this question.Neither. I can access it fine on my iPod without doing anything more than selecting it from the network list (after pressing "Forget this network" of course). I can also manually enter a valid IP on my MBP and be connected quite fine; the issue seems to only be the DHCP.A 169.254... addressYeah I know, its weird. Thats why I wouldnt even post it in an answer, its too disconnected for me to feel like it has a logical leapDid uninstall evernote and Growl. Some time ago, some other app wanted to install Growl causing similar issue. Thought it was fixed but obviously not. Now I can not even login to my profile. It just hangs with the beach ball of "death"... :(All hardware tests, standard / extended pass. Reinstalling the 10.2 from a CD right now and it hasn't shutdown yet. Looks like we've got a heisenbug - it goes away upon investigation.I took it to the Apple Store. They gave me a new phone.You can't have a voicemail message that responds only to certain numbers.  So the problem with this solution is that everybody who gets the voicemail will hear this.  Not sure that my mother would want to hear this :)   That said, its not a bad solution in the short term if the pest that calls is doing it often.Are you selecting DHCP with manual address or static IP?How long have you had your mac? .asl files are generally the result of logging, and if you had a user specific log file going nuts, I could see that causing something like this.I suggest you download  [Onyx](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11582/onyx). Maybe you have heard about it: it is very useful to give maintenance to you mac. Hope it helps :/+1 for the Web interface.Hit with a know exploit? Don't buy into that. Auto Updates should never be on if you want your computer to run optimal.  It's just junk littering your computer. Anyways, I want to know of a work around for Safari working without these two programs.Depends on how he wants to go about it, it can be done."Auto Updates should never be on if you want your computer to run optimal. It's just junk littering your computer." That's a pretty silly thing to say. Try attending a BlackHat conference.Setting it to "full" DHCP produces the self-assigned addresses. Static IP worked fine (with up-to-date details). I just cleared the NVRAM and we'll see tomorrow if that did anything at all.@RobZolkos ok, but in iTunes I don't have Device List either Apple TV on it, but I can stream content to it.Do you have the new AppleTV or the older one with internal hard drive?@Nathan Be that as it may, MacPorts/libusb-devel wants to install its own curl.I have a new one, black. I bought it last week in Apple Store at Las Vegas.You won't be able to sync to it. It has no internal storage.The 2nd generation does have internal storage (8 GB). It is used as a cache during streaming. Unfortunately Apple doesn't allow you to store content there for other purposes.thank you all..this one can be download from iTunes, yes, but would be nice if it can be downloaded from the web as well+1 thanks, I'll check it out. Does it let you edit the metadata too?What do you use?iTunes :)   Why don't you use iTunes?  Is it due to the flac support?  There is this http://code.google.com/p/flukeformac/Yeah they have iAds, which is new, I hadn't updated in a while I guess :(..  They seem to come and go though, or only be visible at first maybe. Sometimes they are there other times not.How can that work without a dhcp server on any of the ethernet connections? Does the iMac automaticly act as dhcp server when it's set to share it's connection?Yes it sure does!What are the main features you would like to keep for the new tool and, most important, why do you need something else?Thank You, and can you please check the EDITs in my question, and reply back.Please check edits in my questionThank You once again.Out of MacJournal and Memoires, what is your personal recommandation for my needs. Any one please.@RobZolkos I've done what you suggest and I have a small archive.zip (7mb) and the segments (64mb each). However, I cannot unzip the content, I'm running unzip unix archive.zip but I get "bad zipfile offset (lseek)". Furthermore, I need to extract them in Windows environment as well, and there I only have Windows 7 extractor I guess.-1: sendmail is the SMTP server commandyou just need to run unzip archive.zip   I'm just checking windows now.@RobZolkos I've already tried and I added to the question the error I get.I just tested it on a folder and it worked fine.  Both zipping and unzipping.  Make sure to unzip in a different folder than the original source.  

On Windows it doesn't unzip.  However a freeware unzip program 7Zip http://www.7-zip.org/   can unzip them without a problem.ok cool. I'll try thisThanks :) Much Appreciated.Thanks :) Much Appreciated.It isn't Adobe that's not allowing you to use Flash on the iPad, it's Apple.@RobZolkos I get "unsupported compression method" error, do you think the issue is with at extraction step or compression step?+1 for terminal and the often-underused Applescript variation, which are both perfect. I would, however, suggest that you introduce a confirmation dialogue if you put this Applescript application in your Dock (to avoid ruining your day if you accidentally clicked it)!@msanford Thank you! The applescript will ask for your password, so if you changed your mind or accidentally clicked it, then you may just click on cancel!This is good info.  I use Google Voice most of the time so, I was hoping for something that would work with that.Is there a particular reason why are you reinstalling the OS annually in the first place? I haven't had to do anything like that since System 9, and even then that was probably superfluous.this worked, thanks.  logged into router, the "channel" was set to 6.  Changed it to 1, which was the lowest option, and connected fine.Tons of junk on the machine I no longer need and I like starting clean. Don't think that question really aligns itself with the original question, though.Sweet idea, nice service. I upvote this one!Of course it does. Reinstalling the OS removes all of the system-level caches and backups that are used to maintain the link between your iTunes installation and your iOS devices. If you simply stopped repeatedly wiping the Mac, or were more careful with what you placed on your hard drive, then this problem would go away.My entire box is always backed up, onsite and offsite. I simply want to avoid loading a hundred epubs and PDFs onto my iPad/iPhone every time I format.Philip is right, there are less destructive/time-consuming ways of dealing with clutter than wiping the OS.I'll give that a shot and check back. Thanks much!my apologies. I was referring to addressbook lookup, not Caller Id.@Raj: I have updated my answer per your comment.The funky part is that the format does not matter to Text/SMS messages, but it does while showing who's calling!I never knew about that command -- thanks!I too reformat/reinstall all of my machines every year or so, it is just habit and I will not be changing it anytime soon. You should be able to recreate your entire iTunes library from your backup with no problem before you sync.And yeah, just read the FAQ stating that it is not for buying recommendations, but I'm more interested in what specs and hardware I should be looking for.For the sake of sanity - let's assume this question is about a normal "locked" phone that expects a specific carrier's SIM to be installed and the OP is using a SIM from that carrier. Let's also assume it doesn't show in iTunes and can't have apps installed and is completely stuck at the emergency screen.Sounds interesting, though I have to say for the amount of money that I paid for FC, I was hoping to avoid having to purchase *another* program (not to mention wishing to avoid having two additional programs in the process of just importing digital video). Once I have a chance to test, I'll give this a shot and see if it corrects the issue and I'll accept if I can't get a better solution. Thanks!Had to do some things with the MySQL root user password encryption `UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=OLD_PASSWORD('NewPassword') WHERE User='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`had to comment one line on the script, once that creates the symbolic link@adam-robinson In that case you can use [Log & Transfer](http://support.apple.com/kb/ta24840) to import from your camera, directly to Final Cut. Then you have to deinterlace the video, using Final Cut's deinterlace filter, or a 3rd party plugin.@adam-robinson ..but in that case, the videos can only be imported from your camcorder. I mean that Log & Transfer does not supports imports from internal folders (in case you've copied the files)Why not edit the question to improve things a bit? Ask at what point did people outgrow a basic macbook for video editing purposes. Maybe specify what sort of video you are taking? I'll assume it's iPhone 4 quality or less (which is actually quite amazing). If you are not shooting HD with expensive lenses, my feeling is that nothing from the past 2 years Apple sold is "too slow" Getting answers about people outgrowning the basic kit and software will be useful to others and indirectly get you info for your recommendation.@mindless.panda: You are making far too many assumptions right now about how people use their Macs. Please mind your tone.Ooh - a meta question that's so meta it wraps back to be a good iOS usage question.-1. If you have done this multiple times on the Mac, then you should provide Mac instructions rather than just a link that kind of explains it with a Windows-only application. The question specifically mentions a MBP.Additionally, if you still want to use Amazon S3 on your Mac, one of the best alternatives I've found is Arq ($): http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/ The Developer is friendly and you can even ask him if there are chances of reusing your data.Wow - that's a great trick and hacky in the sense of discovering something about how it works. I'm wondering if there are unintended consequences to doing this when things are not really in sync. What if iTunes doesn't have all the books already - do they transfer back or will the OP lose everything?Nuc, but of course it will ask with "with administrator privileges". Duh. Problem solved and caveat retracted. ;)Let's all just answer the question asked and do less questioning of the motives of the OP. I think imaginitive has asked a stellar question that will get some good answers that will get honed to become "the" answer to the question asked.David - the problem is that the syncing gets broken so the normal mechanism needs care to avoid an empty library from overwriting data on the device.I changed the permissions to Read & Write for everything, and watched the console, but nothing happened. I tried to convert the MP3's to MP3's with iTunes but it gave me an error saying the files are write protected or of the wrong type.  The files seem fine. I'm just going to start from scratch@Nuc (Just FYI, replacing spaces with hyphens in responses will prevent the user from getting a notification of your message) I've tried that, but FC doesn't recognize my camera as a capture source. I'm not sure the device implements the camera profile, just the removable storage profile.@mjrider: We need more information to go by to help. What type of iMac do you have? Have you looked in Activity Monitor to be sure it is MS Office?Still no clue as to what is causing the lock-ups.  Manually entering our DNS servers in Network settings, rather than getting them from DHCP, appears to have solved the issue, again.  I don't have the log from last Friday so I can't check it, but recent logs appear normal.I am relatively new to the mac platform so I have not tried the activity monitor (but I will when I go in next)ghoppe - that's the most awesome answer I've seen on which ports provide **extra** power while awake for things like iPad and iPhone charging. Power to charge iOS devices flows from the MacBook Pro if it goes to sleep with the device connected or if there is magsafe power and the device gets connected while the mac is sleeping (which actually wakes up the mac). Basically sleep power to USB depends on wall power, display lid up/down, and the order in which events happen.When you get in, go into About This Mac in the Apple menu and get the processor and memory shown in there. Activity Monitor will show all of the processes that are running in the system. There are other things like Spotlight that can slow things down as well, but AM will tell you for sure what's going on. Also noting when things get sluggish would help as well.@Kent: Looking at the logs after you've patched the problem won't help, unfortunately. You'll have to be able to get the lockout to occur again and check the log for it to be of any value.@Kent: You also can probably get more help on this issue if you post on serverfault.com instead of here. It sounds more like an AD configuration issue than something specific to OSX (even if the workstation with the issue is running OSX)This is a loaded question that borders on unanswerable but rather than down vote it and close it - please edit it to make it more clear. There is no technical reason why a program can not be crafted to render flash, but it surely won't be hosted for sale or distribution on the Apple store anytime soon. It seems you are confusing things - VNC isn't "running on the iPad" What do you really want to know and edit the question to ask that.dear lord ebuddy is evil! http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/ybenjamin/detail?entry_id=46417  search for ebuddyYou can use iChat with Google Talk and Voice, but unfortunately not the normal landline/cell calls.I think the question could be correctly stated as : Is there any current way to view flash content on an iPad? As that is what a VNC connection to a desktop computer running a flash video would net you, albeit crappily.And speaking of him, there is VERY interesting news coming from the Apple lawsuit against Samsung. [link] (http://www.asymco.com/2011/04/19/review-of-apples-unit-numbers-released-in-legal-filing-prior-to-earnings/)I would recommend trying iWork, as it does everything an average joe would need plus more.  It's dead simple to use/learn, and personally, I feel it's better than word.I manually update all of my programs. It is ridiculous to have every program installed to have extra programs to run in the background to check for updates.  They are all resource hogs. It's pointless to have a program running all the time to just check for an update to that program. It's not for safety...it's for them to have their program more embedded into your computer.Although I haven't tried the command in the terminal your link pointed me to the right direction. Thank you! I installed Zend Server CE that day which created a System-User causing this problem...Awesome, glad to help.Not iptables, ipfw. Iptables is for linux. Same idea though everything packet related can be done.Yeah I got Alfred about an hour ago and have been using it as I rebuild my machine.  It is a great app and I am sure I will continue to use it but really bummed about not have an app launcher with custom triggers.Yeah, there is a thread on getsatisfaction on that right now http://getsatisfaction.com/alfredapp/topics/keyboard_triggers , I dont know if they will ever have as good of support for triggers as quicksilver :(Do you mean the airport express is trying to send DNS packets to your macbook and you don't think it should?+1 for I didn't think about this before and I want it.Cool looks like Alfred will be adding the core of the functionality.  QS was extremely easy and Alfred may require some more work for custom triggers, but hey if QS is dead I will happily work with this other alternative.The problem with LaunchBar (which is terrific and I use it on one of my Macs) is that it is a great QuickSilver replacement except that it doesn't do what the original poster wants, which is triggers from the keyboard. So with LB, you can't, for example, hit F5 to launch Mail.@debug for someone who just purchased Office 2011, I wouldn't.hmmm blacktree is still hosting b58 as the latest and no reference to b59.  that link you post doesn't show up near the top of a search on QS so I never would have found it.well just loaded up b59 and the same problem exist that I mentioned in my original post.  man i got excited for a min. maybe i will come back with b60If I try and sign up for a new account it tells me my member name has already been taken, which is from my existing account.  I just need to upgrade my free account but can't see how.As a third party developer I have to agree that asking questions of this nature asks people to break their NDAs with Apple. Please either join the dev program and ask in the appropriate venues or wait. Sorry to be a spoil sport here.+1 Use vs. buy - that's a **very** good point.Are all of your triggers simply launching apps from keypresses? FastScripts by Red Sweater is perfect for mapping keypresses to scripts http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/ A one line applescript could be written for each app you want to launch.Apple explicitly allows renewal of trial Mobile Me memberships. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1062I assume you use Ctrl-a too often to get used to Ctrl-a (release ctrl) a to send Ctrl-a to the shell? - The problem with Cmnd-a is that it is the builtin for "Select All Text", which I am not sure how you will be able to undo.it isn't compleatly out of the question...it is kinda annoing ...I am kinda wondering if anyone else has had the problem...not what to replace it with@VxJasonxV hmm, I may be able to live with Ctrl-a,a but yeah I will probably mess it up too often. If Cmd-a won't work I'd settle for something like Shift-Cmd-a.Yep I am aware, I just assumed it wasn't an actual trial as he said he didn't see the reactivate link. My mistake.Don't do this. Flash eats batteries and offers security holes. There are reasons Apple doesn't support Flash on iOS. Pay attention to them, they know what hey are talking about.Funky is GOOD! Keeps us on our toes!Yes, that is exactly it.Thank you very much! :-)Sounds like an issue with compression.  Is what you're compressing just standard files?Have you tried searching for the given file name?I wouldn't rely on the report from a single scanner to be definitive. When you do locate the file have it checked by one of the on-line scanners, such as http://www.virustotal.com, for confirmation. Sophos has a very poor track record for false positives.Also check to see that the drive partition formation is GUID, not MBR.yes, good point.  So partition as GUID (hit Option button at bottom of Disk Utility window) and then format as HFS+ (select from drop down on right of Disk Utility window).Do you mean preview using QuickLook (ie pressing space bar) or open the files with the Preview app?Agree, and would add one point: disk space. Probably the most important factor. Id say it should at least cover the space your computer has, AS A MINIMUM. But if you really want something to never worry about loosing old files, Id say at least duplicate your space.Time Machine will prompt you to let it format/partition the drive as needed so having it pre-formatted may save some time but isn't a deal breaker if you find an otherwise suitable drive.@RobZolkos I mean when you browse in a Finder window in column view, when you select a file and the finder loads info about that file in the next column (is that QuickLook?)I read both of those articles already. The first one did nothing (but I don't believe it would apply to my machine anyhow). The second one assumes you've already installed windows.Pretty hard without a boot dvd as to do a proper and thorough partition, clean and format the main drive needs to me unmounted and not being used by the system.  Any chance you could lay your hands on one?Do you have access to another Mac? If so, you could put your MacBook into Firewire Target Disk mode and use the other Mac to try to repair your damaged drive.Does it show up in System Profiler, USB?Which MacOS X version are you using?Leopard and Snow Leopard.is it a bluetooth mouse?Thanks, I 'll try this.the mouse is connected with a cable. A bluetooth device.. hmm, good idea.Aah, be aware.  That is not related to what I was talking about.  The channel is analogous to the channel on a TV.  Depending on surrounding devices, you will get better or worse reception by virtue of interference.  Still, changing the channel from the default, 6, is a good move regardless.thanks very much!possible duplicate of [Why doesn't Microsoft Office/2008(& later) support RTL languages?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3/why-doesnt-microsoft-office-2008-later-support-rtl-languages)Yeah with bluetooth you have this option. Not with wired :(Even just resizing the FAT32 partition a little (rather than a full reformat) and then making a HFS+ partition sufficient for all your files on the Mac Mini, then using Carbon Copy Cloner may be an option for you. +1 for CCC - very useful utility. [GParted](http://gparted.sourceforge.net/) can shrink FAT32 partitions.I have used the profilinf command and it did not show any info as well. I also saw that Apple increased the warranty on the graphics card because of a too high number of failures on the specific card.thank you for the nice suggestion. but why Apple (or Microsoft) do not provide a real solution to this huge problem ? this is really so annoying :(Not that gut feelings learnt under Windows don't necessarily work under OSX. e.g. reformatting does not often give much improvement. Little effect on disk and possibly better to use activity monitor to see what takes up CPU. (+ add RAM)Thanks for the clear answers! I will report back on how long it took iTunes to sync my 270 apps. ;)@Faisal I agree, I think it's because business competition but I am not sure.32 bit or 64 bit windows 7?While the second one does assume you installed windows, reset the smc and pram anyway, I have read reports of this fixing it, as the pram holds the last booted disc in memory if I remember correctly. I have also seen reports of connecting a secondary monitor helping the issue.Instagram for me saves to the Camera Roll, the original and the processed one.I'm upvoting the 'sudo find' option.+1 for Camera+, as well as how my Instagram is setup to do this.Marvelous! I'll try it, thanksHave you tried @Gesher links?@AdamRobinson Thank you for pointing this out :) - If Log & Transfer does not work, then unfortunately you'll have to rely to a third-party tool to transcode the videos, prior importing them to final cut.Keep in mind this could be unrelated to the update and just a hardware failure, which still can be as simple as pushing the SIM Recipient hard enough to the bottom or a broken SIM Reader really complicated to replace. Both happened to me in different iPhones.Funnily is a a funny word@Stefan your comment is more appropriate to the original question (how to run Flash) than to my answer which is just a technical solution to the Q. Flash eats batteries but I'm sure the OP knows this, and any use uses batteries. Security holes? Sure. You need them to jailbreak, so I'm glad they are there. And Apple does not always know best.Well I just changed everything on the Ubuntu machine back to blank and dhcp. It doesn't work. I can ping the iMac but nothing else answers me.Yes. I'm a little confused by the step two. "Step Two
***If you are already on iOS 4.2.1 you can skip this step. If you are on an unlockable baseband and on a lower firmware you should use PwnageTool instead to update without upgrading your baseband." My baseband isn't unlockable, but I don't worry about it. So, it seems that I can follow completely this guide without choosing the baseband upgrade when it is prompted (and without using PwnageTool), doesn't it?@bmike - I've used this to transfer content from my phone back over to iTunes after replicating the library ID. I can't vouch for how books work because I don't use that functionality much. Your answer about transferring purchased content would help out in that situation, but I think he's loaded his own files as well that aren't store content.You have this option with a wired mouse. Unplug it.great trick. Often the first thing I want to do on a new iTunes install is enable manual management of music/videos - but this can't be enabled unless the device is linked to the library, which will wipe the device. Can you confirm that access to the File Sharing in the Apps tab will work before linking (and so wiping) of the iOS device?Are the epubs and PDFs not part of the device backup?So how would I tranfer my phone number and contacts? If I go to AT&T to upgarde, how would they move my data?Good point. I forgot that you can boot from MBR, just not install to an MBR partition drive.Phone number would be reassigned to a new sim, if you have your contacts on your sim card, go to settings>mail contacts and calendars>import sim contats, then sync them with a computer/mobile account. Most of the time ATT can read the contents of the sim card and put it on a flash drive, but I have seen proprietary formats in the past. Other backups stuff should go through http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4137 (how to backup and restore your iPhone as a new device)What a pain. I guess I'll skip this upgrade route for now.Actually, could I just take an iPhone 4 to an AT&T store and have them move my number and such? I don't need to buy the phone from AT&T/Apple, right?Thanks,Works perfectlyOh, we've got one of those for the guests. But our folks like to be able to walk into a meeting room, pop open the macbook and hop right on the wifi.Thanks! I'll try this next time I see this user. I'll let you know what I find.I'll try resetting the smc and pram tonight, and I'll let you know if that works.Usually that data transfer is when they first upgrade your phone, I havent seen them offer it to existing iPhone owners, but you could see if they would transfer them for you. *Honestly the article approach is much better than letting AT&T go at it*Not really a OS X tip, but an emacs tip.If you are a command line hacker, having caps lock as control is pretty essential in my book.Not an answer (so not posted as an answer), but I'm very happy with the paid version of Pandora - I just re-upped for my second year. Not sure if the endorsement is helpful or not.It would be really nice to turn it off. I run the updater when I want to know whether a new update is ready or not. I don't want to waste my resources (battery, CPU) on unwanted updates.Microsoft has now "Exchange-enabled" all hotmail accounts. http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/08/windows-live-hotmail-gets-exchange-activesync.arsSweet! Any joy on that alternate monitor?How nice looking are you looking for? Checking mp3 pedometer -apple in google shopping brings some fugly but supposedly functional results.I'm not worried about my data or even contacts - I have those backed up. I'm worried about my phone number. I want to keep the same number on the new phone.I'm closing this for two reasons: 1) As per our FAQs, 'let's go shopping' questions aren't allowed. 2) This isn't about Apple hardware or software, it's about some other hardware to use instead.Oh yeah, that's a feature called LNP and basically all companies can take your number and apply it to a new phone of any type within 36 hours, usually it takes much less time. If you are on the same carrier it will be the amount of time it takes to activate your new iPhone 4.None of y files will be deleted o replaced? that's cool but what if i want to completely delete all data as well is there an option?If you want to wipe it from scratch, boot from the DVD and use the Disk Utility to format the drive.You could also just Backup the 3GS and restore it to 4.@vcsjones Bingo.Im no expert about MacPorts, and very likeley it doesent solve your question, but have you ever tried `homebrew`? Its another mananger, but to my opinion its faster, easier and fails much less. Check if `curl` is available for `homebrew`, and if it is, I recomend it much more than MacPorts.Down voted because faB's answer below is indeed correct re GoodReader and this answer is not. I suggest this answer have the "best answer" undone and the questioner consider awarding it to faB's answer.Ditto on the paid Pandora endorsement. I've subscribed to it (and also Rhapsody) for years, and consider them to be excellent investments.Yes - you get access to the App documents without needing to enable app syncing. It's quite powerful to choose to sync apps from one mac, info from another, music from a third. Each "silo" of information remembers which iTunes library syncs it's data. PhoneView is there for the obvious Apple apps that don't allow explicit iTunes document management. It also lets you manually manage music without linking music through iTunes.Agreed, GoodReader is a real solution.I am closing this because it is speculation about unreleased software. See [this meta post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/399/how-to-handle-lion-questions/400#400).thanks for the detailed answer !!Note that you **can** cut a SIM down to a micro-sim, if for some reason you really want to keep the same physical SIM card between phones.+1 Yeah! Camera+ is exactly what I needed. Although Instagram can also save to photo library, but it also uploads on instagram servers (doesn't bode well when there is no signal in metro trains)Well, that gets you WINE. But I mean stuff like Wineskin and WineBottler. Tools that make WINE operation and configuration easier.In terms of most effective and pain free - vanilla wine is the best and most up-to-date way.  WineBottler in particular seems pretty inactive.  Check out the Wine FAQ http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ   There isn't much configuration required, simply start an app with wine /path/to/app.exeCool Thanks for the heads up.Thanks for info, I'll have a look.Agreed with RobZolkos, VirtualBox is one of the best free application available.actually, by 2 miles =)Say what ??? A clean install also known as "Erase and Install" will wipe the whole system, including your personal files - but an "Archive and Install" will save your personal files, and only re-install the OS X system. Read about the options here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1545There is a bookmarks bar like on the Mac in newer versions of iOS for iPad, so that would be one tap.@waiwai933 good point :)[Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) of course! But you'll need a lot of trickery to get it if you're not in a supporting country (and that's why I'm not adding it as an answer).As a developer I completely ignore those sites: from what I've seen they rarely have more than a handful of visitors and site quality tends to be quite poor. Based on the fact that a review on a well-respected site isn't likely to sell many copies, paying for reviews is insane. One app of mine got a 4.5 (out of 5) mice review on MacWorld -- not the hottest review site, but well-respected with a lot of traffic -- and I sold maybe 10 extra copies as a result. Definitely not worth paying for.That's about all there is to its disadvantages: more inconvenient updates & backups and SSH password. I'll elaborate more on this later if I get the chance.How to install this app on my iphone or Windows 7 PC? I don't use MAC.When you try and run an application, does it come up with an error message?it will open the app for 1/10th of a second and then close, no error nothing.I was thinking that. i have logged out and back in the itunes thing. did not make a diff, will try download an app tonight when I'm home.you can define this commands at .bash_profile to be able to use them at all timesI have never had Xcode update through Software Update even on a fresh install (ie, brand new machine, install xcode, know there are updates, and still no update).I personally have a dev account, so I have to download each time. I have heard that some people (with 3.x Xcode) did have it update before...but I have never had it happen. Also, with 4.x, even through the App Store you download the whole thing again versus just an update I have heard.So you want an application on your iPhone that shows the location of your friends iPhone?  Without them knowing?when I had Xcode 3, I can confirm that I could sometimes update through Apple's update. But I don't think the update is available right away through there. There might be a few weeks delay.@robzolkos - Yes@Loic Interesting. Perhaps I and those I know have always updated manually before Software Update got around to it.That does discourage me, yes. :-) However, it is the best we have seen, and it is probably the definitive answer, unfortunately.That's probably it. I wasn't an heavy Xcode user, so I didn't take that much interest in Xcode releases.Thanks, I did the upgrade, seems to work just fine !@Rene read the title of your article. **It doesn't cover Snow Leopard (10.6).** *There is no erase and install option in Snow Leopard*FYI...I wanted to use BetterTouchTool to use keyboard gestures to switch between my spaces. I have a Windows 7 VM running in Parallels and wanted an easy way to switch between my Mac and Windows. When I ran BTT for the first time, it gave me a message that there are conflicts with Parallels that cause keystroke losses and the developer hasn't been able to solve for this. MagicPrefs works great though.AFAIK Viber does not interface with Google Talk or Google Voice.The application is developed in Objective-C and is then design to natively run on Mac. However, as the source code has been open-sourced, it may well be that the project will be ported to Windows in a near future.I am converting this to a Community Wiki because it is impossible for this to have one 'correct' answer.@Nathan: Good idea - Thanks!correct. Just wait a bit longer, so its not treated as a quadruple.As awesome as Lingon is - it doesn't change the way launchd works. This doesn't help with the problem that launchd isn't set up to both start and then stop an app. iCal doesn't have an easy way to know it's supposed to kill itself, so the issue is tracking the PID of the iCal process so it can be unloaded/quit once the processing is done. See my answer for more details.@koiyu: I recommended trying it out,as you can always download a free trial to see if its something worth pursuing.  I put very little hope into MS products for OSX, but that's just me. Also, he is using it for a church iMac, so maybe it would be something easier to learn..I'm sure they're not using it for the advanced features MS word has to offer..just another option.  I've never heard anyone not liking iWork.did that answer your question?I just wanted to say: "Reset to Factory Settings" doesn't really apply to computers, at least not Apple computers (including iPhone/iPad). The concept of resetting to factory settings is only for small(er) devices like the AirPort series, and of course non-computer devices entirely like Tiger handheld gaming systems and a bunch of other cheap stuff. You can load a completely fresh OS, but that's not exactly "Factory Settings".I'll add a comment - What I do love to do in this case is to buy an external drive and install the new OS on the external drive. I'll boot to that drive leaving my important data on my internal drive and migrate that data to the "new" OS to play with for a day. I'm very careful to not do anything on the "new" OS that I can't export or save back to the old system. You can run for weeks like this to learn. Then erase the "new" and try again with the migrate when a bug arises. You're always a reboot away from your stable system with it's data safe and sound.One word to this answer: yep. +1Just because I'm curious. Are you saying you don't have a computer of your own? Why can't you run iTunes and use your own computer to sync your iPad?What Nathan is suggesting is that the Ambient Light Sensor has dropped the brightness down below the set value. When you press a brightness setting button, it is reset to the statically defined value, which is perhaps brighter than what the sensor dimmed it to. So it gets brighter to the last setting, then dimmer as you press it.I also figure you could have two launchd plists - one to call the **launchctl load** and another delayed to call the **launchctl unload** but I prefer the script solution since it behaves better if the mac is sleeping and wakes after the launch time has passed. Launchd will trigger events that should have run during the sleep time and you might get the load and unload quicker than you desire in that odd case.For what? A little more explanation of how this is a tip or stick might make this a better tipWorks again thanks :)I don't have a computer with windows or a mac Pc. Just 3 running ubuntu :) iTunes in wine is crap, with no USB support.You should *really* accept some answers.I'm going to answer this in general since there is good information about that specific model even while avoiding the off topic area of asking questions for a specific recommendation of a vendor. With a little general knowledge, you'll quickly find local shops that do repairs but I'll not call anyone out.I was going to mention http://support.apple.com/kb/TA47742?viewlocale=en_US for how to backup iTunes library, it even has a poor mans incremental backup, but supposedly some things don't come across in the official iTunes backup. Also, http://www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/cobianbackup.htm for a recommended backup software, but I have no idea how to set it up, and I think the iTunes Add To Library timestamps would be off.Using CrashPlan or some other smart software to incrementally back up the two folders needed is the only perfect solution for capturing everything iTunes stores - even going forward as new things get added. This has always worked. http://www.crashplan.com/Yeah, I thought Linux was the likely answer. How about Windows or OSX in VirtualBox?Mac:
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/
Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
Windows Vista & 7:
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\ for the iPhone backup filesAlso http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1751 to backup the entire library to an external, but again no incremental backup or iPhone backupsCrashplan is a paid offsite storage like mozy though, correct?So is drinking bleach :)I don't know about the others, but LaunchBar can be set to run as a background service. Open LaunchBar's preferences, click the Advanced tab and the press the 'Hide Dock Icon...' button at the bottom of the screen. It'll restart LaunchBar and it won't be in the dock any more.@hobs: CrashPlan is free if you want to use it to backup to another machine or drive on your home LAN. It only costs money if you want to also back up to their cloud storage.It is not impossible to link the in a Terminal and it would not screw anything upHobs - you are awesome!thanks for the info bmikeI like it when we work together+1 - The application itself has to make a call to the system to say not to draw a dock icon. It's pretty easy and you can request it for the apps that don't support it. It's not super hard, and is a level of fit and polish most purveyors of software will agree is worth the effort to code.So http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12571/is-it-possible-to-run-10-6-and-10-7-side-by-side-and-share-a-user-profile/12578#12578 is wrong then? Also drinking bleach is possible, just not recommended.Be aware if you modify the sim and it messes up the iPhone(doubtful) they will probably claim it is your fault and void your warranty.Is there any particular focus for this office? ARD is pretty sweet for installing apps all at once or reporting on hardware across the office, something like a mac mini server would be nice for collab/groupware stuff, though you could set it up on the linux server side, usage of bonjour enabled tools aka ichat for quick file sharing, and various other things. If it is all standardization of resources or compliance there are also remote management softwares out there to check for file system changes and the like, but I forget off the top of my head@hobs thanks for the comment. It's a paper-pushing office, with basic needs: file sharing and contact sharing. MS Office will probably be used for document creation, and virtualisation (VM Ware or Parallels) to run e.g. Wordperfect and other legacy apps. (Speaking of legacy: We still have, and use, a typewriter ...)I've tried osx 10.7 in virtual box on a x86 but that failed. should try on my x64 some time. not interested in windows much, would rather buy a macbook air if I have to.launchd is built to start things on demand, once, or continuously. It's not set up to stop things except for log out or shut down. Since iCal doesn't have an internal mechanism to listen for a kill command, it's best to load and unload a job that is set to run always. See my answer for more info...I really don't think so. Like I said, simple deduction will lead one to the conclusion that this is not a problem with the battery.Confirm that its a G3 PowerMac? http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g3/stats/powermac_g3_233_mt.html@Josh What "simple deduction" are you doing? You said `"One thing that I have noticed is that my computer now stays on for a few seconds after removing the power cord, then goes to sleep; when I attach the power cord, I can wake it up again and it hasn't been powered down."` When that happens, it's the power management seeing a low charge on the battery and going to sleep to avoid shutting down. Your battery, in effect, has a few seconds of battery life. That's the very definition of a bad battery. The fact that you can't apply the update is merely icing on the cake. You got a shitty battery.@RobZolkos - No, it's not. It's a blue "Smurf".Turn airport off.  Open up console and select "all messages" on the left-hand side.  Turn Airport back on.  Wait for the airport messages to show up.  Paste them here so we can have a look.  :-)If you already have it for guests, then it can be setup to check MAC addresses of the client.spot on, thankyou.  
It took a few moments to get an IP after connecting with wifi, but got there in the end.  
169.254.*.*your right but this is recommended, and no he's not wrong im offering more than one solution considering you havnt offered any?Fair point, but we really don't want to rely upon mac addresses and want to have an encrypted network so that whole angle is out. LDAP might be a solution though . . .Thanks, I'll look into that. Can't just use mac addresses for a few reasons, mainly we like some transport layer security on wireless.What? You can **absolutely** still use the apple app store after jailbreaking.WOW. I didn't even realize Grab was actually still relevant. I remember using it until I learned of the Keyboard Shortcuts, but to think that it's preference still drives the entire built-in facility? Wow! +1 (and much more if I could!). P.S. You should seriously post that to the [Tips and Tricks](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks) question. Totally worth it.Thanks for pointing it out, it looks like it has promise. I'm downloading the trial now!But the code signing breaks and many of the apps don't work. Instapaper is just one example of many. apple hasn't clamped down but it is a risk that should be mentioned.Glad I could help.  :-)My guess.. overheating, logic board, or power supply fail.Is this always the same network?  It could legitimately be that the internet connection is dropping off, rather than your Mac being at-fault.Thanks for the link to the direct download. I tried to apply the patch, and installation was successful, but it doesn't appear to "finalize" it upon startup. Under 'Software Update', the patch is still there. :/The new battery is acting the same way my original (Apple-issued) battery acted. The fact that it now goes to sleep instead of shuts off completely is a good sign (IMO). I would deduce from all of this that my computer is unable to charge the battery.Have a look at this http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2368

Seems that even though the update is successful, it doesn't update the SMC firmware.  Looks like there is a file in /Application/Utilities.Thanks for the link; I'm actually starting to think it has to do with the fact that I have a dual-boot of Ubuntu on my machine. If you take a look at this page: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2434 you'll see that only GUID-partitioned drives can install firmware updates. Mine is Master Boot Record.ok, cool - sounds like you have the answer :)  I'd go with option one in that linked article and create a boot drive to install the smc firmware.This doesn't seem to happen if I browse to facebook from the URL bar.  It seems to happen when I click on the saved link on my home screen.  I find this behavior annoying.  Any way to disable?No, its programmed into the mobile version of facebook.  Any reason you don't use the Facebook app?iPod touches only support the 2.4 Ghz band for 802.11n, so it will probably be on the same frequency.@Nathan My bad - but still a "Clean Install" is normally the same as a "Erase and Install", and therefore I wrote what I did, mainly because you wrote that the personal files would be saved/not affected.Will probably also depend on the number of spaces in your document. Is it a "normal text document" or some kind of "data document". I tend to believe it's the second one due to the uncommon need.@LudoMC yeah exatly, plenty of white spaces (each word is followed by one and the file is 46MB, I'm on intel duo dual core and it is still running after 20 minutes.Pretty bizare, git documentation suggests that installing this version is advantageous, but this version is dated 2005.thanks for the command line, but it doesn't work. Are you sure blank is replacing white spaces ? What I get is a file which is exactly the same of the original oneI need to replace word1 word2 with word1,word2 for exampleI edited the answer.  Put a space in-between the first two / slashes. Let me know how that goes.perfect thanksThanks, I used `echo 'export PATH=/mypath:$PATH' >> ~/.profile`You can fix the code signing issues *very* easily, just patch installd.Frankly, I've **Never** had an app not work, and I have a LOT of apps on my iPad (200+). (Well, except a few cydia apps that aren't updated for the iPad, even now)But of course, unless you need to do this a lot, the speedup hardly matters.Nice.  Didn't think of tr.  Just did an experiment.  sed took 0.002 seconds and tr took 0.333 seconds on the same source file.  Both solutions would significantly beat using TextMate though ;)If you happen to screw something up, see also: [Reset your PATH variable](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/11745/1453)Ok, thanks! but the biggest problem was how to add the path. But I found `echo 'export PATH=/mypath:$PATH' >> ~/.profile`@Jonas: I realized that your problem was solved. My answer was intended for the benefit of future readers, so they can see all the options available to them.The command returns the error "Illegal process ID."yes, it will when the Sync command is not running.  Did you try running the command whilst it was syncing?Looking for [apple-touch-icon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Device_support) would probably yield better results as apple-touch-icon is usually 57x57 (or 129x129) and favicon is 16x16 in size. Favicon is definitely more common, though.If you don't want the file to open in the default application you can re-direct it to the application of your choice with the -a <appname> flag.@RobZolkos: You may wish to try a bigger source file in order to get a meaningful measurement. On a 236 MB file, tr takes 12 seconds while sed needs 30 seconds to get the job done on my machine. If I change from my usual UTF-8 locale to a C locale, the times drop to 10 and 15 seconds respectively.I tried it when the synchronization was running, but in two different Macs I got the following error message: "-bash: kill: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DotMacSyncManager.framework/Versions/A/Resources/mobilemesyncclient: arguments must be process or job IDs".I tried "killall ?9 mobilemesyncclient," and it worked.Yeah, @Harald - good point.  I was testing on a relatively small file ;)ah cool.  Glad you figured it out ;)Thanks, didn't realize the connection between the Dock and the cmd-tab switcher.  I've found that LaunchBar (as Ian C. mentions above) and Tags support this.  Wish Mail, iCal, Evernote and Skype would as I have them open all day, every day and switch to them using only my LaunchBar shortcut.Did you change the size when the VM was powered off or just suspended?@Mark powered offUnder Snow Leopard, this disabled the screen-shot sound only in Grab.  It had no effect on the built-in screen-shot (Cmd-Shift-4).Could you please [summarize the contents of the link](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/485/1453 "Are answers that just contain a link acceptable?")? Also, are you able to confirm that the KB-article is relevant to VMware **Fusion**? The article points only to VMware ESX and ESXi products.no.. i meant the charger, not the USB connectorah I see.  I amended answer.@Josh Did your original Apple battery act like this from the start, when you got the computer, or is this a recent development? It could indeed be the computer, but the likelihood of it being the battery (even two separate batteries) is very high, especially when buying things from eBay. My solution for you is to return the battery and get a new one. If three or four batteries behave the same way, it's probably the computer.Anyway to have a date stamp with iphone?what is the best way to use this script?@koiyu It is the same procedure with VMware FusionQualification: it'll need to be upgraded to 1GB of RAM for Snow Leopard (that model shipped with only 512MB by default).Thank you all it works.thanks for the answer. But I am curious, why is holding the esc button for a few seconds displays all the commands (all 1979 of them:), isn't it an odd way to show them?Its a form of autocompletion.  Similar to if you press any letter and then hold esc it will show you all the command starting with that letter.  You can also type apropos .*  and it will give you a nice list ;)Clearing the NVRAM appears to have at least coincided with this issue fixing itself, if not being the solution itself. If it starts happening again I'll try that.Is there any other way? I've installed AppBackup but it crashes right after splash screen :(to be honest appbackup is just a method of going through the filesystem and grabbing specific files and then putting them back in their places, so let me do some more research, there are definitely other optionsI love the google search term "better than x" http://www.pragmatixconsulting.com/iphoneApps/User_Guide.html and a guide to go with it since it is paid http://www.theiphoneguru.net/2010/11/22/guru-guide-back-up-and-restore-jailbreak-apps-for-ios-4-2/I have figured it out.
http://tshawkins.blogspot.com/2008/03/groovy-on-leopard.htmlI do not think that space cause a problem. SW Developments is written as either SW\ Developments or "SW Developments".thanks for that, will write about my results"Finally, Apple is no longer signing for 4.1, so unless you already backed up SHSH blobs somehow, you will not be able to downgrade". Is this true also if the baseband remains 05.14.02 or only when it is updating to 06.15?Thanks! Appreciate that.@Philip Regan: Linked question is about Antivirus, I was looking for product that can protect my mac against malware and trojan horses. Till my knowledge is there, Clamxav does not protect/detect malware or trojanAnti-virus typically includes coverage for trojans, at least. Malware is a different issue entirely. But I will reopen this.Check for downloads makes sure you had a chance to completely download purchases to your computer. Not to re-download them after they made it to the computer. Say you bought an album on an iPod touch and never synced it and lost it. Check for download will grab those songs in that case to protect you from that limited loss. Once you sync - the store knows it was on the computer and it can no longer be re-downloaded.Thanks for posting the image - it reminded me of an article I saw many years ago. See my edited answer.@RobZolkos I did, thanks to you.Link aggregation is very nice for speed and downtime considerations when a server needs to run fast and without interruption.I really appreciate the advice from @fake-name since it shows that perhaps the majority of apps work and the disadvantage of jailbreaking can be mitigated by applying further patches and user action. It's good to know more about each disadvantage so the answer can be more complete.This reads .mobi files not .epubBah, I forgot that I had to convert them using Calibre.That's not a Mac Pro, it's a PowerMac G3.@ShermPendley Oh, ok, my mistake.Dupe: http://superuser.com/questions/178424/snow-leopard-hide-scrollbar-in-terminalKeep me updated!Great list. It's just too bad that Adobe Digital Editions is so horrid.I suggest you follow http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks/401#401I didn't know apropos had wildcarding/regex. Awesome.Instead of holding Esc, you can just press it, or Tab, twice.Yeah, considering adobe *should* be peerless for digital media, and yet reader and DE are garbage.So whether I access Facebook via a saved bookmark on my home screen or via typing in the URL, aren't I accessing the mobile version of Facebook?  If so, why the different behavior?  I like using the web version of most sites, less switching between apps.  I do use the FB app occasionally when I want to post photos but I mostly use the mobile web site.@Jitendra Vyas Added a link to a tool for Windows.Does Latitude give the possibility to get an history of movement for a given person?Be aware that an encrypted backup stops this vectorAfter much struggle, booted into safe mode, backed up what I needed and reinstalled.Tried Onyx, but not even that helped.  was able to back up.Uh, no.  I have a Core i7 MBP and have the 32-bit kernel enabled since my employer's VPN software requires it, and arch returns i386 for me.  My processor is 64-bit and i have lots of 64-bit processes running, though, so this seems to only tell you what the kernel type is.I'm not too sure about the voiding warranty part. Plus Cydia does not become the main distribution, it's just an added distribution center and no idea what you mean by "control over what is posted".What David said - this only tells you what kernel is running. Like David, I'm using a 32-bit kernel because I need a kext that requires it, but I can run 64-bit user processes with no problem.Do you mean "Escape"? Because scape is not a word.this is so stupid...i just re-booted and pressed option key..now i can boot. Why is this happening??Thanks Rob!  The bookends is a solution to my issue, I have passed this on to the user. It looks to be as about as an elegant solution as one can get since apple did not design it with docking in mind.I have Xcode installed, but where can I get the unix dev support? Could you give me step by step instructions ?I'd better do it manually, thanks :)@hobs, Paul Lefebvre mentioned PKGBackup, it also was mentioned in your links, but it is a bit unsuitable for me. As I see, there is no free tool except AppBackup which doesn't work at my phone. Nevertheless, thanks for your advices!You should only learn to install software from reliable sources and you will not need any antivirus. There is no antivirus on the market that can fully protect you, and it will never be.Thanks for that, it makes sense appreciate your help.It's not critical it seems Cinexplayer will play movies out through the hdmi. It's a pity as don't have access to a pc to transfer the movies from vlc to cine player. Went away for Easter thinking I could use the big tv..... wish there was a filemanager utility that you could use to move files around on the iPad, without a pc.If you change the country, your automatically payment need to change too (US = US creditcard, PayPal) - unless you're using Gift CardsOK, but what about pulling down an arbitrary menu like you can on Windows?  It sounds like OSX requires a lot more keystrokes to do the same thing, especially if my application has a lot of menus with a lot of items that don't have dedicated key bindings.Hi styfle.First of all, thank you for answering the question. Just to reiterate;
1. Yes, I am running a weblogic server on my windows machine and access it via http://windows-pc-name on that same machine.
2. Actually the weblogic (app server) requires VPN connection (though I  am not very sure, but think it is coz of some database which is only accessible via VPN)..I cannot access the web app on my Windows PC browser if I am not connected to the VPN  (i.e. the app server does not work)
Now I want to somehow access the same web app on my iPad.i.e.the http://windows-pc-name I access on WindowsThe main issue is..since the Windows machine is on VPN, the iPad cannot access it (even though they are on the same LAN and indirectly connected via the same router)..I mean the iPad connects to the internet via a shared connection on a same local MAC.I have not used weblogic before but can you configure it to use the VPN without configuring your whole machine to use VPN?Have you tried to connect your iPad/Mac to the same VPN ?? - it should then be on the same network.Another solution could be to find your public IP-adr. of the Windows PC. You can try to get the IP-adr. with this page: http://www.myipaddress.com/ - then try to see if you can get a connection from your iPad by using the found IP-adr.Yes, sorry, I mean escape.ok..First I am not sure how exactly can I configure Weblogic ONLY to use the VPN and not the whole machine.

While I know connecting the iPad to the VPN might work, I am trying to avoid that as there seems to be a huge licensing fee to pay for that..

Also I'll have to try out the public ip thing..But let's say I can access my Windows m/c somehow using that..But can that actually mean that the web app can also be accessed via iPad Safari?We could also do some research on what folders it backs up, or even use ssh and rsync to backup 100% of everything, but putting it back would be expected to be non-trivial.http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6490/capturadepantalla201004pd.png When installing xcode there should be a checkbox, just run through the installer again. The next part is installing either macports or homebrew https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew http://www.macports.org/install.php either of these package managers will allow you to download wget with ease once their are installed.That's wrong. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1296 Says all PIM info is sent two ways.Yeah, you're probably right - I just copied the content from the link. My own setup is through Google (Exchange), so I have all in sync over the air with Push on my iPhone, and normal refresh in my local client.This looks like it's our ticket, thanks Rene.There is... if you jailbreak, check out iFile.An interesting test would be to measure a full battery cycle with and without GeekTool. I have a Mac Pro 2008 and tho I have 8 cores, I sometimes see certain CPU activity coming from GeekTool, I had a log monitor among other things, but nothing fancy. But then again, I don't have battery to measure :SIn fact, if you crashed or killed Firefox, removing partial downloads would be abnormal, because it would neglect the possibility of *resuming* it, which on a large file can be a pain if not available. Now when you explicitly cancel it, then that's another story and it would be removed (or at least it should ask).Will it continue to be unloaded after restarting my Mac?Yeah the google exchange stuff does work perfectly, just the 2 way syncing stuff.First sentence alone deserves the +1!just changing the store to US does not work. When you actually try to make a purchase you're taken back to the store relevant to the address/country that you've registered with. This is from first-hand experience. So no, you cannot make purchases on the US store with a non-US credit card. Except using the gift-card trick detailed above.It's possible to do the rewrapping with FFMPeg for much less as well: [http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2010/11/ffmpeg-rewrap](http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2010/11/ffmpeg-rewrap)

I recommend using [MPEG Streamclip](http://www.squared5.com) for the de-interlacing and conversion, much better than FCP.Perfect! Thank you. Just for idiots like me looking for this, you need to do this command: sudo scala_select -f scala28@chealion The FFMpeg rewrapping is so cool! thanx :)@Rene Larsen: So far your responses seem to be moving towards a workable solution. Thx. Please suggest something based on the comments above..nothing in CrashReporter logs.  But in install.log - Begin script: usbmuxdpost then ./postinstall: launchctl: Couldn't start ("//System/Library/LaunchAgenst/com.apple.MDCrashReportd.plist"): No such file or directoryI don't think that you "just like that" can configure WebLogic to use the VPN - with only one net card. If this should work, you need minimum two net cards, so you can configure WebLogic on one using the VPN, and then use the other net card for "local" traffic (wired and wireless net cards could be a solution ??).This is a dupe question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11163/how-do-i-combine-two-or-more-images-to-get-a-single-pdf-file/11169#11169Unloading a launchctl plist persists across restart, so I believe so. That said, I hardly ever reboot, so haven't tested it yet!Fellow f.lux user here. Great app. Best I know w/o 3rd party software or using the monitor's buttons would be to go System Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate. Use "Expert Mode". However this will only let you take it down to 4500 K. Interested to find out the answer on this one.Great info, thanks. I hadn't had the guts to go through all the steps just for the white point. Sadly, though, the lowest kelvin is 4500-4700 (just closed the window ><). Is there a way to adjust *just* the white point? (well, I could calibrate different profiles) And how to adjust it below the Calibrator's options?I found the value hardcoded in /Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ColorSyncCalibrator.plist, but editing it to a lower value had no effect. I will keep looking.It did have an affect when I logged in and out, I was able to black out my entire monitor, so probably relauching something will reset the valueHi, my OSX version is 10.6.6. I am able to open the script and resaved it. It works again now. Many thanks.@I-M-JM Added a new suggestion after I saw it on the Mac App StoreI find the interface too flashy (ugly to be honest! :) But if it fulfills your needs and you have everything you need, then it's the right one!@bmike But `osascript -e 'tell application "iCal" to quit'` does work. `launchd` might not be designed for stopping tasks, but you don't explain why this won't work. Also, in this case, `launchd` isn't stopping a task, it is starting a new one. (That new one happens to be a shell script that stops something, but that seems to be beside the point.).I think I am going to need to ask my own question, something along the lines of what actions are the sys prefs taking after loading that file to tell the mac to activate the change besides changing the file.So far no IP conflicts. One thing I did kill was my VMWare instance. Seems to be a little more responsive after that. Next time it happens I'm going to diagnose it a little more. Might throw some ethereal on the network as well and sniff some packets.actually my mac is fine, I don't need to recover data. I'm just unable to partition itInteresting thread. Matthew makes a error in judgement, the app store is secure from anyone who's money Apple won't take. Right now, pretty secure.  2 bad quarters, Jobs passes away? Not so secure then. What I want from this device is to use it to the max. Like the computer it is, not the phone it pretends to be.  Now, carriers and (RI|MP)AA won't let that happen from apples standpoint.  No way.  I don't see things from apples standpoint however, I see them from mine.  I pay, it's mine. I brick, I pay again. Gotcha. Jailbreaking is the freedom to choose.  That is awesome.I totally agree and missed the most simple solution - killall or osascript. Kudos to @mankoffWhy downvote this?Nope. By my understanding, kudos to @Dori for coding it, and to @geekosaur for pointing out the bug, but I'm not sure why Dori never followed up on this, hence my bounty-ing. Still confused why this answer got voted down 2x.@Bob - this tool should allow you to partition it. If you haven't done so already, take a look at [GParted's homepage](http://gparted.sourceforge.net/). It lists all the various functions it can perform (including partitioning).+1: I had to send an email to support with an Order Number of what I wanted removed.Hmm...that Weblogic config seems to be something very tough to implement..Is there any other way..I mean lets say the Windows machine is completely on VPN and now I want to access from iPad(without the VPN) ?concerning MS OFfice: I don't know about the newest versions (I still have Office:mac 2004), but in former versions the Mac version had some features that the Windows version did not have, BUT it also lacked features of the windows version. As I often used Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate tasks in MS Office, I had problems with the mac version, as there was less support in the programming IDE (no "intellisense" code completion, etc...)concerning MS Office part II:  furthermore, there were always problems with the data format when exchanging files with other versions of MS Office - and especially between the Windows and the mac version.Call me dumb, but do you have to pay the annual $99 fee to be part of the Mac Developer program to get Xcode?+1 for Scrivener, it is something really addictive.As you're able to boot from an external drive, what **I would** do is: move the file to another disk and reboot. If nothing happens (for a few weeks just to be sure) I'd be convinced to delete the file from the other HDD. If something fails I'd boot from the external drive and move the file back. Sadly I have no first-hand experience on this.Indeed, for privacy reasons many people (myself included) prefer not to allow the sending of such return receipts. If I see an incoming message late at night but decide not to answer it until the next day, I don't want the other party to be aware of that decision.You are not dumb at all, unfortunately apple changed around xcode 4 so its either 5 bucks for the package or 99 to be in the dev program. Its annoying because all we want are the OSS headers and stuff. But if you have your original os x dvd you can install xcode right off of there. http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.xcode.htmlThanks - I'll check it out. :)Whats stopping you from trying? You could extract each bash command run it individually (the finds) and see what you come up with, he is just writing their names to files and verifying they exist, which they probably do if you have x11 installed.OK I should have said that what it's looking for doesn't exist, eg. I can't find any libX11.so, I have /usr/X11 path with .dylib libs but I don't know how the differences.According to a couple of places on the web they are equivalent, but maybe not for your purposes, I have no idea. You could try to change .so to .dylib in the find sections and see if that works, *purely hypothetical.*If you had VMware then your VMware network settings might be causing trouble. Either try removing VMware and/or reinstalling it or changing its network preferences. It wouldn't be the first time VMware causes network conflicts (there were quite a few questions about this on this site). Let us know how it goes.I can try that for the X11 libs. For Motif I don't know where to find them.I think you missed the part of his question where he said "without f.lux."oh sorry... I realized it when I just had posted my answerCan you add a short clip of the article to your answer so that we can figure out you're answer based on just this post? Thanks.Forget terminal + visor. iTerm 2 offers visor plus much much more... Switched to few weeks ago, will never go back.I love things but switched to omnifocus for its syncing featuresParallels is much better than vmware. Bought both, only using vmware when I need to share vms with windows users.I agree that iTunes is a ***** and I hate like most people the fact that we have no other choice. But that's still a great syncing tool for music and backuping devices. I doubt any alternatives offer that features for free.Eclipse has always sucked. I used it since first version. There are so much better alternatives. Look at intellij for java, you will regret the time you wasted on eclipse."slowly" is the word. :) look at macvim/vim for a serious all purpose text editor. I left textmate for it a while ago.How do you know this? Because you like Apple products, and nothing you like could be bad?  Answer below describes clearly the danger with this sketch machine of a program. Their own words are the rope they should hang by.Yikes, hold on, Editing, it's auditonThere's been rumors that you can do this with XCode 3 as well, which is free to download if you register as a developer at [developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com) but don't pay. I don't know this for sure, but you could give it a shot first. Saves you $5 maybe :).Wow seems like a major oversite. That's for the delete tip in messages !!Do you want to make Thunderbird look like the iPad's mail app, or the Mac's Mail.app look like the iPad?Yes, I have some experience regarding that, I were just searchin some tool to automatize this process... It seems that I have to do everything manually as I've done somewhen :)Software update?  Sounds like it might be a driver issue.Does this mention of installing open motif work http://mattlong.posterous.com/install-xpdf-on-os-x-106-snow-leopard?@Dave thanks for your reply, unfortunately I can't seem to get this working. I've enabled access for AD and saved your XML as a .plist file in my USER/Library/LaunchAgents folder. Logged out back in, opened TextEdit and let it run for a couple minutes. No comma "," key was pressed. What am I doing wrong?excellent answer! Thanks very much for this. I didn't know about the '*attr' stuff. Is that Spotlight metadata?@Ryan it's possible I might have messed up the plist slightly, but it seems to work for me on my system.  You can also try doing `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/filename.plist` in Terminal to explicitly load it.Is her account a regular account, or a sharing-only account? Also when you do a get-info from her machine on the folder or files in question, what does it say about the level of access she has ("you can only read", etc.)?What if jailbreaking enters the picture?This still shows old and read messages. How do you fix that?@boehj: Thanks. I'm not sure exactly what read/writeattr control, but read/writeextattr control a newish feature which allows arbitrarily-named attributes to be added to a file (e.g. a file downloaded with Safari will have "com.apple.quarantine" and "com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms" xattrs, indicating it came from an untrusted source, and what that source was).  These aren't particularly related to Spotlight, which gets most of its info from looking into the file's contents (as well as some file metadata like name and modify time).@Dave - that did the trick. Thank you! One last question: how can I change it from "Command"+"," to simply "g"? I tried editing the .plist file but nothing seems to change the behavior.How are you charging it?  With the charger that came with it? or plugged into a computer?I want to flip the built-in display.
Also for the external display, you have mentioned about the rotation, but how flipping is possible?A lot of these today, ha. +1Generally I recommend against FTP as it sends your passwords in plain text, is this server local or remote?It's in my office, but I'll be accessing it remotely. What else could I use? I also use AFP (not sure if it's secure or not), but this is not a long term option as other users (Windows) will require access to put/get files on/from the server.Have you considered DropBox? or a similar service to share files with others?  Perhaps you could briefly outline how you intend to use the file server, what sort of files (eg large or small).  If we had this information, someone here could recommend a better product to suit your exact requirements.How about smb with a port opened for you to remotely ssh in and mount the smb shares like http://sharkysoft.com/tutorials/linuxtips/sshsmb/, then the windows clients get authentication and interop, and you get a filesystem like view with security.This is by far the best way to go.  Sure, a bit of pain importing in your old folders, but it is possible.  I'd setup a gmail account first and create all your rules/filters/labels.  Then I'd go into your hotmail, move all your email from the folders back into your inbox and mark them all as unread.  Then let gmail import them all into gmail.  It will do all the filtering/labelling based on your rules.  Once you've done this, configure gmail in Mail.app and your iPhone.  You can even configure gmail to send email with your hotmail email address.   A little pain but a lot of gain.Wow, thanks!  Reading more about chmod +a [here](http://ss64.com/osx/chmod.html), it seems like there's a few attributes you didn't include: delete, writesecurity, chown, append, execute.   Do you know if it would be useful to include any of those in your most excellent command?Well, in that case, Jailbreaking is an entire different world and I'm sure it would be possible to create an app that runs in the background and sets/unsets the orientation to a fixed position by accessing private APIs. What I don't know is if such application currently exists.For a more "iPad-like" interface, check Sparrow: http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/is there a thunderbird skin?As I wrote - if you have two net cards on the machine running Weblogic (e.g. wired and wireless), then you should be able to use one card when connection via VPN, and then the other for LAN access, which your iPad then can connect to.Thanks for the answer. I was trying to avoid macports in favor of brew. I already installed gfortran with brew but apparently there's no brew for openmotif. I'm kind of afraid that this new macports install of X11 will create a big mess. Is macports clean enough to install another X11 ?yes - macports keeps to itself all in /opt  so is clean (as is fink) - homebrew has more chance of creating a mess as it does not separate itself out - however best not to mix them@Reza as I said, you can't change the internal one. You can't flip any display; the closest you can get is rotating.@Ryan when you change the plist, you'll have to "unload" it and "load" it again.thanks for your comment - well, even if the solution is not ready to show, you could explain the approach or idea, IMHO.Well, the problem is that I can't move out of spaces ( neither with a key shortcut or a screen corner ) until the slow animation finishes.  And in my case even dragging one empty space on top of another empty space is as slow as any other case, so, no workaround :(What you're saying is pretty much the opposite of what I read about brew. Why do you say it's not separated ?@Dean Moses: I don't think those would be needed: delete is granted implicitly if the parent folder has delete_child (it should), writesecurity & chown are only needed if you want to be able to change premissions/ownership on each other's files, and append  & execute can only be applied to individual files, not folders (and since we're setting this on a folder...)clarify : You want to record a phone conversation of a conversation you're having with someone in the same room?Phone Conversation. I have edited the questionnice app find :)But I want to record the conversation of both side.nice!  hadn't heard of this one.:) glad to share.I realize that its not super basic, but after seeing it in action, and seeing other devices (e.g. The BlackBerry PlayBook) excelling at multitasking I really miss it on the iPad.  I'm also in an odd case whereby I own an iPad, but not a Mac. Thus going the developer route is actually very expensive (~$2,000 for the MacBook, + $99/yr for the dev program, + $5 for the Xcode/registration) ;-)This could also be an accessibility issue as well, good question. http://support.apple.com/kb/TA26508?viewlocale=en_USHomebrew uses the Apple libraries as much as possible. macports uses itself as much as possible. Both are affected by anything you pit locally into /usr/local - brew even more so as that is what it uses. Now how much of an issue this is I don't know. What is certain is that macports and fink are more separated than homebrew.I have, Disk Utility pops out but doesn't see it.Actually, I've just found out by trying that Unarchiver can do the same (i.e. extract). Hopefully someone will be able to find out how to *mount* them.OK thanks. I'll install macports and install openmotif from it, as I don't (yet) have much installed with brew I hope it will be fine.How to use this? I've installedI'm pretty sure that they eliminated Xcode downloads from the free version of the developer program at the same time as they made it available on the Mac App Store. I certainly heard it from a couple of people who tried it, but I can't easily check as I'm already a paying developer.Answering your question: Right now Mono is mature enough for me to consider writing software that compatible on both platforms. My hobby work is arround framworks and my pro work is all about JavaEE and C# server apps and web pages so my users don't care about the OS as long as they have the web broswer. And in my personal opinion Mono is getting better then .NET on Win but using ubuntu gave me a hard time to install Java, Mono and Db engines like oracle to do my prffesional work without the painful configuration and struggle, will Mac in this case make a difference?LastPass doesn't integrate with the wifi settings. It looks to be what I use 1Password for - storing various web site log in credentials and having a mini browser embedded to automate the entering of that web password. It would be of limited use in storing the password for a web based authentication method for joining wifi but doesn't truly answer your stated question.@Bartosz At my work, we use Oracle servers on everybody's laptop. There are a few Mac users, and they have had no end of trouble running Oracle on Mac. Usually they keep a Windows VM running at all times to run Oracle. (Of course, the Linux users had a helluva time getting Oracle to work there, too.)@Dave How exactly do I do that? Just change your Terminal command (above) from "load" to "unload"?Yes please let me know the command line way.. also can we make shell script like of file on mac (like we do on linux) so I can run it easily. Thanks :)@CajunLuke Thx for the answer, so in your personal opinion are Mac right for me? Most opinions I read on the Web are addressing video editing and graphics which I don't care about also I'm not a fanboy of Win or Mac or Linux (they all suck ;p) so my decision in based aaround the work I do, and also I want to free myself from Win, as from the programmers perspective it limits my point of view. But macs are pricey so my money is at stake here pls help :-) thank yousince you're considering if you need it, yes you need it.Well, it's not key repeat rate, it's the fact that a couple of the keyswitches are flaky and sometimes give multiple key events for a single physical key down. This is before the key repeat kicks in.@hobs, that prompted me to look into the Slow Keys feature in Universal Access. Unfortunately, it seems that it doesn't actually filter out the duplicate key events unless I set the threshold high enough so that normal typing is too fast and keystrokes are lost. Also, with that feature on, key repeat rate becomes incredibly slow.Hmm, that's a good idea. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work: the substitution appears to happen only when the repeated keys are an independent word, and it doesn't address the issue of when the repeated key is mixed with other letters (e.g., "addrerrss", which just happened actually - it's the R key that's bad). Thanks though!@Ryan exactly :)Bartosz - I'm going to flag this as subjective and unanswerable. I'd love you to distill down one question that could be answered and then ask that one question. This is a great question for trolling - but mac programming has nothing to do with your perception of value, whether you can play games on development hardware. There are easily 4 great questions here but they need to be reworded/separated to make them even answerable with an authoritative "this is THE answer to the question asked"I can download Xcode and I have never paid Apple anything regarding development.If you consider buying a mac, in my opinion you should really consider buying a 15' mbp as they have a Radeon chip, as you said you want to play games...I'll +1 this as well. No one will know you are using gmail or IMAP to send/receive hotmail. You don't have to lose that account - just the restrictions in using each message with a server that doesn't sync. When most people realize that the from field still shows hotmail, replies still go to hotmail, and their messages from hotmail get tagged/organized in gmail they make the jump. I don't care if my neighbor drops my mail off at the post office - as long as it doesn't delay my mail and isn't hard to set up or understand - passing POP through IMAP is very feasable to allow true syncing.Could you elaborate / edit the question. Are you storing passwords in the keychain? Did you reset the VNC password assuming you are using normal finder / Apple default screen sharing.Cool. I wonder if the source has any effect on enabling the developer options.@skarface There is no option in the Snow Leopard VPN settings to route only specific traffic over VPN. That is exactly what I was aksing. HOW can I do that with Snow Leopard or with a third party app?Xcode 3 is still free, but Xcode 4 (which I believe you need for this task) is not, unless you're part of the $99/year developer program. Individuals with free memberships can only download Xcode 3 from ADC. They have to get Xcode 4 from the app store for $5.Yes - if you agree to the free dev terms you can get Xcode 3 for this - see answer below for more details...+1 for Camera+. And dont miss that they offer a great analog filter pack.you da bombBaseband version has nothing to do with downgrading. This is solely determined by the iOS version of the device and if Apple is still signing for the version on that hardware. Once they are no longer singing, there's no way to downgrade unless you backed up the SHSH blob.Hi @Niloc, thanks - but see my comment posted earlier. :)Hmm.. I just tried mBox for Mac with the latest Mail.app (v4.5) on SL 10.6.7 a few minutes ago.. It worked for me.. What was failing for you?? But otherwise I feel your pain man.. I also am stuck with Hotmail.. :(Sorry I couldn't be more help :(Damn. I guess its time to get a new keyboard haha.Yep. There is another place your settings for that device are placed iirc, but if I couldnt change a setting I would be looking for a plist to delete or a cache to regenerate. +1Hi bmike, I'm just using whatever the default Apple "share screen" functionality is.  No VNC-specific stuff.  Also, I don't tend to use "remember my password" style functionality, and I don't specifically use the Keychain.  Does that help?  Sorry I didn't add/edit the original question as I don't think there's new info to add.  Hope this helps.@hmthr Try disabling VPN. Just run the web server and host some arbitrary index.html page.

This question should probably be migrated to StackOverflow.I do a lot of web development so this is mainly a FTP for accessing those files. File sharing is a perk (but still necessary). I'm considering CrushFTP?Another vote for Camera+ - the way you can take lots of pictures in quick succession and then later upload them all to the 'camera roll' makes it much more usable than the built-in camera app.There is no error there - what does the log say?@VxJasonxV actually we kinda do, he said: "USB port of my Airport Extreme base" so we can assume he's either using 11g or 11n (unless his iMac is *really old*). What we don't know is what number of files he has (zillions of small files could destroy that Wi-Fi). Yet his speed looks abnormally slow. I bet there's interference in his Wi-Fi.Interesting, I'll get back to you, not the most elegant solution, but could be an alternative given that there doesn't seem to be a solution yet.Hmm.. The  mistake I was making and which took me like 30mins to figure out (and I was getting a very similar error) was that in my Mail.app settings, I had turned on SSL for incoming email. It worked like a charm when I turned it off..Which version of MySQL ?? v5.5.11 doesn't work (can't start) on Snow Leopard, but the old v5.1.56 do work (can start).This sounds like a warranty usage case.@Dori dun think it's a duplicate, but it is closely related.I don't think that the trick of "the fist backup" with the disk plugged directly on the computer will work. It seems that TimeMachine works differently if this is a networkdrive (Over the network, It's a dmg file that is used instead of the real volume) At least, that's my experience with my laptop.I am running OS X Server. I just installed Rumpus and it seems to be doing all that I need and it's quite easy to use (the only downside is the spicy price but they do offer a quite generous trial period so hopefully I'll decide if it's worth the money. It also supports adding secure certificates if I ever need one. Martin, thanks for your answer, I'll definitely be looking into the info you shared because, as I said, Rumpus is quite expensive and I do prefer a service that comes with the OS rather than an extra service. Thanks! :)Correct. The process is authorize computer, connect phone, when prompted, transfer purchases. If you are not prompted before you get the message that says "THIS WILL WIPE YOUR DEVICE", just cancel, right click the iPhone in iTunes under devices, and choose transfer purchases.Check /var/log for mysql related logs and start trudging through them until you see some errors.When it connects do you get an active connection to your internal resources?Excellent, that did the trick. Thank you.Yeah, sounds like old school cmos problems.I wanted to quickly answer "yes sure", checked the additional options and was surprised that there seems to be no option for searching for locked files in the finder. :-( I only found solutions for terminal like that one: http://macosx.com/tech-support/mac/finding-a-locked-file/21936.htmlRestoring as new in a new user could possibly help if it downloads a new ipsw file that isnt jacked, but pretty much it sounds like warranty time is now.In Address Book contacts ???Do you just want to search a contact on your iPhone ? You are aware that if you scroll to the left in Springboard (the "app overview") you'll end up in a search window which among other things, also searches your contacts ?iphone search find only the name and nothing else.Thanks, I  will have a good look at this blog, but I do not think that it will give me the possibility to find a string in "notes" in the address book.Nice thing it [has always been free, so far](http://appshopper.com/productivity/pastefire).I've had the same experience. I'd definitely recommend using Ethernet for that first backup. Also, I've seen better performance on my machine using the 5GHz wifi band on my Time Capsule if you've got it and can't use Ethernet for some reason.Anything in the system log? Open Console in the Utilities directory. Select FILES, system.log in the left pane, and type 'pppd' in the search box.  The right pane will show the log messages for VPN connections.Unfortunately, it looks like this only works on Windows; on the mac, iTunes only gives the option to sync with Safari!Excellent. That helps greatly. The default relies on VNC sharing enabled with a VNC password as well as allowing it for all users or your specific user in sharing preferences. Problems with the user, the network, or the system can break things as you describe. I'll post an answer to list these in more detail.@ericsocial: thanks, forgot to put that in the original question. Yes, the key is enabled in the pref panel, but doesn't work. However if I replace with say... option key or alt, then it does! Initially I thought it was the physical key that was the problem, but now I got a new keyboard and, well is the same issue.I have all my folders avalable on my iPhone, and I haven't done anything to get them there. How is your gmail setup ?? what if you move a mail in gmail to a lable (folder) will it then be placed correct ?? How is your rule(s) in Apple Mail setup ??What do you see when you cmd shift 4 and selected the region?@Kerin - I'm probably being dense but here goes.  :)  Let's say I set the slider at 25% and turn on auto brightness.  At the time I make this setting I do it so the brightness is comfortable at that time.  When I go into a significantly brighter area, not like 12pm on the equator but something more reasonable, the autobrightness setting increases the brightness marginally but not nearly enough to see comfortably.  I think a great brightness configuration would be implemented as follows.  Forget auto-brightness all together.  Then, the user goes into a "dark" situation (cont. -->)(cont.), whatever they consider dark to be.  They set the brightness slider so it's comfortable for them in that scenario.  Then for example they go to the normal office daytime situation and set a brightness for there.  And so on, for their environment.  In reality it's probably <= 5 data points.  Once config is done, the sensor picks up the lighting level at a particular scenario (office, dark, etc) and sets the brightness according to their setting for that scenario.Hmm. Have you thought about trying something like PCKeyboardHack and trying to remap the CAPS key to another key and test to see if the Capitalizing funtionality is still working? This definitely sounds like a pretty odd issue. Have you checked to make sure that Text-to-Speech isn't bound to that key? System Preferences -> SpeechAfter doing a little research, someone was experiencing this problem and reset the System Management Controller and apparently it started working. You can read up on it [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964) that goes a little above my head though. [Here](http://boardreader.com/thread/Snow_Leopard_upgrade_Keyboard_Letters_no_82kjX19xpt.html) is the link to where the idea came from.Alternately, if you decide you don't really need a CAPS Lock key, you could [use it to launch Alfred or something similar by remapping it](http://words.tev.net/?p=463). I did, and it's quite awesome, I mean how often do you really need that CAPS Lock?@hobs when I press cmd+shift+4 it types $ in wireshark search box.One thing to keep in mind that Apple engineers know the product in and out and generally know more about how SSD really work. It is rare when we consumers can get a better price on something that could have been included as a factory option. It's fun to see new product come out and be able to jump on the occasion when something wasn't ready soon enough to ship with the product but shows up later like some of the recent SSD in MacPro and Macbook Pro where real use can get faster than from the factory.hmm, no "racoon" process running.Nope, that didn't help.USB 3 doesn't do anything significant for latency. You want your SSD to be on a fast internal bus like SATA or PCI and not burdened behind something as busy and laggy as USB.there is no desktop when you cmd+tab to wireshark you go to another envirinment (X11) and if you want click desktop must switch to another application then your solution is useless for my case.@koiyu Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm not willing to upgrade for a minor issue like this.I have seen so many LCD panels made worse by attempts to fix a stuck pixel it's not even funny anymore. The transistors that control the pixels are located along the edges of the display and mashing the 11 layers of display in hopes of massaging it into health are generally ineffective and certainly counterproductive to the long term health of your display. Do read up on the technology before attempting to repair your LCD. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4044Not true, resize your wireshark window to have a little smaller and then you can click on the desktop, or use Expose to show the desktop click on it and use Expose to show your application again. I did it and it worked.I don't know how you can do it because when I want run wireshark first it rum X11 (a grey environment) then run wireshark into X11 so when I minimize or resize wireshark I just see X11 Grey environment and can't resize it (or minimize)The iOS backups are fragile and store thousands of pieces of small data in thousands of files with one master file that assembles the tiny bits of data into one whole that iTunes uses to reconstitute the data. Recovery tools are great for getting some data, but the chances of thousands of perfect recovery all in the correct location makes this a very long shot.Is Aqua window manager still running or are you in a non-default X11 mode different than simply firing up the standard X11.app after a normal user log in to OS X?On the download page you can download Wireshark images for OSX which starts X11 automatically and runs almost like a normal application.Nope. In that pane it says Disconnecting... and the connect button is disabled.I think it's something deeper, since it shows that way in the Network systems preference panel.Still can't reconnect if I do that.Bonus: Coda does have an option for SFTP instead of just FTP.Wow, even that didn't work for me. :(Also, 2011 MacBook Pros start in 64-bit mode.Nice try! Nope, that made no difference... it came back still "Disconnecting..."Any exciting log output in `/Applications/Utilities/Console.app`? Click on "All Messages" in the left hand Log List (Click 'Show Log List' if you don't have a left column) and use the filter box in the top right for perhaps either "VPN" or "racoon"?@Joel I assume you've tried rebooting the entire machine? What about removing the VPN and adding it back again?Do you have an ACL on that folder?Don't forget games!I'm not sure I understand. What short name are you talking about, the user's name? You can always change that if that's what you want. I assume that the old Mac works (tho the display is "broken").

How are you going to perform the migration?Lately Google added behavior to the web apps. Now I can accept invitations even when sent to another address (forwarded to Gmail) using the web client. On the iPhone: still no luck.Would you be so kind to describe your setup a little more detailed? Do you connect to Gmail via IMAP or Google Sync? How about your calendar (Google Sync or ICS URL)? Are the invitations sent to your Gmail address or do you forward other mail into your Gmail Inbox? Are those invitations sent by Google Calendar or by Notes / Outlook / Exchange Server?I have IMAP for email and Google Sync for the others. These are invitations from someones elses Google Calendar, unsure on how. However, I do know that as of recent, you are able to accept a meeting for Google Calendar but won't communicate with the original exchange server other than google.  Also, meeting status is not supported in Google Calendar by the iPhone.Doesn't work OMM. It just doesn't move the window onto the main screen... I do have Access for Assistive 
Devices enabled.Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.can you please try flushing your dns cache with this command dscacheutil -flushcache and restarting your browser.   Let us know if you can still access server.local with your browser?I forgot to mention that I had done that. I'll update my question with that and my OS X version.Great question and this happens all the time. You did well to upgrade the new mac to 10.6. See my answer - I would make test accounts all the time to update all the software and get things just right then delete the "test" user to allow the recipient to get that clean new mac feeling without having to update all the apps the first thing they did. (and also to make migration not regress data to older versions of iLife data files, etc...)This did not help, sorryCan you confirm that the monitor still works with another computer?I have tried with a completely different monitor and cable that I am sure is working.ok cool.  Check my edited answer re resetting the smc.  See if that works.Looks like a DNS problem to me. try `host server.local`. If you cannot resolve it, add `server.local` to your `/etc/hosts`.I am certain that rebooting will fix it, so I'm actually NOT rebooting so that I can try every suggestion that comes up here, in hopes of finding a solution for this, you know, for the Internetthis looks promising, it is a PPTP vpn. I will try it tomorrow when I get back to that machine.But why would the browser on the Mac go to server.local but not in terminal.  Thats the bit I don't get.Well, still having the issues sporadically. I've killed my VMWare instances and still had the issues somewhat. But again, VMWare works flawlessly at my office on our LAN so not sure why it would hose my home connection. Will keep this thread updated...@RobZolkos That I don't know.@Rob- Thanks, it worked. I had already created an account but selecting None in the card type helped in the verification too. :)That seems to work! You're lifesaver, thx a bunch :)@bmike I don't know what you mean by Aqua windows manager, if you mean the X111 grey windows, yes it runs and wireshark run within it.Thanks, but I'm not willing to drop Chrome :DIrrefragable answer, thank you!THX. At least it should open the text file i pointed at.Could you please dump contents from `/usr/local/mysql/data/unknown-e0-f8-47-0c-04-a0.lan.err`? Looks like an error related to ethernet address binding, I guess.Looks like you even have the same keyboard as me. I'll give it a try.I updated my answer to allow you to open a text file pointed at the script with vim.A very nice keyboard. I have the non-illuminated version, but it's very nice. The M1-M5 keys do not work (the software is for Windows). I use "ALT" as Command and the "win" key is my "option", kust like the Mac keyboard.@hobs : yes, I have an active connection.But a fix can found here: http://langui.sh/2011/03/21/fixing-growlmail-in-10-6-7-mail-4-5/@Rene @LudoMC Didn't know about the patch.... that's useful to know!I am a Mac User since Tiger and a casual blogger as well. I have Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro right now, and reason for having Windows is 1 software, it's call'ed Windows Live Writer. It's awesome if you are blogging. If Microsoft ports Windows Live Writer to Mac OS X in future, I'll remove Windows at that moment only ;)@Rohit plus you really should try the apple support. You might get the replacement.Good enough poor man solution. I like it.yet for another app that should be just a built in feature...Also worth noting that Flock development has just been [discontinued](http://www.macworld.com/article/159186/2011/04/flock_discontinued.html), as of yesterday.If you're seeing "a grey environment" whenever X11 starts up, then X11.app is running in full screen mode. Press Cmd-Opt-A to toggle that, then you should see Wireshark running as a regular window on your desktop, and the other screen grabbing suggestions here should work fine.This didn't work either.I'll add a note about dropbox. No one is disputing that they encrypt the files, but some were confused between the policy that DropBox employees were prohibited from accessing files (by retrieving the key they store for YOUR files and applying it to your files) and the fact that they can and will do that when asked by lawyers or the government. DropBox is as reasonably secure as anything humans design and control.+1 for 1Password (more like +8 as it's really awesome even as a stand alone product) - it is so much faster more refined for password storage than Keychain. They also work well with dropbox so if you're OK with their security policy (which is about what you'll get from most consumer sites that try to protect/encrypt your data) the time + money for the mac software alone might be cheaper than another backup solution assuming you don't need to back anything else up offsite.Your ISP, any hosting service, and any software vendor that has income is capable and willing to provide "authorized" agency with your data - often without notifying you. We only get to choose what country we store our data and what country we store our property. I do not disagree with your premise but maintain that Dropbox isn't any worse or better than the other options. Even PirateBay has compromised user IP/email and trivial to hack MD5 hash of passwords. Going online makes you far more insecure and there is no way around that.Yes, it was working fine until I implemented two step. Where is the keychain app on my iPhone?I totally love launchd - it's so awesome to not have to hack/grok fseventsd but have a tidy and powerful wrapper to kick off scripts.Sorry, misread, thought you were on a mail.app on a mac.  My bad.  OK, try this, get a new application specific password on your iphone in safari, quickly copy and paste it into the password field in mail.app.   I believe the password is only valid for an extremely short amount of time.  Let me know if that works.Nothing unusual there (I took a screenshot of the console log)Nope. pppd was not running.From this Google support page : http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=1056283&topic=1056287

"Google Authenticator cannot generate application-specific passwords. Google Authenticator only generates verification codes, which are used to sign in to Google through a web browser."

I don't think this will help with mail.appIt only authenticates the devices, not the program.Still didn't work.@RobZolkos: The passwords are valid until they are manually revoked.@gawity - my understanding is that until they are actually being used they remain valid for a short amount of time.  Once actively being used, you are right, they remain valid until revoked.I just saw that.  I'm trying it now and will report back.It's probably worth adding that when mapping, the PC keyboard's Windows key will be represented as the Command key in the list of physical keys shown above, and the Alt key will show up as the Option key.Didn't work.  This is the page I saw http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3044@RobZolkos If you read what is written in the link you'll need to go to "2-step verification settings page", where you then after step #3 will read this: "Afterwards, you'll need to create application-specific passwords. Learn more"ok, last thing I can suggest is creating a new smart playlist and point it at the smart playlist that isn't syncing correctly.  So just create one and in the settings put "playlist is <name of original smart playlist>"  Then sync only this playlist.  Let me know if that works.The answers would be less of a "beauty contest" and have more usefulness if the answers added **Rule 5. Please explain why this game is great in one or more sentences.** (replay value, good for brief amusement but never gets old, challenging puzzles)That's not true. It was updated a few months ago to allow this.Following all the steps from the page I linked, setting up a new playlist with the same settings and rebooting finally did it.  Thanks for your suggestions.@boehj: You are right, I haven't faced a similar issue after 10.6.7 update. @Ancide: Please update your system using Update Combo.Yep, I would also recommend the combo. +1Don't overlook the `options` button - it's best to choose Master Boot Record as the partition format for maximum backwards compatibility. Most are already set that way but I've seen some that needed this to work well with a FAT volume.Sounds very promising! :) Thanks a lotNo worries, I hope it works. :)It turned out to the the adapter cable, I purchased another one today and plugged it in and everything was fine. Strange the cable seemed to be more resilient.Is there a way to get into the directory as on a flash drive and just put the app file in there?What happens when you plug the hissy headphones into anything else? Also, do the hissy headphones have three or four sections of contact on the plug?You should rephrase your answer so that it looks like a real answer to the original question and not a reply to @Mikey's answer (even if you mention it). Anyways, thanks for the link !I think it's easier to ask them how many rings their plug has.There are three connectors on the headphones plug.Also, if i plug them into anything else they are fineI'm sorry, two connectors on the headphonesGlad to hear you fixed it. They look resilient but they are not :SOkay, too bad.. was just wondering@Rene: Mysql 5.5.11 (64 bit version) running here on Leopard (binary downloaded from mysql site) quite happily.@nimrodm Yeah, it should work on Leopard, but not on Snow Leopard.I'm looking for the location of those credentials on my mac and a basic understanding of the trust chain that iTunes uses to convince iOS to talk when it's in a locked state. :-) I'll edit my question to make this more obvious. Thanks!You don't need a hub or switch or the like. The Ethernet ports will turn regular Ethernet cable into 'cross-over' cable as needed.how would i do it using a wireless connectioni already said i dont have a firewire cable. If the only way to do this is with a firewire or external hard drive i can do that by myself, but i was hoping i could go ahead and do it without those thingsI think this is very close to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7984/change-terminal-apps-default-shell-to-bash.Congratulations on the new mac!I'm talking about [Ethernet cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable), not FireWire. Ethernet will be much quicker for this task. But you may not have Ethernet cable either.Select your iTunes folder in Finder, Get Info and check the "Shared Folder" box. Your mac will share it or guide you to the preference pane to turn on file sharing.  The new mac should see it in the finder side bar or Go -> Connect to server... in finder@boehj: Look at that. You learn something new every day. I didn't realize this. I'm relatively new to Mac myself. Thanks!Yeh, it comes in very very handy. Use it all the time.perfect!  what about jumping around by word?  (ctrl-left and ctrl-right in windows)@at01 I updated my answer.Another very handy one is Ctrl+l to clear the screen.Who designed the keys for Terminal?!?!wow, thanks!  I already credited the answer, but this is greatoh duh, thank you for stating out the obvious i apparently over looked :PNo problemo, I had fun just making the list work with the site.This sounds a bit simpler than the clean-up option suggested so will give it a try - thanks.hmm, ok, I can run it in the background by appending `> /dev/null 2>&1 &`.  I guess it's not asking me for a password because I've been playing with sudo... my concern is running something in the background with `&` will have issues when prompting me for a password with sudo..Thanks for the information - am going to try the other suggested option but will try this if that one fails.ok well i do have an ethernet cable... so let me try thatI get this error: `LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application DevNullSmtp.jar with error -10810.`Is this a GUI app or just a Unix executable?It shouldnt, because it gets those privs when you run it, and the rest of that is redirected to nothing at this point. Does this application require future input from you? Can you tell us what it is and what you use it for?GUI app, they have a console mode, but it is an interactive consoleIt is a dummy smtp server for dev purposes.  So I just tried it after the sudo password remembering timed out and it just presents 3 password prompts and exits.  I guess I have to run a dummy app first with sudo...how do you copy ~/Music/iTunes (old mac) to ~/Music/iTunes (new mac)If you wanted to run it without asking for a password, then yes, would need to run an app beforehand to cache it, but why not just put the password in after you start the smtp server?I would actually prefer to type in my password in this caseThe problem is the script that runs my app just quits.  You can't do `sudo appname &`.  Running it in the background doesn't give you the opportunity to enter your password.OK cool. I'll update my answer to explain this bit.It's also quite easy to delete a test user. I'll give an answer to cover that that's far simpler than the script above that is a little more thorough, but that extra checking and leaving a backup copy of an "empty" home folder is not warranted in the situation you describe.damn... that was easy... thank you!Or you could do it that way. :)I've spent over 30 minutes in fs_usage - the buffer overruns mean i'm missing most of the iTunes file accesses, and I'd guess the call is in a security framework and obfuscated or handled by usbmuxd or a helper. I'd rather not recompile fs_usage with a bigger buffer - but it's a bit of a needle in a haystack problem. I'm fairly certain the file isn't accessed in an observable manner at sync time... I've even tried running iTunes with DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_debug so it calls IO in debug mode which slows things down to lessen fs_usage's buffer overruns to no benefit.Wow - good effort!Same to you on that sharing post :)@boehj well it mentions "not loading `.bashrc`" but that's about it.Hi Todd thanks for the idea.  I did try this, and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't.  It definitely doesn't harm any data.  The way it doesn't work though is that it will try to shrink for a while, then just give up and say unable to do so.But that's *not* what I'm looking for. Not at all. I want to stream *to* iTunes running on a *Windows PC*. Not to my iPhone.Perhaps just the menubar icon has just 'froze'. Try (re)moving it by holding down command and dragging it, and perhaps re adding it?Thanks that worked. Though I went for the original Hitachi drive that one can get from newegg or from macsales.com http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Hitachi/0A57915/And how does this app not do that? My understanding is that by using the 'middleman' that is the 415 number, the 'middleman' records both sides of the conversation.Eh, your mileage may vary.  For what it's worth I hate, hate, *hate* auto-brightness but the iPhone's is less intolerable than the other implementations I've seen.  Keep in mind that it's hard to *objectively* judge how well-lit a location is, especially when it comes to fluorescent or natural light.  Fluorescent has the aggravating habit of appearing less bright than it is, and expecting the phone to determine what preset brightness level is appropriate is going to be a crapshoot at best.  Is this space dim enough to be preset A, or is the user just holding the device at a different angle?OK, sorry if I confused things here.Thanks Wayne for re-directing my question to the best Forum for it. Thanks timbooo for the link to the tutorial. I will test it. Best regards WilbourThanks for the help...Glad I could help you out :)Yes, I did. Although AppleScript doesn't report any error, MySQL server is not started. Please see update on question to see the output of commands.What you're after is `rsync`. This is a powerful cross-platform piece of software. It's on OS X & Linux distros out-of-the-box. There's some concern that the version of `rsync` that ships with OS X is outdated and doesn't handle resource forks and other things properly. `rsync` is 'smart' because it will only back-up the changed data. The rest of what you want can be achieved by a script but as to how to write such a script, I have no idea.+1 for rsync.   Used in combination with a cron job (or osx's equivalent) you'll have a bullet proof sync machine.ok i "up-ed" your answer because i thought it was good and will probably use this to help with other things but because its not wireless i accepted a different oneNo problem at all mate. That's the purpose of this place. To have a range of solutions to problems. I learned something out of this too, from the link provided by @hobs. :)Good luck! Let us know how it goes.Apple won't be making the data unavailable after the update, they're just going to stop including it in iTunes Device Backups. I.e., the phone still has and uses it.Well, that helps in that it keeps it from feeding the FTP into Firefox, but now it is launching the FTP in Finder. Closer, but not quite the complete solution. Is there perhaps something I am missing here?

Thanks for the tip so far.If the location data is not in the iTunes Device Backups and using a non-jailbroken phone, then it's unavailable right?accepted this one because it is has a solution (and it was the first of two near identical posts).Ok, tryed and works like a charm!glad it worked out out :)thanks for the answer. I tried the solution mentionned, but the problem remains.Thanks. Could you be please more specific on how and what to change? I've figured it out, but your answer seems incomplete this way.Like that or more ?By the way, I had to remove Chrome from Dock and put it back there to make the new icon appear in Dock (finder showed new icon right after I've changed the icns file).More, I guess, mention what icns files are there, how to edit them perhaps?This is probably what is called a "kernel panic" screen. Google for problems with RAM expanditure as well as "kernel panic" and you should definitely get some answers.I can confirm this fixed the problem, so thank you very very much!Glad I could be of assistance.I suppose you're point is valid that it could be more intelligent, but I believe it's design goals were simply to tweak a little more battery life out rather than function as an automated system.Pro tip - if possible, get a mount that is likely to be future proof. What I mean is watch out for mounts that are very custom that may not accommodate a potentially newly designed iPad 3/4. Some food for thought.You don't need to mount the target just use rsync protocol e.g. rsync options path target_machine::target_pathTanx @Calum this is work for me.@timbooo ok, thanks for the links. By the way, since it is 300 euros per year, maybe it is better to submit it to the app store and then download it for free... could you give me some info about it ?I think this might be a consequence of font smoothing.I don't think so. It's always the same font, in all pages and no matter what I try to change to Chrome font settings to. It's not a subtle difference in smoothing or anti-aliasing, it just looks horrible.Because of how Chrome updates, you will have to do this over and over again. Each time it pushes an update to you, it overwrites the old icon too.When (which version of Chrome) did it started to happen? I've not update to Chrome 11 yet, but I never had those issues with 10-. You tagged the question [gmail]. Does it only happens in gmail or every site?http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/whats-wrong-with-apples-font-rendering.html Check this out, it looks very much like font rendering differences. http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/06/font-rendering-respecting-the-pixel-grid.html also talks about it. However looking at my chrome and my safari I dont see it. This is weird.In order to submit an app to the app store you have to have at least a 99 dollars/year Developer subscription.I have Chrome 11.0.696.57 and I don't see the issue. This is likely a CSS being cached somewhere and failing to load (I have a similar issue every now and then, where chrome acts weird, but I usually close it and open it to fix it).@Patrick - well I think your company should decide on how to deploy your to your clients. I don't think it's that benefiting to use the App Store if the app does some internal stuff.I've noticed it from Chrome 10 and it's on all webbpages, not just Google Apps sites.I don't think that there could be a css caching problem. I've "rm -rf":ed all Google caches under $HOME/Library.Can you post a screenshot of your font settings?What version of Xcode are you trying to open. What exact model of Macbook Pro do you have?

As soon as I got home, it connected fine.i bought it from the apple store it was shipped to my housei am an apple developer, i downloaded from the app dev centeri am trying to download xcode 4.0 (IOS)@luca Can you post the screenshot of the error? Also, are administrator of your machine?yes i am the admin and i will post a screen shot in a few hours (unfortunately i am not at my mac right now but i will post as soon as possible)Since you're a developer, I don't think I need to be too much explanatory. Can you also check in Console.app (maybe while relaunching the install) to see if you have more information@Martin you will always have to do that anyway, or in the terminal type: "killall Dock" to restart the Dock, because it keeps a cached copy of the icon.@timbooo And what about syncing the iPads with an iTunes account built for the company ? Is there a limit to the number of iPads synced with iTunes (just to have the same app on all iPads) ? If this is not possible, I think still it is more convenient to pay 99$ rather than 300$ per year, and share the app in this way, as long as there are not privacy issues.I've now got mysql 5.5.11 (64-bit) to run on my Snow Leopard, and it was a very stupid mistake of mine, that was the cause of the server not starting. I needed to modify my my.cnf file, so that the option "skip-locking" was changed to "skip-external-locking" - you can also just replace the file with one from `PATH_TO_MYSQL/mysql/support-files` (remember to rename the file to my.cnf).@Mark that `::` syntax tells `rsync` that the target machine is running an `rsync server`. That's generally not common, and not necessary if you use the `/net` auto-mount approach.Right. But it's equally unavailable now. See my answer.OK I'll do as you suggest and go back to the old RAM.What about something waiting for a folder event, and then it checks the icon against a stored icon somewhere else?A folder action could potentially check for the icon upon certain action (opening?) but I suspect it's way TOO much work for replacing the icon of Chrome (as I suspect the user is trying to do). ;-)@hobs font rendering does not change the font family. Differences are in pixel-level and the underlying font is always the same. In this case Chrome 11 clearly has a serif font and Safari has a sans-serif font; see also the full-sized screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/JRbdW.png+1 for mentioning Chrome (11).Has anyone seen reviews on these products?Yeah it certainly would be a lot of work for an automatic icon change. You could probably just write a bash script to search the app bundle for the icon and replace it whenever it updates. Double click to replace.Sorry missed that comment, think it might have happened nearly the same time, I suspected that it might force you to reduce the speed of typing too much. Good luck fixing the keyboard soon though.@atroon I think that pref applies to closing one Terminal window, not the entire Terminal app.Man I forgot prime95, +1sure, but im not sure its gonna do much because xcode downloaded "successfully". Is also didn't crash cause it never opened@Patrick - according to [this](http://chimac.net/2010/05/24/does-itunes-have-a-device-limit/) and [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2439080?threadID=2439080&tstart=15) itunes does not have a device limit. So if you want to sync x iPads with 1 account you should be good to go. And if it shouldn't work, there are still the other options ;)I did have iTunes set to copy all files to its media directory.  After a FFR (WinXP) due to crash, I've copied the iTunes folder into the new iTunes folder, but the library was missing several playlists and album covers.  Am I missing something?The bonus of using this method to get your ellipsis is that it does not autocapitalize after it.  Try typing 3 periods and you get it followed by a Cap if you have autocap enabled.Playlists are stored in the itunes library.xml iirc, and the album art is meta data in the folders themselves. It is possible itunes did not pick this up or there might be an issue with the previous library.It's looking more like the keychain files are the source but I can't be sure at this point....What do you mean by "Apple's hardware test" ?I left it open and when I came back a few hours later I was unable to wake it up .... black screen and I had to shut it down with the power button :(From the usermanual: "Your MacBook Pro does not have any user-serviceable parts, except the hard drive and
the memory."  http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/MacBook_Pro_13inch_Mid2010.pdf (page 64 paragraph 1)There's no need to put the old HD back into the MBP, it's considered a "User serviceable part" (see comments in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13064/how-can-i-add-some-ssd-goodness-to-my-mbp#answer-13073)If you enter PII in them then of course the crash could very well contain it. There's nothing preventing the programmer from accessing network or device data inside their program so you would have to have access to the source code of the app to know if any particular crash would have privacy concerns.See its 'headphones' but not 'hands free' which is what my Motorola headset is (mic + mono 1 ear speaker).  I hate having hardware that is crippled by design... *sigh* I would love my headset for Skype.HFP is what I am looking for, and its crippled by design. I would love to have my Motorola paired with my iPod 4th gen for Skype.Great link - covers issues with wake from sleep and hibernate mode changes to help the system transition to a drive that's not what the mac firmware is expecting.It depends which model MacBook Pro you have. If you post the Model Identifier (like MacBookPro5,3) and whether the CD drive is on the SATA bus by looking at the system profiler.+ for crashplan. I use it along with dropbox and it's great.Yeah, sorry if I was being unclear, you definitely could not open fseventer while the poop proverbially hit the fan. I just meant more to give you an inkling into what kind of data was logged and viewable, as fs_usage would.Macs can supply more then 500ma. "To meet requests for additional power from these Apple peripherals and devices, some Apple computers and displays can provide up to 1100 mA at 5 V through the port to which the Apple peripheral or device is connected." http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049hear hear, unless you actually go through all the exposed data yourself, and therefore dont need the advice, you really can have no guarantees.+1 for lingon!!http://support.apple.com/kb/TA47831 How to backup and restore playlists, easiest way is to file>import playlist, and select the old itunes library.xml fileno difference between hard disk and hard drive in this context to me either.What about other services, can you for instance turn on file sharing and manually connect via cmd K?I loved learning about fseventer - look very nice. There is no failure - just data.Links aren't enough. Sites go down, and addresses change. It's pertinent to at least post relevant bits in case these problems occur. See the "Provide context for links" section of the [How To Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answer) page.@Nilloc if he uses a replacement kit and replaces the Optical drive with a hard drive, then that's not "user serviceable part". Since he wants to preserve his high capacity drive, his only choice is to replace the superdrive.But the problem returned today. I have filed a bug report to Apple and will be formatting my computer next week :/ok i added a screenshot of the error.Unsubstantiated answer, but this sounds like a bad install...@Ancide - What a bummer. Sorry to hear it didn't work out as planned.+1 for ScreenFlow - it's the cadillac/ferrari of tools for this. I would try the free demo and then get it on MAS if you like it for simplicity of updates.Of course, Flock has been discontinued, unfortunately. I don't remember whether [RockMeIt](http://www.rockmelt.com/) does blogging, and their site is particularly unhelpful.I'm struggling to see what 4th gen iPod has to do with bluetooth usefulness. Each release the capabilities get better and better. It's useful for streaming music, data between devices and accessories like GPS or headphones.thats what i am doing right now however I opened up Xcode in the Developer to debug this and got the same error message. If I was not able to open Xcode from my desktop i would probably have gotten an error similar to "could not locate the source"yeah thats why im re-installing it but i dont know how it could have been a bad instal if im doing it straight from apple and making no modfications, but i will see how my new instal goes (it will be done in 3 minuets)well apparently the re-instalation worked. Is there anyway to create a shortcut onto my desktop?well the re-instalation worked, but is there anyway to create a shortcut on my desktop@Luca590 sure! Find where it installed Xcode, then right click on it and choose "Make Alias". A new thing pops up called "Xcode alias" that you can move anywhere and name it anything you want.@timbooo So, does it work 100% ? Can anybody confirm this ? Just because I need to provide professional help to a company and it would be bad if this is not trueBy the way, isn't this strange ? Group of friends could buy songs and apps with the same iTunes account...ok, thank you .I think that the issue to look into solving is why the Sharing preference pane is crashing. Does the system.log tell you anything useful?But there's no way to remove the default dock correct? So using Docky or something else would leave you running two separate docks with different behavior. In addtion, I just did a quick check and docky (or awn) doesn't exist in the macports or fink repos. I think your first part is correct. Basically: "Impossible"Nice tip on entering the serial directly into the Apple Support search box.Although not a perfect solution, this is much better than it was before. I still have the problem on my domain's e-mail (can't set it up as an exchange account), but for gmail I only have to select the account and I can see the e-mail count for each folder.I agree - I hope IMAP and/or ActiveSync continue to get more powerful over time. The use case you propose is very clear and powerful. Thanks for my first bounty! WooHoo!Mac tracker is sick, I forgot about this, though its way better for seeing every mac that ever existed. +1+1  I am a Mac app "junkie", and I consider 1Password to be the most important app I use.+1 for suggestion to contact iTunes Support.  They are very helpful!To clarify it doesn't strip any third party or old Apple applications of PPC code it just replaces System Applications and files with Intel-only binaries. Rosetta is an optional download for Snow Leopard to aid in Intel transition. It is recommended to replace PPC applications with Intel native applications as Rosetta will no longer be supported after Snow Leopard.possible duplicate of [Can user accounts be managed via the command line?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4814/can-user-accounts-be-managed-via-the-command-line)The 2011 MacBook Pros can actually handle 16GB, despite apple's statements. (See: http://blog.macsales.com/9394-macbook-pro-2011-12gb-and-16gb-memory-upgrades-benchmarked )I can't tell if it works 100% - I've never done it personally. Sorry.Mostly, 8GB SO-DIMMs are just ridiculously expensive (~$800)But when I synch the devices it comes up with "There are purchases on this iDevice - do you want to transfer them?" So I have to make sure I haven't downloaded anything directly and then click no. Kind of annoying.You can always deauthorize other computers from iTunes Advanced -> DeauthorizeBear in mind that this only opens a new macvim window **not** a new terminal window.You can check that iTunes is not connecting with Apple's server if you use LittleSnitch and deny iTunes Internet access. You can also simply disconnect from Internet and the results are going to be the same.(I rebooted, and it has persisted fine :)Thank you - this has answered my problem, too. I have a PDF in which the pages are somehow double-height A4, so to print normal size I have to split each page into two. I used your suggestion and cropped each page, printed, used undo and then cropped each one again the other way and printed again. Takes a little time but it's simple and easy, thank you again!@palaniraja not always. only once a year.@Cawas - I think that has changed and you can deauthorize any time.Rob, [you're wrong](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1420). But I were wrong too. I thought and meant about the *deauthorize all* process, but that might not be what palaniraja meant. Regardless, the steps he gave can be repeated as many times as you want, as long as you have *access* to that computer.@timbooo ok, one last question, just to be sure. If I want to install the app on my own iPad, do I need to submit it to the appStore, or can I just install it without paying any developer fees ?It's going to be a Macbook Pro with the 2.2Ghz i7. The software we need to run is mostly bespoke scientific software it's fairly intensive so I'm not sure virtulization is going to cut it.Virtualization doesn't have that much of an impact on purely computational load, and of course you've got a powerful processor in that processor. It's up to you of course but you may want to try a virtualized solution using a trial VM product and an unactivated copy of Windows 7.  You can run in that configuration for 30 days to see if it works for you before committing to it.[Intel-based Macs: Using Apple Hardware Test](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509)Regarding number 2: you can move your OEM versions to another computer, you have to reauthorize it. It works.Yes, Cawas is the winner. You can deauthorize an individual computer as often as you'd like, but you can only deauthorize all annually. You'd really only do that when you've had to reinstall your OS, forgot to deauthorize the machine, and already had all the authorizations used. So almost never.Quite true.  Thanks for pointing it out.Is your friend using another Unix-y system? Or are they one Windows? Because that might change the answer.Wow, thanks for the tip on 'fs_usage'. And yeah, I figured it wasn't actually fseventsd causing the load, but rather some other program. I expect a loop somewhere. As an aside, machine has been running normal load for 24 hours or so, and it hasn't happened again.Hopefully it's not Time Machine, since this is disabled! Anyway, I'm reading up on fseventer, so thanks for the suggestion.Are you claiming that private data (instance values) go into Stack Traces?

I know the device GUID does, but what else do you claim goes into a Stack Trace that is private?Any filesystem will have problems considering circumstances. But "Fragile" and "A Little Outdated"? Really? A little outdated in my mind is no Journaling. And that's not the case for HFS+.That shouldn't be the case, when you tap hold, the other line is muted entirely in both directions.For what it's worth, I have the exact same problem, mostly when streaming from my iPod/iPhone/MBP to my AppleTV: it'll be working fine and then suddenly AppleTV can't find the devices until I cycle the iDevice's wifi connection. Resetting the router has had no long-lasting effect for me. I read somewhere that it has to do with WPA2 encryption, which I also use. Most likely, it's the router or the router's implementation of WPA2. Make sure your router's firmware is up-to-date.Oh ok..I thought there will be no preloaded IOS on the iPad...I mean atleast that was the case when I first bought the iPod Touch...Actually, you can option click on Update and apply other ipsw's without jailbreaking.Sorry but By ipsw's do you mean IOS S/W and where do I download the same from ?What do you mean by it not coming preloaded with an iOS version? It probably won't have the latest updates, but it should come with iOS 4.3 or thereabouts.jmlumpkin, I've modified my answer to clarify it, but the only ipsws (firmware version, hmthr) that you'd be applying are the same ones that come through iTunes, so that just adds complexity with no benefit.  Hmthr just wants to make sure the device is up to date, as I understand it.Thanks for sharing this, however this "manual" process mimics the jailbroken app's behavior and does not work. I am messing with the Bluetooth PLIST's now, so hopefully I'll come up with something on that route.Alright, sorry I couldn't be of more help!I dont think that is possible without a jailbreak from the way the ipad works unless they made a web browser app that had this functionality built in.No - the app store rules try to prevent that sort of thing (self modifying code and all) - but nothing prevents that if the programmer wants to get creative in encoding data for remote debugging. It's very unlikely but data on the ARM registers could be private. Highly, highly unlikely - perhaps I should edit my answer to be less strong? I'd not want my aggregated crash logs or CrashReporter Key to be public record. The crash report was intentionally designed to not share private data, but programs crash when they don't behave as planned.The fan moves, but is probably shock rated higher than most human knees. I would recommend a cloth to separate the screen from the keyboard and don't let other heavy items move relative to the air. Air are thin and will bend or dent even in a soft bag if something denser is allowed to move in the case while you "run".It's separate from the backup process. That starts after the verify phase is complete.Yeah the "verifying software" message during a restore is definitely a phone home, a verifying during a sync however is doubtful.A friend of mine bought his MBP in this configuration from one of the shops.... if you have an Apple Store or similar near your place you could also asked them to do it (if this is an option for you).@Patrick - Since this is too specific for me try these links: [Deploying iPone Apps to Real iPhone] (http://mobiforge.com/developing/story/deploying-iphone-apps-real-devices) [Stack Overflow Search] (http://www.google.de/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=how+to+deploy+company+iphone+app+to+clients#sclient=psy&hl=de&source=hp&q=site:stackoverflow.com+how+to+deploy+company+iphone+app+to+clients&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=29ba8719137c5168)@Ben Ah, that explains it. Didn't think you could do it for free anymore.That looks like it could be a hardware problem (with the backlight and screen). In the photo, the part at the bottom edge of the screen meets the black is kinda bumpy. Are you sure it's SMC?@Rob there are (see [this Apple Support article](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509)), but they probably won't catch something like this. The best way to tell for sure: compare your computer with another like it, or take it to the Apple store and ask them.Yeah that looks like a failing monitor, I would also take it to the apple store or call the applecare number and have them set you up with a repair.good question thoOK, thank you... I think I'm gonna wait if everything is OK for a few days. Next time it fails, I'l try to make an appointment in an Apple store.Thank you for all your advises !yeah thats probably the best solution simply because t shouldn't be failing (obviously), but its fairly uncommon to have to restart your SMC. Hopefully its only a one time problem so you dont have to take it back to them to look at it, but i apple has a good reputation for trust worth machines so i wouldnt yet base all of their products off this experienceThanks Harv for the tagging thing :)@Rob no problem. The Apple Store will fix or replace it for free since it's a new computer.I have a similar problem but in another "domain". I have apps on my iPhone that were bought on a second account, which is also inconvient when checking for app updates. I googled a lot on the issue and have not found a solution that would allow to merge 2 accounts. Annoying, I know.I could not open this link, could u send it to me again?http://www.tranquilapps.com/   opens for me fineWow! @Austin that works, thank you, do you happen to know tho answer to my original question too? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11855/how-can-i-enable-internet-sharing-without-using-the-gui-or-apple-script-on-snow-lonly trouble is, you cannot post into two social networks with one action. You have to "select twitter", post, then select facebook, and re-post. Unless I'm missing this feature.Ah, you're probably right; I haven't used it myself, but knew that it handled multiple networks.That works. However, this transaction is all in plain/text and not encrypted correct?I think the question was about remapping keys for example <kbd>d</kbd> would behave as <kbd>e</kbd> (if it were switched to a dvorak layout, not assigning shortcuts.is your question about redefining shortcuts for commands or "really" for keys as Nilloc understands your question?OK, but how to add a skype id to a address book contact ?I also can send , edit my SMS from nokia using Nokia software from myPC  , is it possible from iphone?Not that I'm aware of - maybe if you jailbreak your iPhone, but I don't know about this issue.A quick Google search gave me this link: http://www.iphonesmstransfer.com/how-to-edit-iphone-sms-messages-in-computer.html - but not a free program. And this: http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/08/read-iphone-sms-backup/tnx, I used it, it works :)Thanks Mike. :)Glad to see one of these worked out!As it's already answered **yes, it's possible but no, that's not a good reason to do it - it does come installed**. By the title of the question I thought it would be "how can I download / update iOS directly from iPad, without connecting". Now *that* would have been a very good question to which I have no answer! :PDavid, read the other answer. I like yours better because it's shorter, but it's wrong in saying "no". Because it **is** possible - and not hard at all.We need the name of the third party app as it sounds like it is talking about the documents folder thats customized via the app, or on your computer, which is ~/Documents or C:/Users/username/Documents respectively.There are (too) many things other phones can do that iPhone can't. The most annoying ones are also the most common, such as easily and freely transferring files (or even photos), SMS, Notes, Call History... At least contacts you can do with freaking iTunes.wow.  interesting point. thanks!thanks a lot hobsshouldn't this question have been migrated to webapps or something? But I'm glad Kevin got his answer anyway.Are you sure it was deleted, and not moved out of sight? You can find all your files backed up by iTunes under `~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup` but it can be quite tricky to find your document there.+1 for *a tool*'s linkThat's some kind of cool.@hobs it is, isn't it? :P  also, under "view and manage" you can export everything to `KML` (and Google Earth) as well.Same happens to me.

I don't quite understand the question, mike, but *maybe* [this](https://github.com/Chronic-Dev/libirecovery) helps.Try activating Spaces (the default 2x2 arrangement of spaces is fine), then pressing Ctrl+1,2,3,4. You should move to a different Space each time- does this work when you hit Ctrl+3 and Ctrl+4?@HandyRandy - I have no idea which of the options - the current method or the method I'm suggesting - would have the least impact on the battery.@Kerin - "Less intolerable" - I love it!  I don't think the logic to adjust the brightness to match preset levels would be too difficult.  The light sensor wouldn't have to match exactly; it could do so within some margin of error.  It would be like the your comment about figuring out the right level.  It wouldn't have to be exact just as the current system isn't exact.Fission is a good utility for extracting Audio Data from a Video FIle, and I was getting ready to do it the old fashioned way, track by track, manually. Not my preference.

I had the idea afterward to Applescript it, but unfortunately it appears that Fission does not have an AS Dictionary.@Jason considered some UI scripting to talk to Fission?Is that generally primitive Applescript when a given app doesn't have a dictionary?

Click the menu named "File". Click the menu item named "Save".

Stuff more or less like that?@Jason yep. But may be better than doing it by hand, depending on how many of these you plan on chugging through.@matthias: Yes, CTRL+3 and CTRL+4 works perfectly with Spaces. It must be some shortcuts I've defined that Spaces is overriding, but I have no idea where.Yeah I just had nothing to add.That doesn't work, the results shows iPad apps that are in HD but not for an external television. (Such as Angry Birds HD). My question is not how to find such apps, rather for letting other users list new TV compatible apps.  I'll rewrite the original question.Not sure what's the specific problem you have but several trigger-related bugs has been fixed since b59 and they will be available in b60.Just want to mention that QS is still under an active development. Although backtree no longer maintain QS, it was given to opensource community and now is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/quicksilver/Quicksilver).

Such as the game I listed (Real Racing 2 HD) plays full screen and converts the iPad as a separate secondary screen.@Martin Marconcini: That may be technologically possible, it's not valid according to Microsft: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/installing-oem-windows-7-on-another-computer-after/6b2b3491-bc5f-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5300 iOS devices? Either you are super-rich or you a really good reason to be using 300 devices :)Thanks, but I did have pinch enabled and the "zoom thing" worked but it was not smooth. It works in very rough steps - 100%, 120% 140% or so.... instead I would like it to zoom smoothly from 100% trough 101%, 102%  all the way downActually, what I want is my desktop safari to zoom like preview....Nice to see I'm not the only one still doing this on an original iPhone!@Tegbains an OEM Windows copy is tied to some hardware pieces (like HDD serial among others). However, it's known that some of those components may fail and have to be replaced thus causing Windows to fail auth. What Microsoft thinks is valid or not is entirely useless in Europe, since the EULA is less valid than a 3 Dollar paper. If you wanted you could go to MS and request a refund for your "unused" Windows Copy. It's a gray area. All I'm saying is that technically you can authorize it again. (probably not a lot of times tho')My employer funded these activities. :-) We managed substantially more than 300 devices - that's just the max we had connected to one single mac over a normal week's span.You fix it by asking apple to create a True Resolution Independent operating system. Until then you're stuck with whatever algorithm they chose for zooming.Be careful - you generally can't upgrade or downgrade without making sure the break works with both the specific version of firmware / iOS level on the device before and after the break. You may want to be very fastidious about making sure of the firmware levels before you upgrade / reload the device.I think you're interpreting the need to activate an iOS device with iTunes before being able to unlock it as there is not a OS preloaded when shipped. I can see where you may assume that, but it's not the same thing. There is no OS download required for activation. It just "unlocks" it.Unfortunately, the zoom in and zoom out functions are hard coded to jump in largeish increments. The pinch options just trigger an increment after they detect your much finer pinches over a period of time.I guess you are not clear about the first part of my Question. A *Factory Unlocked* and an *third party Unlocked* iPhone are different. Both works with any SIM but  Factory Unlocked ones are apple verified. I was asking if it's a *Factory* unlocked or just a third party *unlocked* one.I hadn't noticed this, but I had a similar thing on my system. The Spaces shortcut keys CTRL+digit worked for switching to a space even though in the System Preferences the shortcut key setting was set to "-". I changed it to "^ Number Keys" and then back to "-" and then they really were disabled. Thanks for pointing that out.I am not sure, but if xcode projects are bundles of files you may have permissions to open the top level directory but not the subsequent subfiles and subfolders. Try chmod -r 777 /Users/username/pathtoproject file, and see if that allows you to open it.but why am i not able to open it normally. I was opening it just fine yesterday and never made any changes to the administrative settings, but now its not letting me open it.Honestly, I wouldn't have a clue. I am just telling you how to modify permissions recursively to see if the permissions problem will go away.i can also open the subfolders (classes) individually but it still wouldn't let me open them in a project.how are you listing the shortcut? CMD + < or CMD + SHIFT + ,Did you try the terminal command I wrote? You could also probably open the top level folder, get info on it, open the permissions and sharing section, and when you click to unlock the lock and select the gear, you can choose "Apply to subfolders" or something of the like to apply the correct permissions to all the files and folders within it.i ran your terminal command but it didnt open the project. and the only options i found under the gear were to "reverb changes"Weird, I tried messing with the owner and permissions but I cant make the gear only show me one option http://i.imgur.com/erW7n.png , maybe someone has a better idea about this than me.I got a Jawbone ERA and it does the job, still not sure whether this is possible with the ICON.Yes Cawas...I agree with you and the answer given by jmlumpkin...I mean coz that is what my question actually was..well thanks for trying. I just need to get more people to view this question.i dont know you might have to do it manually or i bet theres probably a program that dos it for you. I might even write skype asking them to add this feature.are you asking if there is a utility that opens a terminal window and then closes it after your done? cause technically "Terminal" does what your asking@luca590 I am asking for an application that opens a terminal window with a shortcut; I can reset my Mac, but I want to still be able to open a terminal window with a shortcut.you can copy terminal and paste it to your desktop or where ever you feel necessary if that is sufficientand more people to vote it up so it gets more viewsIt sounds like the problem is more with your hardware if there's background noise. Also, you're being pretty general. We can't tell you what will work best for use in an iPhone app. You need to tell us more about the sounds, the effects you've tried, and the results you've gotten.Settings shortcut is `CMD + i`. For example `CMD + <` says is used for `Windows -> Next Window` (don't know the actual english equivalent, i'm using a german Mac OS)Questions about programming tools should be off-topic, basing on the [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq), with the exceptions reported in the FAQ.German `cmd + <` has the english equivalent of cmd + ` (backtick).@kiamlaluno I appreciate your vigilance about off-topic questions, but in this case it seems like XCode is incidental to the question - this question seems to be more about file permissions, and would likely be closed on Stack Overflow, so I'll allow it to stay.I've got an AZERTY keyboard.. so `<` is actually a keyI assume you want to replace the functionality of 'delete' with the functionality of 'cmd+delete'. Is this correct?It is Duplicate!@ptamzz That hack (gevey) Mike mentioned [should be prove](http://www.iphonedownloadblog.com/2011/03/27/musclenerd-confirms-the-gevey-sim-iphone-4-unlock-is-illegal/) there might **never** be some way to know for sure if an iPhone was genuinely factory unlocked.@Nathan, not really sure what you want at this point.  At first I thought you wanted a custom aspect ratio so I explained that.  Then I thought you wanted a custom aspect ratio as part of a normal aspect-ratio movie, hence it needed bars or something to 'fill in' the rest (or cropping which you can do with the effects) and now you're saying you don't want that either.  So at this point, I'm really not clear as to what you're trying to do.  Can you try again to re-clarify what your goal is?Perhaps sketch a quick illustration on paper, snap it with your cellie... upload it somewhere and link here in your question so we can see.ok, but the problem remains. How to turn it of if it isn't in the keyboards prefpane.ok turning of `CMD` + ` worked!I took a crack at it.  Hope it helps!I don't intend to do this for one reason (unless I'm wrong, please feel free to correct me): Recompression. The video files already have significantly compressed audio data, and I wish to preserve the original audio data as much as possible. Fission's killer feature is "lossless editing and reexporting".

Not to even mention that GarageBand is really really slow for tasks like this :/.

However, this is a wonderful solution for a task that fulfills the subject, so I've +1'ed you for that aspect.I disagree! If you zoom on iPhone or iPad you get high quality screen but bigger...You are right. But it doesn't have to be that way... If you zoom on iPhone or iPad you get fantastic quality... They just need to implement the same thing as in iOS... Currently as things stand... It's not what most of the people expect to get - I think.Hm, clearing the cache didn't help. Also it seems that a changed URL won't even get recognized, since it is still using the wrong file extension.You're right, missed that part of the question. Time to get more sleep.This doesn't work for (believe me I tried). When I open the file after taking these steps they get opened in `Applescript Editor`also note that in the lingo cmd+backspace = delete and fn+backspace = (forward) delete; just backspace = just backspace.paste the code here and i'll see what i can do.Whoa. I really think I **could** *live without* this application. :-D though the read out loud option may be useful to someone.@Marque The second thing you said is mostly correct: I want to crop one clip of a project to an aspect ratio that is not standard and letterbox it. This is what my question says. You answer, unfortunately, didn't work when I tested it.The expanding is because the files are MIME encoded http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME so one byte will be mapped to more@luca590: Where is the project located? On an internal hard drive or an external one. I'm thinking that if the project is on a server share, that may be the cause of the problems.@Cawas @hobs: Thank you for the answer. Is there a way to forcibly install a new ipsw file?@Austin man that's cool, it turns out that even if I make the /etc/bootpd.plist if just touch it or copy the content you providid into it (even if I set its permission to 444) it would be removed when I run `/usr/libexec/InternetSharing` but the cool thing is that I can connect to my mac from my iPad now! and SSH into it. It still does not route the packets out so I don't have Internet on my iPad but that is progress. By the way the AirPort icon changes to an upward arrow which I think is the Interent sharing sign. I am also a Dropbox fan!@Austin by the way '/usr/libexec/InternetSharing' does not return for me (I joust get stuck until I hit ctrl-c) and I don't see the third line of what you mentioned above (the 'InternetSharing[40307]: no primary service specified, exiting').If you email the file to yourself, it can be done. See my answer below.Looks like I may need to find my Snow Leopard disc...Worked perfectly - thank you so much!@vxjasonxv you don't have to.

It's described in one of the links from my answer.@Mark: thanks for your help. I was quite relieved as I heard from the recipient that the sent files still had the same size there. :-)   
However: If a mail server has a restriction concerning file size, e g. "5 MB", is this the size of the "real files" or the size of the MIME encoded message?Thanks for your help. I was quite relieved as I heard from the recipient that the sent files still had the same size there. :-)   
However: If a mail server has a restriction concerning file size, e g. "5 MB", is this the size of the "real files" or the size of the MIME encoded message?its great to finally know theres a good way to do this.@Ali Interesting that it hangs before exiting...  Could be a symptom of the same problem that is plaguing your pref panes.  Perhaps try taking a look at the Console (`/Applications/Utilities/Console.app`) and see if there are any useful messages there.  The "up arrow" is an indication of AirPort Internet Sharing, so that's a good sign, at least.What do you mean by updated ? Is there a pending software upgrade waiting for a restart to be installed ?I updated my Mac and it restarted after that. I don't thing anything is pending.Is it just asking for your login credentials each time, or does it not even try connecting to the network at all?@Austin, It gets stuck, it does not crash, in the console I see "5/2/11 3:30:18 PM UserEventAgent[410] **** ERROR: SCNetworkSignatureCopyActiveIdentifiers returned nil" . Which according to this header file (http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/configd/configd-210/SystemConfiguration.fproj/SCNetworkSignature.h?txt) should return a list of available networks or something.@Austin, Do you know if I can just enable routing (packet forwarding) between the two network interfaces? that is I believe the last piece of my puzzle.What version of OS X are you running?  Is the iMac still in its stock configuration (no HDDs replaced)?  How do you know that the disks are not sleeping (apart from a higher power consumption, which may be due to something else)?Also, this may be a silly suggestion, but try setting "disksleep" to 1 or 3.  Right now "sleep" and "disksleep" are both set to 2 minutes, so perhaps the sleep occurring at the same time is interfering somehow?Sorry, but there's not nearly enough information here to help you troubleshoot this problem.  Please edit the question to provide machine/OS specs, a detailed description of how you first encountered the problem, steps you perform that reliably repeat the problem, and any relevant error messages from the console (`/Applications/Utilities/Console.app`).@Ali You may be looking for the NAT daemon (`/usr/sbin/natd`)?  Docs here: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/natd.8.html  Be sure to follow the steps at the bottom first.@Martin mail server restrictions are usually based upon the size of the message itself (the server really doesn't know much about MIME, it only receives and transmits bytes). The size that the mail server uses is the MIME encoded message, since that is the real size of the data that the server has to store.Another random idea that might help - check the `Console.app` for some clue. Maybe you get lucky.Oh, thanks! I didn't really think the link would actually be substantive in that manner.Are you asking how to record the sounds in the first place, or how to use existing files you have? What is "the ad hoc version"?$700 to be able to bill thousands for a single case to the government or a big time law firm is chump change. Also weeds out the one star reviews and means you can afford good support staff. The framework you linked to is awesome for accessing things once the device is unlocked but doesn't appear to jimmy the passcode lock using certificates from a host computer.please forgive my ignorance once again, but who's jimmy?It's a colloquial verb - my apologies for using slang. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jimmythat's cool. :) now... what exactly you wanted to accomplish here? :P@bmike could you confirm your suspect?I'll post an answer with the suspicions I have so far...Each time i connect, i have to go through the 'Join Other Network' option from the airport menu, and then add the Network name and logon credentials, works fine after i do that, but does not persist the definitionI'll try that next!It worked!

They won't stream into the app in real time.[TSP Solver for OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman) says that IPhone is supported platform. There is [online solver using Google Maps](http://www.josef-graef.de/karten/tsp/index.html)I would try also to connect via a third-party vpn app, to see its behavior. [Viscosity](http://www.thesparklabs.com/viscosity/) is my favorite. Although it costs $9, it has a 30 days trial so you can see if it works.That is why I asked for a simple utility. `:-)`@Neil Yes, you have actions for iTunes play, pause, rewind, next song, play/pause, increase/decrease volume, etc. Those are usually applescripts so you could create new ones if you need something else.actually, the automator app works just fine.. All I need now is a way to change the icon for all files of a certain extension (say `.tex`).Thanks Nicholas, that is what i expected, but thought i'd ask.  The quality of the HTML that qlmanage creates is pretty excellent, do you know if textutil uses the same libraries?Nope (I addressed this in my the first sentence of my response).  Apple has 3 different Office importers/exporters: the doc/docx I/O in Cocoa Text (which is what textutil uses), the iWork importers/exporters (*Compatibility.framework, which you'll find in the bundles of each iWork app), and the Quick Look/iOS previewers (the private OfficeImport.framework).  The latter two share quite a bit of code, and tend to be more robust/capable because they support the iWork feature set rather than just that of Cocoa Text.Ok, thanks for your expertise!Thanks Austin for you help. I am ok with the slow version because I do need it for an experiment. But unfortunately the only thing about Virtual PC that I have found so far is the updater which is the same as the link in your comment but I have failed to find the main program to install. Do you know where I can find it?

I will also be going to test the Q emulator. Thanks.Thanks thats exactly what I needed to know.Also, I feel a bit like an idiot now. There was no need to remove the tri-wing screws and take out the battery.  I could have just taken the bottom case off (easy) and disconnected the battery connector cable (also easy).  Oh well, the more you know!+ 1: Very clever re: mapping it to the mouse.Yes, thats why I linked to that PR, I knew that they had their own database - just didn't know if there was a way to refresh it yet. I know I have all this already turned on. But like the last sentence of your answer, my assumption is correct - that Im not missing any front end to update it manually.what if I don't have trackpad?...All macbooks have a trackpad.Oh, and I am pretty sure it works with just two fingers, exactly like it does in OS X (as long as you have the drivers installed)have you tried connecting an external monitor? - just to make sure if its the graphics card or the monitor in your mbp.Is the new folder in OSX Mail  in Gmail or "ON MY MAC"Yes, that's one of the nice things about getting Apple stuff.@Reza Q is quite good, but doesn't have all the features of the "mainstream" emulation platforms.@Petruza but your keyboard sends the same keycodes should you work on files or chars.Strictly speaking, "virtualization" is where both the host and guest see the same processor architecture (i.e. x86 in Intel Macs with Windows VMs). "Emulation" is where the host and guest see different architectures (i.e. PowerPC Mac OS running Windows on x86), and is what you want to do. While they're close enough that everybody will know what you're talking about, the distinction may help your search.I fear I forgot to reply, so thanks timbooo for all help! Wilbourok it let me in. How did u do that?if you send me the whole stacktrace I can give you a more accurate idea of where is Safari blowing. (Hint gmail at my last name) ;)You can mark an answer as accepted if it worked for you, and maybe will for others.Wolff - Cheers mate!thanks. But is there a system call or command line utility or some API to do this. I tried both the utilities you mentioned already and they don't work for me (I can't get to 100 Hz in 1280 x 1024 and I am sure my Monitor supports it).Downvotes should generally be commented -- what's the reason here?  This answer is on-topic and correct, even if not the best solution for the OP.  LastPass is a more robust, cross-platform solution than Mobile Safari's built-in AutoFill, and their iPad browser is just a re-packaged version of Safari with their additional feature.Downvotes should generally be commented -- what's the reason here?  This answer is on-topic and correct, and I did more than just say "no".@Reza There are many people selling it on eBay -- try searching `Virtual PC Mac`, and be sure to get a recent version (v6 or v7).  Looks like most copies have sold for $10-40 recently.Although this is the default location, Aperture will allow you to store masters anywhere. And you don't have to keep all the images in the same place - some on external drives, some offline drives, some in the cloud. It's best to export files out of aperture or use the image browser to locate them. Use care not to move the files using Finder out from under Aperture or its database will break.Oh thanks, had no idea I needed the laptop version. Newegg even has a Mac memory section, maybe even more pertinent: http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=551&name=Mac-Memoryhttp://www.ramjet.com/ has good information on what their engineers have determined will work. They have a long history of pushing memory safely past what Apple officially recommends but still making it simple to find the right memory and not selling you something that won't work with your specific mac. Look for a guarantee or return process that speaks to what happens if you order the wrong memory. Sometimes better spec'ed ram works, sometimes is does not.Also, in iOS 4 you can disable wireless 3G/Edge data use altogether in settings, including on your home network.  If you want to force WiFi while not travelling (e.g. to manage a quota), you can do it.@RobZolkos You're absolutely right -- and that's absurd.+1 Amazingly, this seems to be the only way to do this right now.This is far from the best solution - see the other answer that you simply hold the normal apostrophe until the menu of many variations of the character pops up and select the backtick by sliding your finger and releasing when it's over the ` character on iOS.It's "On My Mac."Papers2 looks great but I was not able to identify a way of adding cites with notes and page numbers. At least in Bookends this is supported. In addition I find quite awkward that their support forum is not very active and is tightly moderated - I have a bad feeling about this.I'm glad it worked for you, I see the question got transferred from Stack Overflow so I didn't see your reply!The building blocks needed for this app are present in the API - apps like NetFlix and MLB at bat can keep the display from sleeping, but there doesn't seem to be a tool custom built for this RSS. Something like porting the RSS screen saver code would need to be added to an app that disabled normal power savings - perhaps only when docked to power.remember there could be some apps to blame and sometimes closing / removing them also helps a lot.If you're looking for suggestions to achieve a specific, measurable performance improvement, you should mention your system specs in more detail, the current boot time, and the programs that are being run at startup.Can I improve cold startup with hibernation or similar? What startup times would I get in such a case (with or without SSD)?'Crossfire' means 2 (AMD) GPUs. What you describe is a single GPU system.Rob - Thanks for the link - this tool will be invaluable for cleaning up my keychains programatically.my mistake, edited and corrected accordinglytell me about it! I've spend the last 10 minutes exploring :)Let's say it is just a new off the shelf iMac 27" quadcore 1TB 4GB.After weighing up all the options I've gone for this approach.  Thanks for the tip about running all the updates and laying out the commands in a clear manner.Thanks for the response, you can also tap the mouse with two fingers to right click. This was working, until 4 days ago. I have been googling like crazy and i found out that an update last week killed that function. I guess i have to wait until a patch comes out.Thanks a lot Martin, you made several good points, and most certainly keep them inton account. Take it easy.Great feedback here and with Hobs' more robust (and more complicated) script. I've relied on this many tens of times to freshen up a machine for a new user.Thanks, is there any way to do it so that the folders will be on my mac? Essentially I want to keep the system like it is now, but make it so that when I move emails to folders "on my mac," they are archived on Gmail rather than deleted.Damn that's a good list.If Gmail parses the messages into folders, will Mail.app also be able to parse and move the messages as well? I want to have a local copy of all my messages.The only way I could see that is if you copied the message in your rule, but I have not tried that. Do you just want to have an offline copy? If Gmail parses them - then they would appear in the IMAP folders on the server, which would then show up in Mail.app - but wouldn't be in the 'On My Mac' folder. You also could possibly make a copy with AppleScript for every email but that would be rather tedious.Definitely agree with you. Homebrew is, IMHO, the best package management system anywhere.I have a pair of Mushkin Enhanced 2GB in my MBP and they work great, the 8GB version is $84 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820226167Please provide proof (via a link w/ instructions or something). I've been working with JavaScript for a long time and have never come across any sort of "invisible window". I'm very skeptical.No - "on my mac" implies ONLY on your mac. Don't fret as  your mac keeps a local copy of "all the messages" so even though the "authoritative" master copy is online, your mac mail has a local copy of everything to speed things up and allow offline access with sync later when you reconnect. There is no benefit to having the folder on your mac other than that it deletes the original from gmail.Although this may well be true, it seems a really odd design move to leave off SATA 3 support.@Austin Lingon isn't free.Really, with light to moderate use, you only have to restart once a month.I'm curious about the statement "Some apps don't run so well in Server". Do you have examples?I totally agree.@bitbonk: That still leaves two things unanswered: your current boot time, and the things being run at startup.Time machine doesn't back everything up, many third party extensions are still not ready for a 64 bit kernel, iLife/iWork and other apps have way more bugs and less thorough testing on server os.In would say that server admin tools are the opposite of tedious given the alternatives for other server os tools. Getting those tools integrated with the server software is why people pay for server in the first place, not a reason to avoid it.Nice one. Once again this site proves to be a fountain of quality info. :)@bmike I'm sorry but your "iLife/iWork and other apps have way more bugs and less thorough testing on server os" doesn't make any sense. I have OS X Server on two machines and I've never ever experienced any different behavior on iLife, iWork or even Aperture. The operating system's core is exactly the same, with Server having more services and more tools to configure those services. I still believe it's not a good idea to run your "own" server on a startup but for different reasons. That machine he posted is more than capable to run server and his local performance will be unaffected.@Nathan My iMac is completely without power (unplugged) when not in use. So I HAVE to do some sort of cold start. I want to reduce that as much as possible. See my updated question.@Nathan My iMac is completely without power (unplugged) when not in use. So I HAVE to do some sort of cold start. I want to reduce that as much as possible. See my updated question.I don't have any concrete numbers, I just want to get a basic idea.Maybe buy a notebook with a battery? Then you can just close the lid to put mac to sleep and open lid to wake it up in a second.Great answer. Now there is just one thing left, by how much approximately can I improve a cold wakeup if I had an SSD.mine has just stopped backing up, citing 'not enough space' as the issue.I can't speak from experience as don't have one - but I'd imagine in or around 5 seconds should be feasible. The amount to data that needs to be moved will vary. The OS tries to be smart about what needs to be written, depending on how much memory is in use.Autolock after timeout is deactivated. The behaviour is like this: I have the Keychain icon enabled in my menu bar. After the Mac wakes up from sleep it shows the lock closed. When an application tries do access a password now, the lock remains closed for some of them, for others the lock is opened afterwards! When its opened, also *other* applications can access the keychain without asking for the password. I just wonder how it is determined if the entire keychain is unlocked after entering the password or if only the item is unlockedOh. Ok. Have you looked in the logs in the Console application to find out a bit more information? Does it say anything useful? Open up Console (in /Applications/Utilities) and search for 'backup'. How big are the drives you have?backup drive - 500gb, main drive - 450gb (it has a partition that is not backed up)Cydia does have VNC clients and most likely would have VNC servers as well... But, from my experience, VNC is often the worst and oldest option to remote controlling anything - there's always something newer and better.@Arthur While I could figure out what you meant in your comment, could you please use the standard lowercase-b for bits and uppercase-B for bytes? That way your second sentence is: "SATA 2 tops out at 3Gb/s which is 375MB/s". You clearly know what you're talking about, it's just hard to understand your comment without pulling out my calculator.Yeah and if that goes wrong you think it went right and you use it and half your ear gets cut off.not bad, not badDon't make fingerprints. In South Korea people use sausages as styli because when it's cold those people use gloves. If you just use sausages you won't get any fingerprints on the screen, only sausageprints.Is that a microfiber cloth? Oh, hehe I use it to lay my iPod on when it's syncing so the backside doesn't scratch. Didn't know it was for cleaning.What do you want to do with it? Are you a hard core gamer or a die hard iOS developer? Those are totally different things. :)Edit: thanks @CajunLuke, good catch :). With the new Vertex 3 there'd be a huge difference. SATA 2 tops out at 3Gb/s which is 375MB/s. The Vertex 3 rates at aorund 550MB/s read/write, you'd be losing out on 175MB/s. SATA 3 tops out at 6Gb/s which is 750MB/s, giving you plenty of bandwidth.Why don't you want to use the installer?Many thanks for your advice10x, So i can test on it for now? no problems? I don't like that, I want it the way apple intended it to be. But for now, untill i get hold of the place and get there, and kick some ass, I can work and test on it with no problems at all?I have this disabled for all my iPods and iPads so I guess I can safely remove it from the list?@RadekS: Yes, you can.I'll generalize that 95% of people never notice a bug in iWork or iLife. But supporting mac users over 10 years, I have disproportionate issues with bugs manifesting themselves while running consumer code on server os. When some haxie installs an old version of mysql and changes your path, life sucks in server land. With server you have so much more control to alter user folder locations and poorly written software breaks there more readily than in a one admin user on one client standard os. If server were the same as client, why does it exist? I do appreciate the comments. More please!I honestly don't see why not. Functionally speaking, the phone is the same.Perfectly makes a lot of assumptions. Adding a device that isn't ready for a 64 bit kernel is what causes most people to avoid this setup. Currently the added cost and time to learn server seems a waste for a startup with no IT experience when solutions proposed (google, openVPN and such) work hosted for free or cheaply on the client os.Sorry - most of this is still general but less useful for your case. Great question and edit to make it razor sharp and specific.The timings on SSD are truly variable. You can spend from $150 to $2000 presently for SSD with varying speed and capacities. Your hibernation image is the size of ram so if you reduce ram the mac will wake from hibernation faster but be slower when ram is overcommitted.You will get no definitive answer because this depends on how much you modify/customize the OS, and you can modify a rooted OS enough to break anything and everything, or so little that nothing seems different.Wake from hibernate will be nearly equal to the benchmark speed for large block sequential read multiplied by the size of the ram image on disk as a worst case. So most SSD benchmark between 4x and 10x faster than spinning HDDThanks for your answer. I installed Git in /usr/local/git/bin and I allready tried to add it to my path. Now I can only use the cd command. ls, git ... commands don't work anymore.I know, @koiyu, but that's not what I asked. Thanks anywaythe mouse hack is ok, but my question was just out of lazyness. I prefer the hassle of pressing `command` than installing a software that will be running there for no really useful purpose. Thanks anyway!Even if you don't want to use the installer, you may still consider using a package manager like homebrew, which will certainly make installing, uninstalling, and updating much, much easier: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrewFor the programs, you will be having the dmg. Backup the dmg instead of programsIt is not clear why you'd want to backup the program. Do you want to backup your current settings as well? How is speeding up OS X connected to that?So backup dmg along with related files in the apps folder is best suggested? Is there also a best complete uninstall program to use or the mac default is sufficient? My speeding up mac is a side note question, just good to have a fast mac in working with. In choosing a free backup program, are there best preferences or suggestions? Carbon copy cleaner, time machine?thanks for your answers. But the installler/package manager part of my question is not my main concern.OK - that's an unusual place to install it - are you sure? Are you sure you didn't install it in: /usr/local/bin ? Have a check in the various directories to see where it actually is. Then verify that it works by running it with a full path: e.g.

/usr/local/bin/git   OR
/usr/local/git/bin/git   OR
/usr/bin/git

etc.

Once you have the correct path and you know it works, modify your PATH variable to be the 'directory' where the git executable lives.I'm not using the American keyboard -- I think autocorrect behavior is very different depending on the keyboard you're using.  Typing is fine: my keys are twice as wide as the QWERTY keys (which is good, because I'm completely unable to use that!).I'm using the Rock Band 3 Wireless Keyboard. I added a little blurb about it into the question. Though I think your MIDI->USB convertor will be good enough.I am sure it is the rigth directory. The git file located in this directory, when launched, list the most common git commands. In PATH I have /usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/git/bin .My problem is I can't use any terminal commands except cd ,-(@bmike First do notice that it was me the one who suggested to use alternatives, and second, OS X 'server' kernel is the same kernel as regular OS X, except it only comes in 64 bits. OS X server will run perfectly on that machine for any use, but more importantly, the use that the user is mentioning, he's going to do development and image editing, none of the presumably required tools will have problems with 64 bit kernels. I still insist your response spreads a false misconception. 64 bit kernels work fine these days, sans an occasional inexistent driver.Yep, it will work with any of the methods I suggested. You just need a MIDI cable and any of the the MIDI to USB converter suggestions above, the USB to MIDI connector being the cheapest.Thanks for the tip.No you can't. Yes you can make music, all that you want, but you can't repackage a sound or audio sample as is. (Which a *good drum sample* is)You make very good points, but why insist on "run perfectly for any use"? I haven't found ANYTHING since mid 1970's that runs perfectly for any use. No OS, no computer, that's just crazy talk. I think you are over reacting to my words of caution. I'm not against people trying server - just go in with some knowledge of what issues will bite you if you do it long enough. Hopefully lion will force 64 bit kernel solutions to prosper widely, but despite great progress, we're not there yet.I stand corrected - I went looking for the link after my first post and didn't reread it all.@bmike I believe you're not reading my answer they way I intended it. I didn't say that OS X runs perfectly for any use in my reply; if you put it that way it looks out of context and of course nothing works perfectly for any use, but assuming OSX is enough for this user in particular, the OSX Server is going to be exactly enough for the very same user (given what he said he was going to use). I insist that he shouldn't have a local server unless his business is really tied to that, after so many years I came to the conclusion that outsourcing things is the best route in a lot of cases.On the other hand, I don't know if Apple has any means to "notice" that ;)@RadekS: Yes, you can remove it, but future updates of iTunes may bring it back, so keep an eye on it.If you're going to do 3D stuff (Gaming, CAD, etc.) you want the fastest available card, especially on a system that won't allow you to upgrade it. That machine is going to be with you for the next 2++ years (my Mac Pro is from 2008 but I have upgraded the video card, an iMac owner can't). So unless you plan on upgrading the whole machine in a couple of years or you don't care about graphics, I suggest you go for the high end, if you can afford it.OK well that's probably because you've messed up your PATH. Some of the basic commands are built-in to the shell so don't rely on a PATH. One of the commands you've used has obliterated your shell path. Edit the contents of .profile and fix that. If you want help try posting the contents of this command: /usr/bin/grep PATH .*I suppose I was remember the Intel integrated graphics chips of ten years ago. Seeing the M made me jump.I am a multimedia guy (final cut pro, illustrator, aperture, lightroom, photoshop, Garage band, reason), software developer (visual studio, xcode) and die hard HD movie freak.tnx, i thought it wouldn't be possible either, but i just had to ask :)Good times back then - huh. The gratuitous graphics horsepower on my iPhone 4 puts most computers 8+ years old to shame :-)No problem. If my answer (or another answer) solved your problem you can mark it "accepted" by clicking the check mark.Can it be removed like any other app? By drag 'n' dropping it off the dock?That are not the mobile versionThe OS uses an algorithm to try to guess what you think you are touching based on the size, shape, and location of the touch. You can use the free Touch Train app to practice hitting a specific point.Make the speeding up a separate question and remove it here, please.Pandora is US-only (I forgot to mention I'm in France), Sirius XM seems to be a radio service (so no on-demand songs), and as for YouTube, it still requires the iPhone's screen to be left on(which could result in unwanted skips when left in the pocket). Thanks for the input tho :)didn't know it was US-only, or I wouldn't have suggested it :)Apparently you can get apps for the iPhone, Blackberry and hopefully soon the Droid...@Nathan Thanks for pointing that out.  It was free up until version 2.  (1.2 is still available for free on Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/)  I've corrected my answer.@bitbonk An SSD wouldn't make as significant a difference in waking from hibernation compared to a cold boot, but it will still be faster.I guess that just becouse i don't like using somg the wrong way...Apple build it and they want it to be jailbreak free. But that's stupid me... :-)Hardly. While Apple may have good reasons for disallowing access to the OS, it doesn't make you stupid.Saved again several GB thanks to it this week. Don't just run it once but do it from time to time. Also, I had to use the beta version on my SnowLeopard MBP. The one proposed by default just crashes at launch.Yah, pretty sure it hasn't been updated in a while except that beta to run on newer machines.If you're comfortable with the command line/terminal, `du -hs *` will get you far.  Even better, the same command will work on just about any *nix system.I found at [Tom's Hadrware](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-6970m-mobility-radeon-eurocom-panther,2847-3.html) again that 6970m is little less powerful than a 6850. I also found on different board that 6770m is little less powerful than a 6670. So can make your own compare from [Tom's Hardware Radeon 2011 page](http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/2011-gaming-graphics-charts/2D-Noise,Marque_fbrandx32,2679.html)This did the trick for me! I may register eventually.The git .dmg install does put git in /usr/local/bin/git so it is the normal place and not a problem- but as noted show us what your .profile/ full PATH  isI use a MiniDisplayPort -> VGA adapter at 1080 without trouble. Does the PC you tested with use the VGA connection?I didn't mean that i am stupid becouse of that, that i was saying is that "stupid me" for not wanting like every one else to jailbreak my iphone. becouse i belive, as you said, that apple have good reasons for disallowing access. :-)We're starting to see some more clarification. The new iMacs come with the Intel Z68 chipset, http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/05/04/apples_new_thunderbolt_imacs_include_unreleased_intel_z68_chipset.html. Wikipedia says they have 2 6Gb/s ports and 4 3Gb/s ports. Hope there's more clarification how to use the 6Gb/s ports.Not that I'm aware of, no. However, if you have a full size keyboard, there's a second `Fn` key to the right of the `Delete` key which can be used in place of the `Command+Fn` combination.hm got Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:is you're linux ssh server setup to forward X11 packets?see edit, make sure X11 is installed on your mac tooits installed and enabled. Just another bit of diagnostic help when i echo display i get a blank linewhen I echo $DISPLAY, it says localhost:10.0@politicus If `/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/git/bin`is the only thing in your PATH then you probably manually changed your path and removed everything that was on there before. You were supposed to APPEND `/usr/local/git/bin` to your PATH if it wasn't already there. Terminal `commands` are really just tiny programs and bash needs to know where to locate those programs so it uses your PATH.This is such a good feature. I remember when I first got my Mac and I was like, FINALLY scrolling that makes sense. Especially when you have dual screens and you don't want to have to click to activate a window just to scroll down a couple ticks.You just blew my mind. There have been times where I wished something like that opiton-drag thing worked but I figured no one would ever implement it. Now I need to remember what I would use this for :)Thanks you styfle for the explanation. I've found a solution >> edited my question.Thanks for the insights! Have you had any troubles with the vibration/noise in the 7200rpm disk?thanks for the answer!Mac OS error -1407 (errFSNotAFolder): Expected a folder, got a file.
Try dragging a blank folder into the trash bin and see what happensNo, it came installed like that from the factory and it runs very quietly.  With zero vibrations.Try logging out then in again. I've had this happen to me once when a process took ownership of the ~/trashNot really an answer, but I know that VMWare Fusion can catch the F-keystrokes before the host OS in single window / fullscreen mode ([not in the unity mode, though](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11656/how-to-send-keyboard-combination-that-is-global-shortcut-in-os-x-to-virtual-mac)).With Apple's X11 the $DISPLAY value is a socket not localhost@Randolph, many thanks. I wasn't aware of that. That is so much better. You should convert that to an answer so I can mark it.Thats what I got when I SSH'ed into the linux box.  On my mac I just get a blank like like @Jacopo.   But gEdit runs and other apps run perfectlyGlad you got it working - but just a note on the PATH you've got above, you've gotten the same directory listed in the PATH three times - it will work, but it is only needed once. To explain, what the PATH variable does - when you type a command in terminal - each directory listed in the PATH is searched in order for the command you ran. Each directory is separated by colon character. A handy tip too - before you edit any system file, you can make a quick copy of it (cp .profile .profile.bak) that way you can easily revert to a working version if something breaks.@Austin - I would expect cold boot with an SSD to be in the order of 20-30 seconds. I'd expect wake from hibernation to be less than 5 seconds.$1100? Then it better to buy a whole new Mac :)I called Apple Support, and the dude said that he couldn't help me because I have no warranty anymore, or I had to pay 49 EUR. Well if I pay 49 EUR they'd probably say I need to send my Mac to them and they repair it. This'll be a new MacBook then.Do you have syslog configured (/etc/syslog.conf) to accept debug entries?same old question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22469/whats-a-good-machine-for-iphone-developmentYou could set up Gmail as IMAP before iOS 4.Yes, but before iOS 4 setup **defaulted** to POP3 and you had to manually input server names etc for IMAP.I agree, I went the same way and there are no problems with noise or vibration.This is especially useful for non-webkit based browsers for uploading files.Why the Zoom is a great feature, it's not a solution to use the iPod.+1 for lovely suggestions - specially the ultimate "I give up my fingers" one: get a stylus. lol'able and valid. :)os x has drivers.Nice. I didn't even consider `textutil`. I've added your command to my bash aliases and am passing the filename as an arg. Also, for others reading who may not like CLI, I also forgot about right-clicking and selecting "Open With" TextEdit, which has a much smaller footprint than Office.I've not used this, but the question interested me and I came across something called steermouse, which you can use to assign key presses to the various buttons on your mouse - so depending what mouse you have, it might be a solution for you. http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/If you have a Magic Mouse, you can also scroll horizontally by swiping one finger left and right.Why do your tabbar items and windows look so, different?@Danny Staple same for laptops and wired aluminum keyboards.I know this is an older post, but this is a great answer! I changed the permissions on /system/library/launchdaemons/com.apple.mdnsresponder to try a fix that Apple recommended, but I would get the error mentioned above when trying to load it afterwards. Changing the owner and permissions as described above was the only way to get my internet connection back. Thanks!Or just create another two lines (or anu other object) with the same color as the background and place them at the beginning and end of the to be animated line (up to the edge) (instead of making a screenshot). Might also not work in any case, but is probably a bit easier to do (also considering other changes that might be done to the slide).This happened again! It's not that...Yup, restore as new http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4137 is the only option to permanently clear the sms or email cache at the moment.it is jailbroken, and is an ipod touch.So a **phone** will not ring if I'm using the internet, why doesn't it disconnect from the internet and ring, giving the suer the option?From my understanding, for these protocols the internet communication literally blocks the phone connection from being made, so it is not aware of such a connection. It could be in software they could detect you not sending packets and check if you're getting calls, but it doesn't if that is even possible.If it has an ssh server on it, it is just ssh root@ipaddress and when it prompts you for a password, it's alpine.i know that, but mac mounts ipod somewhere in filesystem, my question is where is the mount location?it depends on what application you are using to open it, or the serial COM port you are plugging it into.@Felix That works, too, unless you have a pattern or image as background.Can't the O2 servers (which record voicemail etc) notify the phone over the internet? The solution here is VOIP.If it is an ipod touch, just connect it to wifi and ssh into it is a lot easier than mounting it via usb.Not in the current implementation they cant. VOIP has its own pitfalls, like built in notifications for phone calls while you are in other apps.The iphone does have notifications for VOIP.?Aha! Thanks!  Now I feel like an idiot. :)What hobs is suggesting is to open Cydia, and install the [OpenSSH](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/openssh) package, then use that to connect to your iPod Touch: [Cydia Provided Instructions](http://cydia.saurik.com/openssh.html).FWIW, the supposed dupe is absolutely not an exact duplicate. This question is about disabling the write cache so that the the device can be safely removed; the other is about simply turning off the message and ignoring the risk.@barryj If you're referring to my time measurements in my original answer, I'm sure that would be the case on a brand-new quad-core iMac, but my measurements were made on a two-year-old MBP which was already bogged down with a lot of start-up "stuff".  If you're referring to my comment above, I was referring to the smaller difference in wake-from-hibernation times between a traditional HDD vs an SSD -- not the difference between an SSD cold boot and an SSD wake-from-hibernation.  Hope that clears it up.Do you mean an FLV (Flash video) file?  That's the format you'll find in common use all over the web (e.g. YouTube).  An SWF file is typically the "player" window, and not the video itself.  Most free video conversion apps today can handle FLV files.do I have to use the "Copy" photos in the photo booth app in order for them to sync with iTunes?@Asher No, the "Copy" command doesn't really help you there.  If you're looking for help with photo syncing, try creating a new question.  That will help people in the future who are searching for the answer to your same question.  :]This might be too "Unix-y" and technical for Ask Different.  If you don't get a timely answer here, you may have more luck over at Super User (http://superuser.com/).The backup part should also be made a separate question.Oh yeah, I remember seeing this before. I'll back things up try that.Resetting the PRAM took care of this on my iMac G5, not sure if it'll help an Intel mac.Ta. I'll try that.I looked this up, it's still advice Apple tells people. Will make it an answer.If anyone can replace these links with any Apple documentation that's more official, please feel free to do so; forum posts sometimes go away in a few years.Have you looked into BetterTouchTool? This might support it.Thanks; that's really strange, but I'll try it.I agree with this; while it sounds like something is physically broken, there's a chance it's not, and this is unlikely to hurt.You can also command-click to move a window without giving it focus.Works on 10.6 for me.Will try the Coolpad first, thanks. I'm mostly interested in getting some warning; think, "time for a coffee break, the fans will be coming on! Damn this heat!"I'm using fairly directional mics for vocals, but I prefer using omnidirectional mics for acoustic instruments, they get the sound of the room quite well. (Even better is using one of both when possible.)@Neil Fein  Good choice.  A nice side effect is that it will no longer feel uncomfortably warm to use your MBP on your lap.  The tilt height of the CoolPads is adjustable, but it doesn't have a significant impact on how well it cools the laptop -- so just set it to an angle that is comfortable for viewing and typing.That's quite awesome!@Neil Fein Ah, okay -- if you're using them for music recording, I'm sure you'll know what mic setup is best for your situation.  :]  Sorry that the fans are troubling you!It accepts debug entries from the kernal.@Austin; didn't mean to be snobbish, sorry. (Then again, we're Mac users!) :)@Neil Fein Didn't take it that way at all, no worries.  (But I totally know what you mean about feeling a bit "snobbish" in general as a Mac user.)  ;]Sorry to say, this didn't solve my problem.That's a bummer. Which fan is it? Anyone could take your serial number into an Apple Retail store and ask the genius bar for a parts and labor / non binding estimate for the repair. Then you could check in the Netherlands for alternate computer repair services armed with the part number. Apple often is the best bet as they work on the most macs, but surely some shops there are capable of getting in the iMac. It's way harder than almost any PC repair so the corner upgrade shop might be your last choice, but you're not out of options. I'd guess the US cost would be $50 to $120 for fan+labor.would snow leopard cd do the job or do I need osx?Do you recall this time what happened?@Neil Fein I'm sorry to hear that.  This was one problem that had me frustrated for months before I finally fixed it.  There are just too many variables to troubleshoot it easily.  Hopefully someone else here can come to your aid.It might help to know more detail about the "dropouts".  How long are they, and how often do they occur?  If you reboot your computer and start nothing but iTunes, does it still happen?  (If so, that would pretty much rule out computer performance and AirPort traffic issues.)Also, try running Airfoil (free demo): http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/  It can connect and stream music to your Airport Express from any app.  Try it with audio from various apps on your computer (e.g. iTunes, web browser, perhaps another media player like VLC) and let us know the results.+1 I did a lot of research when I was about to buy a battery extender and ended up going with Mophie.  It works great!Are you sure the swf is a video file and not some custom flash animation? If it isnt you could try something along the lines of http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/309773-Extracting-video-from-SWFI annotated a screenshot and then I tried to save it. Save thing happened.Does it happen every time you try it or just at random?Awesome news, thanks :)We get network dropouts from time to time, this may be just another symptom. Oddly enough, I think they happen more often when the weather's warmer, leading me to believe it's a hardware issue somewhere along the line.The EQ solution might well help somebody else. I've reset my Airport Express to join the network; I'll give it a day and see if it helps any, then report back.@Austin - Rebooting iTunes doesn't help, neither does rebooting the Airport Express. The dropouts are short gaps in audio, maybe a second long. I think the audio keeps playing while it's silent, not sure. (Also see the comments on [your answer below](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13518/airtunes-is-giving-me-dropouts/13520#13520).)I have done as requested :-)I'd advise against stopping the fan completely, but it may be worth the effort to blow the dust out of the fan with (low-power) compressed air. You can even hold the fan blades still while blowing it out so as not to kill the bearings. That can help.Airfoil - Gonna try that, but for other reasons; I can mix audio to multiple speakers that way without unhooking my Firewire audio interface.I said the same thing :). My solution is not a good idea in anything more than the short term, but the point was more to offer a suggestion of where to look for the noise.Sure, I'm not disagreeing with you. Just adding the bit about blowing the dust out. I can see where my comment might have been misinterpreted.iStat menus might be helpful as well. Got that running right now. When I hear the fans, I'll take a look at the temperatures so I'll know to keep things cooler than that temperature.When they need to :P@nix - But, how does the little guy in a black turtleneck inside my Macbook *know*? :)He starts to sweatI've heard of ASL, but I forgot to mention that for the purpose of the class I need to have my code be portable to Linux.@ughoavgfhw Mac users don't sweat. We take another sip of hot, black coffee on a hot, dry summer's eve. :DProbably had something ugly like SnowTunes installed http://cristomac24.deviantart.com/art/SnowTunes-iTunes-OS-X-theme-141310715 Cant rememberI've also been using `LOG_CONS` and `LOG_PERROR` to dump my syslogs to the terminal I am using (Xcode & Terminal).Then perhaps it's time for me to crack open Xcode and learn iOS DevI have been a mac user for my whole life, but I don't drink coffee so that's probably the difference. I'm assuming you haven't spilled coffee on your computer, so the man inside should start to sweat too.It seems to be at random. I think it's happened when I did a combination of crop and annotate, but I don't think it was consistent.Drag and drop on OS X is just amazing. Pretty much works everwhere."The answer isn't known" *is* a valid answer, even if it's not one I like. Ah, well!(+1 for your answer.) I've found the algorithm to be unsuitable for me, which is why I use `smcFanControl` and run the fans at a preset value on my iMac. Sure, the fans are always running now, but I can hardly hear them, and my temperature gauges look a lot healthier. This is antithesis to the OP's question, but I had to share it.Yes of course it does.+1 But don't forget the KISS principle -- you can get a portable DVD player for less than $60 these days (http://www.amazon.com/Coby-TFDVD7009-7-Inch-Portable-Player/dp/B0036R76R4/).  The primary downside is not having access to a digital media library, but it's cheap, easy, and you won't have to risk your $500+ iPad at all.This sounds like a bit of a convoluted situation that might benefit from App Store account support -- they are known to be very helpful: http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/contact.html?form=account&topic=Mac%20App%20Store%20Account%20and%20BillingThe community here may be able to suggest favorable alternatives to Flash depending on your needs -- perhaps you could be more specific as to what you'd like to run?Thanks, I have given NeO a rest for the time being. I do see how it is more "powerful" than e.g. Omnioutliner, but at the moment, I do not have the time to put into it. I am however using [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) and [Stapler](http://www.the-soulmen.com/stapler/). Tinderbox for organized notes and Stapler as a scratchpad.I dod not know about textutil, thanks for the tip!Before buying a new router - you should check that your current router has the latest software applied. I had a Netgear router previously that lost wifi connections regularly - once I applied latest software - it ran for months without issues.Thank you! I will give it a try. Can you provide a link to the update with more info? (I suppose I have to check for updates on my mac to download it automatically, but no updates are found).Considering that my objective is to not have the fans running while recording (to cut down on room noise in a studio), running the fans before a take using a fan controller program to pre-cool the Mac might be an option.@Bob - 2 things: 1) Snow Leopard is OS X; and 2) Snow Leopard is a DVD not a CD. But assuming you have a SL DVD, you can make a number of different partition types including Mac 'native' ones and Windows 'native' ones (e.g. FAT32). I wouldn't advise installing Windows on a FAT32 partition though. It's an outdated file system with many disadvantages. Rather, I'd install Windows on an NTFS partition. You can make this partition with `GParted` mentioned above, or with a Windows install DVD once you resized your OS X partition to make room. *This* (i.e. resizing) can be done with the SL DVD.I'm not sure my stats agree with this. As can be seen from the screen grab I have added, my usage is very high and I only recently had to restore from backup because the 4.3.2 update locked up my iPhone. Thanks for the App suggestions, I'll take a look. I'm currently considering jailbreak atm.Thanks for your answer but I want to use only the  mouse and to be able to switch in 1 click or 1 move.Please bear in mind that we generally don't talk about "future" things because I may say now: "No it's not possible at the moment" and the next developer's preview changes that, rendering this question (and its answers) kind of useless for new users looking for clues about how to disable or enable the aforementioned feature. In any case, there's no setting so far that allows you to disable this feature and/or an in-app setting to override it. (Developer's Preview 2).I think the void warranty point is incorrect as you can simply restore the official Apple version of iOS before requesting any repair. As long as you haven't unlocked there is no way (I think!) for Apple to detect that the phone was ever jailbroken.is there any difference in the network setups between the two computers? dns settings maybe?if you installed 10.6.7 via software update, you may want to try downloading the combo update from Apple and apply that. This is a larger download as it contains all updates from 10.6.0 onwards, but it sometimes seems to work better than the differential updates in the software update process.Many thanks. It's good to know I have this option at least when connected to ext monitor/keyboard.Many thanks, that option was not set.+1 for the question, I also noticed that the MAS was a lot slower+1 @barryj - The [Update Combo](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1361), although over 1 GB in size now, is worth trying. It's the only way I ever update point releases these days as the auto-update program does have a tendency to muck things up I've found. You won't do any harm, and you may fix your problem, by applying the Update Combo.You can use iStat Pro (http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatpro/) to check individual fan speed and see if the problem is localizedAlso, reapplying 10.6.7 using the Combo Update, and reinstalling XCode might help.Here is one http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1382 
and another http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1381 

Apply both if you have the latest Macbook ProIs the "sync apps" option checked?No (when I asked this I had no apps showing in iTunes and I got the message in my comment below). Now I have apps and I still ge the message I posted below.Hey Austin, I am thinking about different use cases. The first would be to use the IPad as a dedicated device for social media activities (like facebook, twitter, and so on) and would love to use it to publish messages really quick.

In the end I guess that a dedicated bluetooth keyboard would be the best solution, but right now I am just curious what can be done :)Thats what I tried to do with the procedure I described in the question. It worked for authorising my music store purchases, but it did nothing to the apps - didn't copy them across or anything. Plus, I think that could result in me loosing my save data from the Apps.@Shevek that's true, maybe I misread a guideline there. I'll check.Hi RobZolkos. They are both on the same network, behind the same router. I'm using Google's DNS on both, but I've tried without it as well.I wanted to add a comment to the other part of your comment - You will have a local copy of your messages. IMAP in Mail.app will store your messages offline too (they are in ~/Library/Mail/ and then your servername. If you switched to rules on the gmail side, you not only would have everything where you want it, but a local mirror as well. Plus would get them on all devices, versus your mac storing them locally that your iPhone can't get toYes I saw that, thanks anyway.That does help a little, but they display in the same window as code. I used to be able to scroll up and down comparing quickly, while also being able to look at my code. And I've had problems with some of the old logs loading. They'll just sit there with a spinner and a blank window indefinitely.Terminal uses a minuscule amount of RAM. If it's doing otherwise there's something wrong with your system. Right now it's using less than: a) a single Google Chrome tab, b) Skype, c) Adium, d) Finder. You may want to look at [Visor](http://visor.binaryage.com/) to see if it suits your needs.@Shevek stil couldn't find any relevant info without an app! :(+1 for the first video :pIs there a specific tool I need to use? I've been on the googles and found this quote: "NOTE: Those of you who rely on a carrier unlock MUST STAY AWAY from Redsn0w and stock iOS 4.3.3 firmware." (http://www.redmondpie.com/jailbreak-4.3.3-ios-iphone-4-3gs-ipad-ipod-touch-4g-3g-using-redsn0w-how-to-tutorial/)+1 for the same video I was going to link if no one else did.That would be perfect. Unfortunately, when the fans turn on is a bit of an open question; see [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13539/when-do-the-macbook-pro-fans-turn-on/13542#13542) for more information on why. Will be noting the internal temperatures when the fans go on in the future, with an eye towards either writing this sort of script or just being look at the sensor temperatures and know what "too hot" means.+1 because I love Alfred.@Austin - Can the coolpad's pivot function be disabled? It looks perfect otherwise. (I can't risk Firewire or USB being accidentally disconnected in the middle of a session.)Good idea; I'd forgot to mention that. For my router, it was already on the latest firmware, and since it was a b/g device and I wanted to have N speeds for the Mac, I figured it was time to upgrade anyway.They are certainly not identical. Server shares many of the same code and components, but the install deploys them in different configurations and server is far more complex than client version. You can choose to minimize these changes as a server admin, but server opens a whole world of hurt if you set up DNS, DirectoryServices, User Account Management and location, software updates (and probably 15 more major subsytems) improperly. Greater power cuts both ways and has to be used with proper knowledge. Minute differences in a plist can produce radically different end results.And I've never been refused or asked to pay for an exchange in warranty by Apple if light cleaning doesn't drastically make the action better.troublesome, but so cool! :)+1 for DTerm. A lot of people don't know about it, yet it works so well. Also note it is in the Mac App Store http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dterm/id415520058?mt=12Great ! From Snippets blog it looks like the guy selling Code Box just "stole" the ideas from Snippets... (http://www.snippetsapp.com/blog/snippets-whats-happening.html). I'll test Snippets, at least for 30 days then.Good question, but I don't see the need for the first warning sentence...Good point; I'm not an American and I tend to forget about that court decision. I've deleted my earlier answer.Is there a reason why you need to use wake on LAN to access it?@Neil I suppose you could easily put a dab of super glue between the two layers to stop the pivoting -- but if your computer is on a relatively flat surface it won't pivot unless you turn it (there is a decent amount of friction).  Plus, I'm pretty sure it would take a bit more force than your computer pivoting a bit to pull Firewire or USB cables free, especially since the force would be applied somewhat tangentially.+1 HandBrake is great.and [now it's back to "not ok" again](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13529/dragging-songs-straight-from-windows-explorer-onto-my-iphone-stuffs-it-up), right? I have no idea what that issue is, but it'd be **better if you had edited this question** rather than creating a new one. You still can do that and delete or *ask to close the other one*, if you will, even if there are so many comments there right now. Well, I dunno. Just wanted to let you know the proper way for next times! ;)Firewire cables don't need to be pulled free to break the connection, unfortunately. And FW audio interfaces aren't  hot-pluggable. :(Re-installing the Java 10.6 Update 4 did indeed help. Thank you very much!I'd point out that that ruling only applies in the US. Any international users who read this would be advised to consult their own lawyers first about the legality.@Neil I just tested mine, and it turns out it won't pivot at all on its own, even on a steep surface.  I can reach the point where the computer starts sliding off before the pad pivots.  If your cables are so short that they pull on the laptop it might swivel a little, but that would actually serve to reduce the strain on the connections.@Gregory Understood -- it's always fun to push the boundaries of our gadgets!  :]Interesting thing is after I ran time machine to create a full backup iPhoto is now fast again. Totally bizarre.By 'take the screen shot' do you mean via software such as the built-in mac screenshot, or with a camera? Changing the profile will only have an effect if you are physically taking a picture of your monitor with a camera.Please clarify what "offical" means to you. I'll assume you mean a commercially available and supported product.@Shevek that means people who are locked to a carrier and use jailbreak to *unlock their carrier lock*. In your case, you're not locked to a carrier. But I don't think the *official carrier unlock* is **only** at carrier level, though I agree jailbreak certainly will **not** affect your unlock.taking a screen shot with an app, either built in screenshot or skitch or similar.so changing the profile will have no effect on your screenshot. If you want to test - take a screenshot, then change the profile, and take another of the same screen image. Display the two results side by side - they'll be the same.@barryj, I wish that was the case, really I do. I wouldn't be asking this question if that was the case. The screen image being captured is *clearly* the "after correction for your display" pixels.I stand corrected - that seems a bit crazy to me. Sorry to have contradicted you.Perhaps this would work - supposedly removes colour profiles: http://imageoptim.pornel.net/nope, that removes an embedded profile, these screen shots don't have one.It's an old Powermac (G5) and it's quite loud even at idle. And i don't access it frequently as my Linux box to be always powered on.Thanks, will try it next weekAh, makes sense. Though if its at work, is the noise that much of a concern, when you would wake it up anyways with WoL?"Google It" is not an accepted answer on this network. It would be great if you could pick one you like (iFixIt perhaps?) and link explicitly to it.If you bank uses basic/digest authentication, stop using it... Chiefly because you don't know if they're using basic or digest authentication.hm, i feel like this question might be more applicable on serverfault,as it seems more and more like the issue is on the server sideWell, I was hoping there was an apple solution.  Failing that I will take whatever is normally used by the community.Apparently more than HandBreak is needed.  I ran it on my DVD and it was filled with all kinds of artifacts/noise and the audio was choppy.@Vaccano I don't have a lot of experience using HandBrake since I don't own DVDs, but a lot of people on the EiC forum swear by it. Maybe a tutorial will help? http://www.everythingicafe.com/forum/threads/tutorial-put-your-dvds-on-your-iphone-step-by-step-instructions.6047/What torrent client? - usually the issue is the router or ISPAlso note that using this method would mean you are sending your username and password in plaintext so anyone on your network could potentially see this. If you're not connected to your home wifi, then this is not a good idea.Thanks for your answer. Do you know if there is an app that will 'fullscreenify' apps until 10.7 is public?One of the reasons to love OSX :Ddoesn't include 4.3.3 yetso I can safely use either Redsn0w or Sn0wbreeze then?although if I select 4.3.2 it ends up at a Redsn0w page about 4.3.3!ah, the IMPORTANT FOR UNLOCKERS section on this page explains it quite well: http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=14563&laid=after you have done this you can enter or upload all of your Microsoft Exchange dataDon't give other people your mac and let them restart it.try sudo killall AppleVNCServer, it might workthank you. The "convert notes" feature lets me convert the notes to "real" skim notes, however to those which are displayed also only as a symbol on the page, so the **real content** of the notes is not displayed on the page and I still don't see how to print it (I also tried the snapshot feature). :-(I tried, no luck.  It respawns the process, but doesn't close the screen share.on the server have you configured SSH server to forward X11 packets?This worked like a champ!  Thanks :-)  I was worried about doing this with a file transfer in progress, but it was unaffected :-DI found an app called megazoomer (http://ianhenderson.org/megazoomer.html) but have never used it. It does say it should support Snow Leopard too. 10.7 is supposed to be out this summer at some point.Great - that last comment works, but not via remote desktop for some reason. Thankyou!You're right -- I had to create a custom rule to handle files with blank extensions...but it seems to have worked -- thanks!  The only downside is that it's $13.  I have no problem paying for good apps, but that's a bit steep considering I'm looking for just this one feature.I like that it's free, but there's no way to set a default app for files with no extension.  Using MIME types can approximate this somewhat, but then it changes the default app of all text files, not just those with no extension.  Thanks for the suggestion anyway -- perhaps it will help someone else.so there really isnt anyway to lock that as well?it is possible to lock securely, as long as your user account password is kept secret and that you never ever let people who you do not trust use your mac without your permissionRelated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4084769/ipad-and-arduino-integrationThanks for the info.  Hope its possible. Interesting about the Windows activationDo you think running Linux in a VM that looks at a web server in another VM is possible though?Yes it is possible. Each of the VM products have a variety of networking options, depending on your requirements, they can either just access the host machine or they can use bridge mode and be fully-fledged network members with their own IP address, on your real network.fyi, its vim version comes with janus ;)fyi, I switched from Terminal to iTerm2, which has a native visor like feature, and much much more like splitpanes! :)Great thanks Andy. Sounds like what I need, I will check it out.or change to a setup that works in Maildir.i like the question, but think it should be on super user.The first sentence is irrelevant, as far as I can tell. Setting it to "Every Space" still changes the Space when opening a new window via something like AppleScript or a keybinding, and the dock context menu  never changes the space regardless of this setting. The one interesting thing in this answer is the "When switching to an app, switch to space with open windows from that app" option. Disabling it "fixes" the keybinding/AppleScript case, but unfortunately "breaks" command-tab. If only OS-X had a proper "cycle windows" key binding that worked across all windows in all apps on all spaces.Is there a way to do this from the keyboard?Weird, because when I used the snapshot feature I got a pdf with notes on page if they were skim notes, I can see the garish yellow boxes everywhere. As it is supposed to print out essentially a screenshot of the content(and you can see the notes in the screenshot)Starting after `ssh-add -D`, what sequence of commands causes the keys to be added? `ssh somwhere` by itself should not add keys. A newly started agent does add keys that have passphrases stored in a keychain and *launchd* will start an agent automatically whenever an SSH command tries to use the advertised agent socket. However, such automatically added keys are immune to the default lifetime `-t` (due to a bug?), so if adding `-t` is effective, then your keys are being added in some other way (`ssh-add` in a shell startup script or some commonly run script?).There are always methods to access your data once you have physical access to computerI actually configured it not to copy media to its local libraryThen it sounds like it is a sort by date added and shift click to delete. iTunes is assumes you will want huge share on your local hard drive and no music would ever want to move around :>but my password doesnt matter because you do obviously dont have to have one for them to restart my computer and type in the commandsActually, I'd recommend using `cd "$1"` instead.  `$@` expands to the list of all arguments passed to the script, and if there's more than one `cd` will just gripe that it can't go more than one place; `$1` expands to the first argument, so if you manage to pass it more than one it'll just go with the first.  Also, make sure you use double-quotes around it, to keep the shell from getting confused by funny characters (like spaces) in the folder path.I hadn't appreciated that the LCD panel itself is under a piece of glass! Excellent point.Thanks, have ordered it from OWC. Will report back how it does in the studio this summer.Are you saying that you sync'd your iPad, upgraded the iOS version, and then found that all the free apps you had downloaded were deleted from your iTunes App library (and by extension, your iPad)?By "symbols" I presume you mean desktop icons?

Does the microphone work in other applications?Restarting does not help. Therefore logging off and back in does not work either.Does not help :(Using two accounts sounds interesting, but I may be able to sync two accounts at the same time for my devices?

If you used a "hack-y" method, you may just have removed the icon resource and not told OS X to release the space that it reserves for it.+1 Using a third-party driver currently seems to be the only way to do this.Have you tried restarting? Sometimes my computer has trouble finding the camera (although the microphone works), and I have always been able to get it back by restarting.The question is about an iPod touch, which doesn't have disk mode.

Went from having to wait literally minutes for the search field to respond to keyboard events to just a few seconds.  Also clearing google maps search 'recents' seemed to add additional improvement.Alright so I actually had great success. It turns out the issue was more geared towards MacDrive itself. The issue being it REQUIRES the small 200mb EFI partition to exist on a disc or else it won't let you read or write to the list. Apple's build in bootcamp drivers (installed onto a non-mac) machine has revealed the rewrite of the new partition actually is the correct one that has all my files accessible now. The new issue is that I need to be able to write, ergo, I need to use Macdrive, ergo, I need to restore the EFI partition. Any suggestions?That did not resolve my issue. Removing FaceTime altogether and restarting resulted in a "?" appearing in the Dock, and rebuilding LaunchServices did not do the trick either. The application isn't running when I boot, it's just been "Kept" in the Dock.This is very odd indeed. Sorry I couldn't help you.Nope, sorry :/ From my first read, it sounded like you had a more general disk data issue, thats all :PThe drive is 150gb large. Since I'm booting from the installation DVD, I don't have the option of opening the activity monitor.What doesn't work well enough with your current router that you are hoping to improve on?

Thank you :)the one i have is fine, but i was curious if there are any advantages of getting an apple router to match the computers. Similar to if you have a netgear router have better connectivity with netgear wireless cardsI think it depends on the kind of note: The notes were automatically converted to an **anchored** Skim note which is represented in the document only by a symbol and is displayed in a separate window@boehj I don't know what that means; possibly get into the Terminal?

I do try to remember to turn off the monitors when I leave, but often forget. I do have the monitors go to sleep when not in use, but with screen sharing, the screen saver never comes on as long as screen sharing is open.@Darryl Not to be mean, but I think correcting the "forgetting" to turn off the monitors is the easiest and best way to solve the problem of the monitors drawing power while you're away.  If I leave my home during a hot summer day and forget to turn down the air conditioning, then my forgetfulness is the reason for the waste of power.  You could plug them into outlet timers if it's really an issue.

Also, can you tell us exactly what you've selected in System Preferences-> Displays for the external monitor?Yes, I've tried that, but it still didn't work.

I'm not sure, I think I changed the rotation of the Samsung monitor in the System Preferences-> Displays when it was in 1920x1080 to 270, then it stopped working in that resolution.

I also tried reverting back to default rotation, but it still doesn't work.@radiodio Gotcha. Can you tell us exactly what the settings are that you're using now?@nathan

on the Samsung: Refresh Rate is 60hz; Resolution is 1920x1080.

edit:
I was able to fix it by deleting  com.apple.windowserver.plist and com.apple.preference.displays2.

Then switching on "Mirror Displays", lowering the resolution, turing off "Mirror Displays", than selecting 1920x1080 again.

I switched the connection from AirPort to Ethernet, flushed the DNS cache, and used ISP provided DNS instead of the Google DNS that I was using on both the systems. However, I could not notice any improvements (other than the mere few seconds). Naturally, if MAS was taking too long to load content, I should think that the Network Activity Indicator would keep spinning. But it disappears after a few seconds, and the mouse cursor turns into a spinning beach ball.Hi barryj. Thanks. Due to several constraints where I am, downloading anything that big (or bigger) from Apple (where resume isn't supported so well, if at all) is a big nightmare.

I don't want to argue with you about what should be here and what should not be but instead should allow any type of question that relates to apple devices and software.@bckbck What @Austin said is not that the question should *not* be here, but that he will get better luck on SuperUser. The reason (and I agree) is that as much as we (as an Apple community) may know about an iPhone, not a lot of users here have Windows experience (or enough Windows experience to come up with a solution). We *DO* allow these questions, only after a couple of days we suggest migrating over SU if the question warrants it. This is more a Windows problem (i'm sure if he tries his iPhone in a new Windows computer it will work).Although it *still* doesn't support drag-and-drop, which is incredibly frustrating. I usually end up using the now-unsupported VisualHub.Wow its strange that you have to set the mail timezone and it is different from the clock time zone but nevertheless thanks very much!@thelearner actually, I shorten the the title, it's "Mail, Contacts, Calendar". It has nothing to do with mails. Sorry for the confusion, I've updated my answer.To the point: "But GPL doesn't require your software to be installable by everyone who downloads it." I'm afraid that FSF complies with Windows **only** because its unthinkable to ditch it from OSS world. But iOS devices still are a minority that can be shed early on so that it won't build up. Add ZFS to this and you get why I tend to prefer BSD/MIT/Apache licenses over GPL.care to share a sshot of your dock as well?Thanks for the tip. I'll post there.@Mustafa You should avoid cross-posting -- ask a moderator to migrate it for you.I believe stackoverflow has more visibility than stackexchange. Duplicate won't hurt, it might just work for me.Just ran `./wkhtmltopdf *.html *.pdf` and it worked great, with an exception. It produced "*.pdf" file instead of separate files for each html. Do you know if this utility has the support to generate separate files? Thanks much.Hi Mustafa, try something like (in a directory of HTML files) `for f in *.html; do wkhtmltopdf $f "$f.pdf"; done` to loop through the files in a directory.With a little modification e.g. `for f in *.html; do ./wkhtmltopdf "$f" "$f.pdf"`, it works beautifully. Thanks much.Hm, i'm not that good with AppleScript :) In fact, i've recently only done Hello World like stuff in AppleScript.Oops, I didn't realise that they don't also provide the binaries for it onthere.Will not work with SWF, only with FLV.@Martin: http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps :)Ugh.  Yeah, I guess I might do that.  Seems kludgey.  But in Apple's defense, I think most software doesn't consider parental controls.  For example, Mozy complains unless I give the Mozy Status permission to my son.  He can't restore anything but it's not the way I wished it were.  Hey, would about simply making the apps hidden?  Is there a command to do that?I can do that.  But last night it asked me to reboot the computer.  My son likes to play with PhotoBooth so that means that every time he wants to change it, I've got to turn off parental control, reboot, set the wallpaper, turn on PC, CONFIGURE parental control again.  Granted, if this is the only way then my son will have to "suffer" with only the occasional wallpaper change.  But I wonder if there is a terminal command to set it (for Stretch to Fit, for example) and a folder to store the image.So I did go in with SSH. But my BSD-experience is limited, and BSD-handheld even more so :) So I didn't find out anything special.Tried several times. No genius bar available, and the phone is out of any warranties anyway.yeah I got what you meant, my only issue is why would I need to set the region for mail and then set the region for time - surely there should only be one setting - Apple weirdnessIt seems to depend on the model. My MacBook Pro will share the DVD drive over FWTDM, but my iBook G4 doesn't.Perhaps your looking for a [Lemon Parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Parser_Generator) (part of SQLite) or the LEMON C++ library: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEMON_(C%2B%2B_library) ?Do they automatically show up if it's supported? If so then it's not supported on my Power Mac G4.+1. Searching `"lemon Experience" Apple Mac OS` brings up the slang for a lot of things, not just Mac.Well - it's looking more like an account or local install database issue if it's locking up but either not hitting the store with the correct request or if the request from the store causes your MAS to spin. Testing malformed data is very hard - so if the XML files being processed are buggy, you could easily end up in loops. A real puzzler without being able to debug the payload.@chris-johnsen are you actually testing this on **Snow Leopard** ? SSH on SL acts differently from Leopard. I know that SL's ssh is adding my key to the ssh-agent because I tried this on a new Mac. I can clear the stored key with "ssh-add -D" afterward and then I get the passphrase dialog box again, but that's not an acceptable solution. Logging out will also clear the stored key (this behavior is consistent with quitting ssh-agent). The problem is reproducible. I'm not the only one: http://www.serverfault.cms-forex.info/details/144147/ssh-passphrase-remembered-in-macosx-snow-leopard/I've asked on SU and here on apple.stackexchange.com and there's no real answer to this. The best we can do is hope that this will be an option in 10.7There doesn't appear to be a command line helper like the overall software update so you may be limited to launching a script that will automate the GUI commands. Would you edit the question to clarify if you expect the "working" solution to be a terminal only or if an Automator script that will key in your password when asked is what you are looking for.@chris-johnsen I realize you're trying to be helpful, but please try to understand the details of the problem before laying out an entire step-by-step solution.here: http://imageshack.us/f/191/unled2u.png/@Daniel I updated y answer.Apple has built it's reputation by making it's products substantially better and not just incrementally better. I would speculate that either the bang/buck doesn't merit the small device or unannounced plans will make that small space less desirable in the near future. Great link on the Z68. Since apple underwrites many repairs for 3 years, new tech usually is tested thoroughly before it gets implemented to ensure user and shareholder satisfaction.+1 This is what you have to do first.They don't have a feed so you can subscribe to the podcasts via iTunes?@Joe I believe they do automatically show up (in my MacBook Pro's case, a DVD had to be in the drive).Is it causing a problem with the Dock? Sometimes log messages are just there for the developers.Unless you have your user account protected with FileVault using a file recovery utility will allow somebody to "undelete" your files.This is a huge gap in Word for the Mac, and it's an important issue to me as a freelance editor; I'm starting a bounty. Are there any parts of the question that are unclear that I could edit to make this more answerable?Nothing at all? Wow, that's a waste of a bounty. Maybe I should have asked this on the Apple site instead?I checked it out and I am not seeing any way to make this happen unless you had a crack at the source code. I checked the applescript dictionary and saw things relating to the word comments, but I am garbage at applescript, and best case you could hack something together to tell current position and show an overlay of comments in it. Quite hacky and beyond me frankly. Sorry!@hobs - Thanks for checking in any case. If there's any way to do this, I think it would have to be through some major coding. I suspect the answer may be that I have to live with the problem, or use OpenOffice and then export to Word. (Adding a step to the process isn't an appealing prospect.)This and bmike's answers are probably the correct answer, it's the general understanding of what it means to own/buy a lemon, I'm still very curious about the specific source(s) that caused the OP to ask the question.I wonder how many people will really buy it, considering you can get a Mac Mini for about the same price.sounds like a terrible idea, since SMS is limited to 160 characters and almost no e-mails are that short.@Mild huh? You mean you've cleaned the speaker output (which is right beside the Dock Adaptor), right?@TheLearner wait till you travel to another timezone, then you'll see weirdness... :P@user6331 then your question makes not much sense. You will **need to compromise on quality** if you want to save space and Handbrake can do that.You'll probably need to modify your router's NAT settings.  What brand/model of router do you have?I edited the question for clarity, but please do reject my edit or revert the edit if I've missed what you're trying to say.No, I mean I cleaned the adaptor. I adapted the answer to suit my problem, and came up trumps.Did you ever find the source? We're experiencing the same issue on our snow leopard server. I may try a reboot but I can't do that until later tonight.You might get a better audience over at http://superuser.com - it's more geared to ports and MySQL and yes, homebrew is a program to help port things to mac, but to MySql and the preference panel are general to all OS and not mac-specific.Any helpful error messages in the Console?  (`/Applications/Utilities/Console.app`)I agree that you might want to try this question over at SU.  Also, consider installing MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/) instead -- it's a "friendlier" way to get MySQL running on your Mac (along with Apache and PHP).It's not really clear what you've done and what you're trying to do.  Could you explain this in more detail for people who aren't familiar with "Tap ranch"?For some torrent clients it's a known fact that they will cause your 'net connection to time out. Google your torrent client name and something like 'killing outbound internet activity' and  you'll probably see a number of threads on it. I use uTorrent and it routinely kills my outbound connectivity until I shut it down.Yes. But boot times aren't that ($600) important since rebooting iMacs are rare. But my late-2011 MacBook Air (which has SSD) is *incredible* snappy and I wonder if an SSD-iMac would see the same improvement.I have a ZyXEL Q1000Z.Well, fixed the issue. Somehow it looks like my Airport Express connection kills it when I leave it on and then put my laptop to sleep. So if I just disable the WiFi then put it to sleep it works great the next time I logon and re-enable WiFi. Weird.@Austin I will not be using MAMP as I do not need apache and php. I just need MySQL.You could just think of it as "updating" Apache and PHP, since your Mac comes with both anyway.  You could be rocking a working MySQL installation in less than five minutes.  Up to you, though.For the unknown reason I can see only "Bundled Software" disk in the package and it didn't seem to contain xcode when I've tried to install.. So I've gone with the download solution. Anyways, thanks!wooooooooooow, you just introduced me to a new world :D I'll take a lool at it and let you know. Thanks!You're welcome!  You should also try repairing permissions (`/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app`, select your hard drive, and under the First Aid tab click "Repair Disk Permissions") on the off chance that helps with your problem.Congratulations, your comment made me realize a better answer.Do you object to jailbreaking on 4.3.3 instead of 4.3.2?I have not had it pop up since my reboot, (un)fortunately, so I still don't know the sourceshades work absolutely perfect, thanksFlux and nocturne don't do what I want, I don't want invertion I want a dimmer screen. Didn't mean to x-post, just found out about apple.stackexchange too late. Shades tho is perfection.@Johan You're welcome -- glad I could help!same thing happened to me. I just restored because I jailbroke.Seems like I was able to burn MP3's using iTunes as you suggested, although I couldn't figure out how to get the mp3's into a separate folder. Essentially, I just need to burn a "data" disc...nothing special, as long as mp3s are on the disc, perhaps in folders/directories, that's all I need.Thank you for your quick response! OK, so the display DOES respond to mouse movement. In fact, the computer responds to commands, and the Finder is loaded briefly, before everything fades away as if the operating system completely reloads/resets. Any ideas?Just tried it, didn't help. Other options?@penyuan When everything fades away and comes back, is the system in the same state it was before it started to fade (e.g. mouse cursor in the same position), or is it in a new "reset" state?(1) The mouse cursor is in the same position (2) during the few seconds before everything closes, I could click on a program in the dock and it would start loading (sometimes the window appears), but then everything (including Finder, Dock, menubar) would close again and the screen fades to a blue background (3) again during those few seconds, I tried to open system preferences, then the machine froze with a spinning grey wheel (the one you seen during boot) in the middle (the background including mouse is frozen).Since there is always the step of a non-jailbroken upgrade, I don't think there will ever be any method other than what you've described. Which is why I won't upgrade unless I really, really, really must have a feature in the new iOS that isn't already done via the jailbreak.Overwriting system components is usually a bad idea. There can be other applications depending on `/usr/bin/ruby` being the Apple supplied `ruby`.@penyuan You said that it fades if you click an icon in the Dock.  If you do *nothing*, does the fading problem still occur?  How often does it occur?  Does it happen at regular intervals (e.g. exactly every 10 seconds).  Also, please edit your question to add any of this relevant info to it so others who might want to help can benefit from it.  :]@Bavarious I think the chances of that are very slim for `ruby` on OS X (it would be different if we were talking about making a major change like PHP4 to PHP5).  But you're right that it's generally a Bad Idea, which is why I mentioned it last.  I presume there's a reason this user prefers 1.9.2 over 1.8.7 or they wouldn't be asking this question -- the potential benefits of running the latest version probably outweigh the tiny risk of breaking something because it was upgraded to the next minor version.Had you bothered to open Nocturne preferences, you would have seen the *Invert screen* checkbox, and quite a few others, right at the top. Leave only *Adjust screen brightness*, and it does what you want. Flux is actually more sophisticated, not doing brightness, but changing the perceived [color temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) of your screen.The included styles aren't great. I recommend a [a nicer looking one](http://john.albin.net/software/introducing-succinct-for-colloquy).Thanks. Looks good.I think I actually stopped using IRC purely because Colloquy looking so bad. Now I have that theme and I have got rid of some of the useless buttons (seriously, I dont need to change encoding that much) it is a joy to use.@Gordon In this case, with the "Allow Multiple Selection" checkbox unchecked, there will actually never be more than one argument passed to the shell script. Putting $@ in double quotes is indeed necessary (as I did in my original answer).Thanks, but this option is not available in the parental controlled accounts (especially a simple finder one).  Also, when I turn off simple finder and click Preferences (Allow Once) I get to this screen but none of the settings stick.  It reverts back to the Orion Nebula (or whatever that nebula is called).Wait, I haven't tried the Control Click!  I will try that one today.  ThanksNope.  Control click is not allowed for a managed account.  I will try the automater idea.  But I have to say this is pretty frustrating.  I understand not changing audio drivers for a managed account but not changing your desktop image?  Jeesh...I'd guess there isn't any and I'm surprised Meebo is that good.That has **never** worked out any good for me.Automater didn't work.  Nothing works.  Argh that is frustrating.  Maybe tonight I will post screen shots of every setting so people can see what I'm doing.  ThanksAdium is good on its own and IM+ is good on its own. There is no inter-compatibility though. There is no way to do what Trillian does, which is to open a chat with the one (let's say iOS) and have it running on the other as well (OSX). It's the single most important feature of Trillian for me.is there any video for this? Because I can't find any switch :(I don't have a link to a video right now without searching. And its not like an on/off switch. Its like a manual eject you always see on CD players. And on the slot loading drives, its usually always on the right.If I use Im+ they show up as a SMS with the blue window. and I just want that notification! I live in sweden so sms wont work, I have Telia and they aren't on your list there...iTunes used to burn MP3 CDs with folders (based on playlists, albums, whatever you selected), but that stopped in version 4 (I think) and now it's just a flat structure with all the songs on the root level.You might want to look into RVM - The Ruby Version Manager - it allows you to have multiple ruby versions installed along with specific gemsets for different projects. https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/@Austin thanks but no thanks.I've had this bug in Firefox (I don't use Chrome or Safari). I don't know what causes it, but for some reason clearing the cache fixes it for me.I will try your "AskPassGUI" solution when I'm at my SL machine. If it works I'll accept your answer. Also, I reverted /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist and put my modified copy in /Library/LaunchAgents/. My mod was loaded.@michaelmichael I tried and it didn't work :(Thanks for the reply. I already have that checked (the editor vendor had me try that).Automater works for me on 10.6 so it's not so much you don't know how to operate this functionality but that your software isn't working. Either your software has become corrupt or you have inadvertently locked this down further than a simple managed account. I tested the automator on two different macs - one 10.6.6 and one 10.6.7 - have you tried making a new account and testing or at least summarizing the details on how you have restricted this particular account. You're going to learn a bit about accounts before this is done ;-)Louis Gerbarg's excellent explanation of why SSD erases are not like traditional hard drives. http://www.devwhy.com/blog/2009/8/4/from-write-down-to-the-flash-chips.htmlare you certain the risk is "tiny"? Managing Ruby with RVM is so much easier and safer.+1 Using RVM to manage my Ruby installations and gemsets has changed my life. Whenever an incompatibility or conflict has cropped up, I'm back up and running in minutes.Damn it's repairing tons of file's permissions. Is this normal? do permissions get corrupted often?Nop never used custom styles for any browsers. And I checked if I disabled styles/js files but i didn't disabled them either.@Alvar Ah, here's the problem!  You've been saying you want "SMS", but then right here you say "SMS won't work" where you are.  The little "blue windows" are iPhone *notifications* -- SMS messages are only one of many things that can pop-up notifications.  If you use the wrong term, it's very confusing for the people who are trying to help you.  Please edit your question to better reflect what you're looking for.OK, how about adblock? Are you using some kind of adblock on those browsers? Just looked at your posted screenshot and it seams that google analytic was also blocked. Maybe you are using some system-wide network filtering that you've forgot that you have?You are absolutely right, just an old habit from MS DOS times:)I wouldn't say that they become corrupted "often", but it's certainly not uncommon.  I'm not at all surprised that you have a lot of corrupted permissions if you haven't repaired them in a year and a half.  Did it help with your problem?  If not, was there anything helpful in the Console?  And how much free space do you have on your hard drive?Hmm. I have had no such problems like this - I have the MacBook Pro 15" (Late 2008 Unibody edition) and previously a MacBook (White) (Mid-2007) and no problems of such sort appeared.@drfrogsplat That's exactly right! You should make that an answer. Also, keep in mind that almost all apps store data for themselves (content, highscores, whatever) which take up a bit of space, too.@ghoppe I say the risk is "tiny" because you're not likely to break any important, core system functionality on OS X by upgrading Ruby.  Could it cause some quirkiness in a small corner of your system somewhere that's hard to troubleshoot?  Maybe.  Ultimately, the main headache would probably be maintenance related if he plans to update Ruby frequently.  You're definitely right that RVM would be a good option, and much preferable to changing system files.+1 This would probably be a great option for you.This is off-topic and probably belongs over at Super User.  But Nathan is right -- you'll want to try the web page in a different browser.  It could also be that your email client broke the link somehow.VICTORY IS MINE!!! I'm currently in Vancouver for a conference; I walked into a local Bell store, and, after a bit of consultation with the store manager, I was able to get a microSIM ($5) which went into the iPad with only a bit of difficulty and let me sign up for Bell service. $15 for 250 MB or $35 for 5 GB (roughly comparable to domestic AT&T rates, I think). I'm running on it now; 2.5 MB/sec down, 375kb up.  Happy camper!Although I love RVM - this doesn't answer the question posed. The OP already has the ruby he wants compiled and seems intent on not using $PATH to let them coexist.This is better IMHO than replacing the binaries as the OP asks.@bmike Where does the OP voice that intent? I don't see it. I disagree with your interpretation of what it means to answer a question on StackExchange. Giving advice, presenting alternatives, and outlining best practices are valid answers as well if they address the asker's need, which in this case is to install the latest version of Ruby on Snow Leopard.+1 Good basic troubleshooting tips here.The answers below are correct. I _have_ heard it used to describe a mac. (Once, and only once). It is used to describe an unlucky experience where a switcher's first purchase is one of the rare cases that there are a lot of problems in a short time. The result is often that the user gets frustrated and switches back to Windows.Great, thanks for the answer.I've found out this setting doesn't apply here. When enabled it means keystrokes like Command-N will be given to X11 (new terminal, in this case) instead of to the application itself. In my case I certainly want Alt-key to go to the application, not X11, so I have turned off "Enable key equivalents under X11".Spotlight's default shortcut is Comand-Space and Undo is Command-Z. How are these colliding? What key are you hitting? In Dvorak, Spotlight should be the same as QWERTY and Undo should just be moved a little.Skype does this, but 1) it's awful, 2) doesn't support MSN :(@ CajunLuke the conflict I referred to was with spotlight's Comand-/The fact the mechanism wants to eject but can't points to hardware failure.I had seen these figures however I'm a little confused by 'Current Required'. My initial thinking was that this is some amount that the device has requested be available for it to function and not that it is the actual amount being consumed.I agree RVM is the best way to maintain a non standard ruby. But unless the question gets edited (which hopefully will happen to make the question more usefully match your great answer) I don't see how "use RVM" best answers the question "how do I replace /usr/bin/ruby at 1.8.7 with /usr/local/bin/ruby at 1.9.2?" What if the OP has scripts hard coded to call /usr/bin/ruby? Does RVM step in there to assist?Do you really need to replace /usr/bin/ruby or are you open to alternatives like RVM or modifying the $PATH variable?Usually it's a memory allocation bug. What jailbreak did you use? Perhaps others have the same issue? If not, you might wipe your device and start over since the data structures are getting hosed in what appears to be a systematic way.Not sure about all applications, but with MacVim specifically you can add this to your `~/.vimrc`: `set guioptions-=T`vim or emacs coupled with Transmit meet all the requirements you have enumerated. I wouldn't call either the ultimate IDE but both meet the stated requirements.@slackwear According to Apple (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049): `The Current Required (mA) entry indicates the current the device needs to operate.`  So I would presume that most devices, when turned on and in use, would consume that much current.  Do you need the *exact* amount being drawn by a specific device at any given moment?  Or are you just trying to get an overall estimate of how much power your USB devices are drawing together?It looks like this has already been answered over at Super User: http://superuser.com/questions/143703/is-it-possible-to-somehow-hide-growl-and-herald-when-vlc-runs-fullscreenYes - the acceleration curve is not available directly to the user.Looks like a system font problem to me.  Has it always been this way on your Mac?  I presume you have tried restarting your computer...?No, but I don't know what triggered it. And yes, have restarted several times.Very nice name even though it looks highly impractical for anything other than disguise.The first unibody MacBook Pros had removable batteries. The unibody construction method is also supposed to be more environmentally friendly, as the excess aluminum machined away can be melted into a new block to machine.It also improves general durability. Because the body can't flex, things like lid hinges, port openings, and internal connectors of all kinds don't experience the same wear and tear as other laptops. Anyone who has experienced the pain of having to replace a laptop because fixing the connection to the screen or the connection to the power was so expensive will appreciate how uncommon these types of things become with the unibody design.I would say go with this or a light vinyl sticker. Your new mac will survive most falls without needing extra protection. Put the rest of your money in a nice padded bag or an insurance rider to cover an accident.What materials were used before solid aluminum or polycarbonate? Good call on the unibody material being more durable during life and more recyclable at end of life.@bmike Pre-unibody MacBook Pros (and the PowerBooks that preceded them) had an aluminum bottom body that was constructed from flat (probably rolled) aluminum bent on the edges to make the sides and welded on the corners. The electronics and suchlike were put in there, then the top (with the keyboard) was put on. The meeting of those had a plastic spacer (that grabs my arm hairs all the time and is quite annoying). These pre-unibody machines are less durable (corners dent in easily) because the metal was thin (much more so than the unibodies).@bmike The MacBooks (plastic ones) have similar parts in much the same place as the pre-unibody MacBook Pros, but with polycarbonate instead of aluminum. Ironically (and confusingly), the MacBooks tended to be more durable, as the polycarbonate was thicker than the Pro's aluminum case. The top-case, with the keyboard, on the plastic MacBook, however, would deteriorate near the edges and flake off."Let's go shopping" questions are off-topic, per our FAQs. Closing.+1 for good, basic, cross-platform troubleshooting tips.No, it is a local SWF file.. but, as I can open it with the browser, I will check if this plugin does the trickJust saw you tried it. Sorry.I'd be surprised if turning off sounds makes any difference, but the others all make sense.FlashVideo Converter is pricey, but try the demo.Given your demonstrated, detailed, broad knowledge of Mac topics, I have to wonder why you asked this question.  Was it possibly to stick it to the people (including the mighty Jeff Atwood himself) who were shooting down your question about the "unibody" tag on Meta? (http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/496/would-someone-add-unibody-and-non-unibody-tags)  If so, I admire your gumption.  ;]I'll try this! Thanks.Well, I found out what caused it to stop working.  I deleted his account, recreated it and set it to standard with no PC.  Naturally, everything works.  Then, I went into his home directory and added my account (with recursive drilldown) so that I can access his stuff.  And when I logged back in, I couldn't change anything.  Had to delete the account again.  I've locked his account down again (PC and SimpleFinder) and I still can't change his desktop.  This is a brand new iMac so I don't see how anything is corrupt.The glyph looks like one from the [Last Resort font](http://developer.apple.com/fonts/LastResortFont/) that is used when the requested font is not available. Most of the system UI uses Lucida Grande, but I am not sure if this also applies to your particular dock icon badges. Use *Font Book* to check that **Lucida Grande** is present, enabled, and validates correctly. Related: [AD 11909](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/11909/3349).I was absolutely pondering Jeff's comment when the question formed in my brain. Turns out it's actually a good question as well as a case in point. I don't mind stirring the pot if it provokes some genuine commentary or knowledge sharing. ;-)Then this is the best thing I've seen on this site in a week.  :]A restore seems to have fixed it.  However, it seems that the ipod (ok, it wasn't really mine - it's my sons) has been bounced between two profiles. I wonder if there's something new in 4.3.3 that validates that the app was purchased by the current user?Is it the charger not working, or the light not coming on? Sometimes the light will stay off even though your computer is charging.@ughoavgfhw I'm pretty certain the charger isn't working - OS X shows the battery as not charging, the little lights that come on when I press the button show the battery is losing charge, and the pack itself stays cold. Sometimes it works, but for most of the day it hasn't been.Wow that worked perfectly! I might end up getting desperate enough to buy a new one, but hopefully if I just sit the right way it'll be good enough to get my work done. Thank you VERY much!@Blowski You're welcome -- I'm glad that worked for you!  But trust me that it will eventually degrade to the point where the "wiggle" trick won't work, so replace it as soon as possible.  Don't be stuck without power!  (Also, don't forget to mark this question as answered.)Will the built-in (and hence, free) iPhoto app not work for your purpose?  If not, please provide more detail in your question.  Thanks!Yeah, I'm hoping it will see me out until I get back to London :S@Blowski In the past I've limped one along for over a month (treating it gently), so two weeks is definitely possible.  I wish Apple would make them more durable -- especially considering their cost!Made it a community wiki so I don't get credit for someone else's answer.  If you like it, please also vote up the original question over at Super User (linked in the answer above).Yes I need to replace the version of ruby that is currently installed on the system. This seems to be hard to do based on the answers I am getting.Unfortunately, I'm not sure that we have enough information to help you solve your problem -- unless someone here happens to have run into the same problem you had.  By `automatically log me off` do you mean that it actually logs your user out completely, or does it just lock the screen, requiring your username and password to unlock it?I want to be sure you understand what you're saying.  "Replace" Ruby is very different from "use a different version" of Ruby.  If you want the latter, RVM would be a great option, as several have mentioned.  If you are *sure* you want to *replace* the system's version of Ruby (and understand that may have negative consequences), then I explain how to do that at the bottom of my answer below.  Either way, there should be plenty of information here to answer your question now.It's seems that RVM is the way to go rather than replacing the system version of ruby. Thanks everyone for your input.no it just locks my screen, but this dosent seem like its the first time this has happened. I think this happens occasionally with mac but i do not know why@luca590 It could be a bug related to your computer sleeping while using Safari in Spaces.  (Say that ten times, fast...)  If so, it might be tough to pin down since there's no concrete crash log data.  Next time this happens, try accessing the Safari windows by clicking the Safari icon in your Dock, regardless of what Space you're in.  If that doesn't work, try holding a click on the Dock icon to reveal all Safari windows.Well that didnt fix the problem. However thanks for the advice, ill look into Keynote. I've herd of it before i just havnt bought it. And i didnt have to pay for my Microsoft office (word, powerpoint, excel, etc.) and it is helpful to get everything in one package. I also dont really need anything fancy. If i needed something really sleek i would use Quartz Composer instead. Thank you thoi think it might just have to do with my computer sleeping and using Safari in general, but i will try to open it in a different space next time anyway, and im sure it is a bug, but it just seems like its something apple would have fixed considering im using the "new" macbook pro with 10.6.7, but thanks for your help.@luca590 Disabling spell-check didn't work?  Or reinstalling Office didn't work?  Or did you not want to try either of those?well disabling spell check works in the since that its not telling me im making spelling mistakes, but i do need it to... just not in Spanish, and im not going to try reinstalling Office because PowerPoint is the only one ive had trouble with and i do not want to cancel all of my work and then wait to continue. I dont think its worth reinstallingThis is just this kind of manual I searched for!Also check when you select some text and look into Tools > Language ... what language is there. If your language settings are English (USA) then try set it as a default for entire document.Yes, I know about that shortcut and yes I have checked it there. The problem is that PDF Export from Pages doesn't include TOC when you see in the Sidebar invoked by the very shortcut you've mentioned. Thanks.Additional clarification: I do not want to include TOC inside my text.Also, some aftermarket SSDs don't even support SMART, so be careful.ok, I only need it for macvim for now so make this an answer and I'll accept.Plus: Even if SMART says your disk is in awesome condition, it can stillGreat! Thanks for the very comprehensive answer.One guy from UK Apple Store told me that I cannot get an educational discount if I'am not a student in UK but he told me that I can get it online. (I am a EU student....)Exact figures was what I was after however it's more of a curiosity than a necessity. I have recollections of seeing figures down to single milliamps reported by Device Manager on Windows.Hat-tip to [@barbaz](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/6195/barbaz) for coming up with the idea of using an encrypted OS X volume.Are you installing from the restore disk that came with your mac or a retail version of the OS. The retail version has more drivers and would be better if the new mac isn't a perfect match for the old mac.Nice, I didn't know Flaex! is a nice free solution to get resources from a SWF file.Just because the OS X DVD might have the drivers needed for a MacBook doesn't imply that running the installer from a MacPro (or even a newer model MacBook) will cause those MacBook specific drivers to be installed.Also - I've installed using an external screen all the time. You just have to know the key command to enter mirroring mode for the external display once the OS has booted. On some keyboards, you can press the F7 key, or Command-F1, as a shortcut to turn video mirroring on or off. This would be your best bet if you don't have the same model mac to run the install in target mode to ensure success on the driver installation.Excellent information - especially since any new tech will have more initial failures it will be hard to separate the modes of premature failure from modes of eventual failure. thanks for calling both out :-)If using an retail OS DVD, it will install whatever drivers the machine running the install has. But as you note bmike in your answer, this usually isn't a problem but may cause strange issues.With SSD - the idea of a "sector" is still confusing to me. I assume the drive controller has a virtual map of what it pretends is a real sector but in practice is mapped all over the place in cells on the flash storage and subject to garbage collection and relocation/ refreshing as needed.What country are you in?Thanks to @KeithB for pointing out errors that are now corrected in this answer.The brightness control in the iOS multitasking bar maps to the brightness control in the settings app. Both of those settings persist correctly. The one colored off-white accessible from the top right page doesn't map to the other brightness controls and gets reset each time the app closes.or an RSS feed? It might be easier if you give the URL of the radio show so we can see+1 for going to http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/intlstoreroutingpage.html and just chatting with an Apple representitive to see what the sales policies are currently.Before you buy - make sure you understand that where you buy your mac establishes your support and warranty in that country. You go through them first to get support so where you buy matters if you need help later.The "AskPassGUI" worked. Looks like it's actually the passphrase gui that did the adding to ssh-agent.Have you tried using the command key and dragging the icon out of the menu bar. Hopefully the SystemUI server will remember your choice unless SugarSync insists on checking and re-inserting itself often.Check out this post at Coding Horror: "I feel ethically and morally obligated to let you in on a dirty little secret I've discovered in the last two years of full time SSD ownership. Solid state hard drives fail. A lot. And not just any fail. I'm talking about catastrophic, oh-my-God-what-just-happened-to-all-my-data instant gigafail. It's not pretty." http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html-1 Looking into USB Prober was a very time-consuming diversion that ultimately yielded lots of esoteric data about a USB device, but no special insights about its power consumption outside of what System Profiler offers relatively easily by comparison.  Also, Xcode is no longer free as of version 4 -- it's included with *paid* Developer accounts (starting at $99/year) or can be purchased separately on the Mac App Store for $5.Thank you - awesome link. We all can look at a race motorcycle and tell why it is so much faster than a street bike and know in our guts that when it fails at speed, it isn't going to be pretty. I don't see the industry educating us to the risks inherent with this new speed.If you are getting push notifications on other networks, you can rule out the update to 4.3.2 as well as the phone. You might try deleting the network settings for your home network, first on the phone and then investigate the router for failure / software changes.Thanks, I was unaware of `asl.conf`. The actual problem was a newline, so you were close.Do you need the terminal window or just run the command line program?Since SSD have spare capacity you can't really "fill them up with garbage" to overwrite all the memory cells - but two or three random write passes has been shown to reduce the amount of data that's retrievable to something like < 10%@Mark I need the terminal window so I can see the output of the command.Forgive me for the quesion - but what is the "applications menu" and how is it different from a text document containing the command you wish to execute?@bmike By "Applications menu" I am referring to [this contraption](http://i.imgur.com/A6vWH.png). What do you call it? Applications place?Thanks for a succinct answer. The majority of the permission errors I have observed in my Mac occur with Java (1.6.0 jdk), and the JavaVM.Framework. They occur repeatedly.I am live in Romania so I suppose that any EU Apple store would be required to recognize me as a student. Also I do not really care so much about the support, I am interested only about warranty and from my knowledge this is international as long you are buying from an official store (not ebay)Here is a question regarding the education discount amount you can get http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/13968/1916... and copy the resulting `.app` file into the folder `/Applications` so it shows up where you (op) saidThe crashes are very unusual so I would install from scratch - especially rebuilding your dev environment as it is likely something in that is causing the issuesTo be clear, are you referring only to function keys and modifier keys?@bmike: Your edit should be made a comment. While I can appreciate the effort, I think sometimes your edits go a bit too far.+1 Automator is a great multi-purpose tool.DTerm is just a terminal and does not produce an appThis in combination with Chris's comment above solved it. Thanks!@Chris the related question has this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11909/strange-keyboard-shortcut-icons-in-mac-os-10-6-7/13435#13435I know that, but if you check the 2nd comment to the question you would think that the person needs to see an outcome of a command not a program/app. In that light this solution could be useful without running an Automator script.It's not clear to me how to cause the Automator workflow to open a new terminal window and run the command inside. Can you please elaborate on this?@mxmissile You're welcome -- glad you got it fixed!You set a setting that let you press just Fn to open Expose?That's correct... and I have no idea where.Did you try getting it from your install discs? Sorry about that, I was sure it was still free. What on earth?Re: Wondering if an SSD-enabled iMac will see an improvement: It absolutely will.It caught me by surprise too, when I found out.  When Xcode 4 was released this past March they decided that it wasn't going to be free anymore.  You can still use the old developer tools on OS X install DVDs -- but again, USB Prober won't be helpful in this particular case.the edits to your question make the answer much better but you still play both sides. You "insist" he shouldn't run it locally, warn about focusing on a server instead of tasks, and point out running a big machine 24/7 is less efficient than a small mini - all reasons why server and every day mac is a bad idea. Get (or rent) a small server focused on serving (colocated if possible) - get a big workstation to do work.Thank you - i know it as the applications folder which is one of the shortcuts in a finder sidebar. Excellent clarification! Thank you.@bmike what edits?sorry - ongoing conversation here that clarify the answer. my bad.Something like that sounds programatic or software since random errors should be distributed randomly. FSeventer or fs_usage might be worth deploying to see who is accessing those files. Highly concerning to have developer code self destructing like that. I might add them to a spotlight and time machine exclusion list temporarily to see if it's a collision of worlds between fseventsd / mds and java file IO. Curious if your filesystem is HFS+ journaled case-insensitive. I've seen other fs choices go wonky from time to time.Do you mean G4 PowerBook? The MacBook line (including the Pro) was introduced with the Intel processors.Is there a reason you can't use a metadata-based system (e.g. iTunes playlists) for this kind of organization?  If someone told me they wanted to organize resources using symbolic links instead of metadata, I would warn them of the possibility of exactly the kind of situation you outlined here in your question.+1.  For Austin's comment.  Also - just copying the aliases over should be sufficient as long as the directory structure is the same, no?The first question I like to ask when I see someone trying to fit a square peg into a round hole is "Why don't you try using the round peg?"  In other words, why not just use one of the other clients that, from the information you have provided in your question, you seem to think are better?  (Not trying to be a jerk -- I just like to make sure the obvious and easy solutions have been considered.)I'm just trying to use and evaluate new clients.I use Ableton Live for DJing and it's really useful to have this kind of setup when digging through tunes finding something to play.. I could go in to detail about it but let's just say Live doesn't have a nice iTunes style metadata browser :)@Harv Hmmm maybe I'm breaking the aliases with the way I'm copying the folder to an external disk. I'll try again later with a direct copy..@mash aaah okay.  Innnteresting.  Yeah, let us know how it works out.Thanks -- Yes I did.I guess my case is the second. I'm using Twitterrific 4.1I tried to update to 4.1.1 but it says 4.1 is the latest version.While this seemed to work in the beginning, after launching parallels, it got rid of the folder automatically. Additionally, when I added the folder manually, it was not sorted correctly (i.e. folders should come before applications).Can you sleep the machine (when you close the lid, what happens)? When it's asleep, what happens when you pull the power cord? Can you run the machine on battery? What does it display when you run it plugged into the wall but with no battery in?Good to know that you have to do it through the Parallels preferences.  You should mark this as the answer to your question.This is very different from what I see on 10.6.7.  My menus list only the F1-F13 keys, plus "Secondary" and "Middle" mouse buttons.@Austin Mine shows these same options under 10.6.7, and doesn't show mouse options. Is this the "All Windows" leftmost menu you're clicking?@Matthew Ah, you're right -- I was clicking the menu under the "Dashboard" section.  +1 for this answer.@user6385 Good diagnosis. Yes, now that you point it out, it was easy to spot the no-final-newline bug in `get_line_from_file` in [syslogd.tproj/daemon.c](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/syslog/syslog-100.2/syslogd.tproj/daemon.c).You don't need to modify the template or add the prefpane to take advantage of url like twitter:@trox - just add it in as a web page and you are golden.Ouch - if the partition identifier is changed, then the partitions are gone as far as mac is concerned. You'll need a hex editor or be really good with dd to fix that from the command line.That's a really odd sound...I've seen that thread and tried both the commands you gave me, but they both just leave the console hanging and appear to do nothing. Thanks though.@Dave this is working really well! Any chance you know how to speed it up to every 10 seconds (instead of 60)?To which animations are you referring?  I can say pretty confidently that it's not possible to disable *all* animations in OS X, but there are settings for some of them (the Dock, for example).@Austin // Um..I want to turn off as many animations as possible like windows. I can turn off basically all the animation on windows..Please include *all* relevant information in the body of your question.  If there is a lot of information, summarize the salient points.  Links to external sites are discouraged because those resources could disappear at some point.  (Stack Exchange sites aim to provide a lasting resource that will not just be helpful to the person posting the question, but others searching on that topic in the future.)But to provide a brief answer to your question, yes, the RAM is probably faulty and should be replaced.  Newegg has a good return policy, so you should have no trouble.There is no global option to disable all animation, and there is animation in nearly *everything*, so any reasonably comprehensive answer would be unreasonably long.  Are there a handful of elements you could mention that are particularly offensive to you?@Austin You really should check the checkmark next to this answer: it is the answer to your question, and it will improve your acceptance rate. Similarly you should do the same for any other correct answers you've received: the more questions you have answered where you don't accept an answer, the less likely you are to get help in the future.@Matthew I think you meant to address that last comment to @Ian?  ;]  And I already mentioned that to him in a comment on the question above.First, make sure the RAM is pushed in all the way. If it still doesn't work, get some new RAM (check to make sure it's compatible).@APShredder Maybe Apple disabled this "feature" or maybe the command was never updated for iOS 4. The link is from 2009 so it's possible that it just doesn't work. As for launching apps, it seems like you would need to launch them with SpringBoard but I don't know how you would do that.@Austin Sorry, you're right.Pretty sure that "mysql" is the wrong tag. :)yea i checked a few times it was all the way in. can you suggest another brand i can try that has been tried?I actually just realized that I do have that small flash drive.  It is just so incredibly small and hidden in the instruction booklet. :|  Thanks!I'll second this suggestion. Until ram fails 3 times - reseating each time more carefully than the last, it could be user error. You can easily mix things to determine which of the two sticks might be bad.@MatthewFrederick MY System's Queer Language?Given the system's age...  If there was a long period (12 months or more) during which the computer was unused, you might consider trying a new battery.  Actually, you might want to try a new battery anyway -- their expected lifespan is about a year or two of regular use, and almost always less than three years under optimal conditions.Unfortunately FileVault is nowhere near as secure as whole disk encryption; it's even less secure than simply having a truecrypt volume. This is because FileVault simply employs user permissions to restrict access to its contents, which can be easily overcome if an attacker has physical access to your machine.I just installed the trial version.  If I change a memo in Outlook, it correctly syncs to the iPhone.  However, if I change a memo on the iPhone, it seems to revert the change immediately (IOW, the memos on the iPhone seem to be read-only).  Is this expected behaviour, or it this just an issue in the trial version?@Mike I don't see how Filevault is different than TrueCrypt - both mount encrypted volumes that the operating system protects with user permissions. When unmounted (in the case of Filevault, when the user is logged out) they're both just encrypted files on the disk. It's not full disk encryption, but it's no worse than TruecryptThe trial should be fully functional, and I'm pretty sure that's not the expected behavior.  If you think it might be a problem with your setup, try posting a specific question about it here on Ask Different.  If you think it might be a bug in the app, you could try contacting the developer: http://rerlsoft.com/home/FAQ_And_Contact_Details.htmlGood thought -- it does sound rather "game-like".Off topic, but what program did you use for the FFTs?@neoneye, @bmike : Used FSEventer. The permissions change occurs in the same aforementioned directory, and each time Disk Utility "repairs" it, the permissions revert to their previous state, and this seems to be stuck in an endless loop. 
Possibly a conflicting configuration change by an application, or recurring false alarms by Disk Utility?
I don't see any changes occurring prior to running Disk Utility though.I also see this screen, however, the Fn key was not displayed as the All windows key, which said F9. When I opened the drop down and re-selected the already-selected F9, the Fn key stopped performing the All window expose action. Display bug!Or use [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) instead. It's an excellent pdf viewer, much more feature rich than preview. And it's free.Cool, nice find.Hi bmike. I am wondering whether it will be helpful to flush and reset the MAS settings/preferences and cache. I have not done that yet. I remember reading about flushing the preferences for Spotlight in order to fix a bug in MAS where it wouldn't show any of your installed/purchased applications.+1 to you all. I was of the opinion that Live did a pretty good job of integrating iTunes metadata (e.g. BPM field can be used to house key, and then key is available in Live). Is this not the case? Been a while since I used it and I may confusing it with Traktor or something similar. I believe @Harv is right though. The symlinks should still work as long as the directories are the same. Interested to find out. Good luck.Very interesting. Thanks.4. doesn't seem to work when copy/pasting images from Thunderbird to Mail. Strangely, when I compose an email in Mail, the image shows when I write the mail, but when receiving the mail, the image doesn't show. I am copy/pasting html code from Thunderbird (but from rendered view) where the images are referenced like <a href="file:///Users/myuser/myimage.jpg">, however, when looking into the raw source of the received mail I see that the reference in html still remains like that, and the images have not been embedded into the mail.Does the APN settings hack still work as of May 2011?No, I want to be able to leave my computer logged for a few moment and been sure that nobody can read my received emails (if Mail is not already started) for instance. But more generally, that nobody would be able to launch an App, make some stuff and quit during my absence.In that case just set a "hot corner" in the screen saver and require a password to exit the screen saver. When you leave your Mac then push the mouse into the hot corner to lock the screen.But this does not work for images that you reference locally via file:///Users/path/to/image.jpg - why not? The same html signature works fine in Thunderbird and it knows how to properly embed the local files as image/jpeg mime type into the mail. However, Mail is just keeping a reference to the local file in html code. Why is that? It's 2011... are they kiddin' me? (Putting the images remotely onto the web has the disadvantage that some mail client require the users to confirm to 'display remote images' often, while embedded images are more likely to be displayed immediately.Mac OS X sees the partitions just fine but is definitely listing them as hidden (as per the partition identifier). I'll post more details when I get a chance but using GPartd, or any other partitioning tools, is something I would like to avoid if it can be natively done in Mac OS X.The use of dd would be acceptable. I'll experiment and consider accepting your answer if successful.The requirement is part of a build process I am working on. I have no wish to add another partitioning tool to the mix and unfortunately Disk Utility via the GUI or otherwise does not do what I need it to do, hence the question.you can disable unity by selecting ubuntu classic at the login screen.1. Gnome 3; 2. drivers compatibleor set the timeout for the screen saver to be short - Mail will not necessarily be the only app you want to hideSo it's not possible to set a passoword on an App...@Fake Name [Sonic Visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/)I use SuSE 11, CentOS 5 and Fedora all without issues within VMWare 2.x virtual machines. It's at the point where I don't even think about compatibility any more. They all just work when virtualized.Hey man thanks for going out of your way for telling me that. That way, using carbon copy cloner wasn't going to do it either which I was thinking of doing. Cheers!@Jon, did you have any better luck than [I did](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10733/automaticly-and-seamlessly-sync-iphone-photos-as-soon-as-theyre-taken-over-the), so far?`even when ControllerMate isn't open` so they key mapping must be in a configuraion file of some kind right? do you know which one or if there is one at all?I figured out that print screen, scroll lock and pause map to F13 - F15, so the only useless keys there are left are the shortcut keys, i.e. navigation, mail, etc.hard to tell - i'd say experiment if you are sure you can recover from a backup of your mac and live with it or call apple support if you need this machine to keep working.I  am using VirtualBox and have got some problems with video driverIndeed - Apple goes to such great length to hide driver dependancies (and really does a fabulous job merging code branches once things ship and stabilize), but the system to make macs easy still doesn't provide a universal image that will run all macs.Wow. Keep in mind that Disk Utility just reads the receipts database that say how Apple wanted the files to be installed. If another program modifies them, Disk Utility doesn't agree with the changes so it's a game of cat and mouse. We know the cat is Disk Utility - fs_usage might let you know which program is the mouse.No, nothing like that.  Nothing's changed on this Mac security wise since the last time I successfully used the Mac App Store.I tried that but Mail seems to be messing up the html. For some reason it's unable to position multiple images beside each other. Seems like Mail.app is generating some improper html code (object embedding tags) that force a line break. See the screenshot here: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/706/emailsigu.png/, which shows my html sig both in Safari and (same html code) in Mail. Ridiculous how Mail is so far behind Thunderbird, but I guess I need to put the icons into a html table. Ugly... but I guess it's the only way...Yes, when it comes to email, tables unfortunately still rule the day.OS X has the open command in the terminal, which uses the default system file handler to launch the file for example: `$ open /Applications/Safari.app/` will launch Safari. Not sure if it works on iOS, as I don't have a jailbroken phone. It can also open other things `$ open 'http://paperclipped.com/'` will open the the url in your default browser.ControllerMate has a small-footprint helper app running in the background at all times, presumably monitoring I/O. The app is closed, but the helper app remains running.@Kyle TrueCrypt does not employ user permissions; you need to specify a new password for each encrypted volume you create.@Mike Resetting the user's password isn't enough to obtain access to their filevault. Now if you're talking about cracking the password with some sort of brute force attack, my guess is that you'd be about as successful at that as cracking a Truecrypt passwordI stand corrected. I was unaware that once FileVault was turned on for an account, one needs to enter a master password to change that account's password even when using another admin account. (I just verified this on my machine)Am I missing something? Can't you just set up a rule with those exact two conditions and select `any` in the popup: "If **any** of the following conditions are met:" What's wrong with using two conditions?We are also experiencing this exact problem on three different macs, all running snow leopard with everything up to date. we have yet to find a solution, and it requires holding down our power buttons to get our (8-month-old) mac pro's up and running again. what should our IT guy be looking for in the network logs? he has not found anything that stood out for him as being a problem.Thanks, I'll try VMware as wellThis output problem is totally new to me. Furthermore, fortune-mod has been spitting out fortunes from /etc/bashrc since fink was born, and scp never output it. Nevertheless, I think your advice is sage and I'll take it. Thanks!The problem is that I have a lot of filters and some of them have several email addresses so I would have to go through all these duplicating every From: test and making it an Any recipient: test - a maintenance headache as well as all the initial pain. I miss Eudora sometimes...I'm sure there's an app out there that does this for you.  You could also chown the app to a different user on the machine, and if you set the permissions the right way, you wouldn't be able to run that app without authenticating first.  I think.The /Library/Application Support/Automator/ folder didn't exist, but ~/Library/Application Support/Automator/ did and was empty -.-'This sounds like an example of the [XY problem](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem).  You want to prevent people from snooping in your email (X), so you're asking about how to protect your email program (Y).  What you really might want to ask is `What's the best way to protect my email from snooping?`  And the answer to that would be that it's best to completely prevent unauthorized users from using your account -- for example, requiring a password to deactivate the screensaver or after waking the system from sleep.@Paul +1 I would recommend editing that great suggestion about setting up the password protected screensaver directly into your answer.Wow, 3 upvotes in 4 hours? I didn't expect too many people to use such a hack, especially since you have to create one applescript for each app you want to protect. I'd like to hear how people are using my solution, even if just for learning new tricks.I thought there was a way to force Mac OS X to refresh the list of the applications that integrate with Mobile Me synchronization, or at least that is what I remember I did 3-4 years ago, when I had the same "problem." I don't remember which command line I used, nor if I used a command line at all.Thanks! I'll try to edit the script to work with other apps. I'll post the result.@Tyilo Sorry, that's what I meant. Fixed my answer, even if it's wrong. :)Wow, that was easy!Doesn't exist either and also tried /Library/Workflows/Upvote for @Austin's comment. Even if you stop Mail.app from opening, you haven't prevented someone from accessing your email. Mail.app keeps your email in plaintext on disk in `~/Library/Application Support` -- if someone wants your email, they'll know to just grab the files from there and make off with those.@bitbonk Glad I was able to help!Strange...  `~/Library/Services/` is the default location for new services created in Automator, and I just confirmed that myself by creating a new service.-1, but I hope this is not taken personally.  I really like the level of detail here, and it's clear a lot of thought went into this, but I think this solution gives a dangerous false sense of security.  One huge caveat that you didn't mention is that it does not prevent access to the plain-text `.emlx` mail files stored in `~/Library/Mail`.@Ian I believe the plain-text `.emlx` files are actually located in `~/Library/Mail`, but your point is well taken.Definitely a good option!I feel stupid now - I didn't realize it was selecting the folders from characters I typed in such an intuitive manner.@Austin you're entitled to your downvote of course, but I don't understand your reason. I think my caveats and paranoia sections should be enough to indicate that this is not meant to be a secure solution - it's only a deterrent. I added your caveat, but it's essentially the same idea behind caveat #2. Also, the OP said that he/she didn't care about another person reading "already retrieved emails".This does work well, but I miss more calls through google voice as it sometimes sends the caller to google voice mail before the forwarded call rings my iPhone - not a huge deal, but might be a big drawback for some that call heavily and depend on always being able to pick up calls from people that don't know the real cell number.It was easier when iSync was in charge of everything. It could still be possible but it's well hidden from me :-)I had that problem with files being in used. The caveat is that if these files are used by daemon/launchd processes they might not be easily terminated. To workaround this kind of issue you can boot the machine from OS X Startup Disk and run Disk Utility from it.I stand in awe of many complicated things I'll never use in real life. This is one - well done Kelvin - you've earned a +1 from me on this. :-) I doubt it will end up the "best" answer possible for this question, but I hope it scores honorable mention.I think you're misunderstanding that part of the question (granted, it could probably be worded better).  @Rabskatran -- please correct me if I am wrong, but I am fairly confident that the OP was trying to explain the reason for wanting to password protect the app.  To paraphrase, even though a snoop wouldn't be able to retrieve *new* mail (presumably because the account password wasn't stored in Mail), they *would* be able to read *existing* downloaded mail, and that is why an OP wanted the password protection.Welcome to the mac - everything is as subtle as possible - even to the point of not being discoverable. Take time to watch others work with their macs. It's hard to tell someone tricks, but you will see them and know to ask. Also check out http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html - it's manna for keyboard typers.+1 Paul was the first to mention this in a comment below his own answer, but since he hasn't integrated it into his own answer yet, I'll vote this up.  I wish I could give this +3 for `you have to lock your computer.  Period.`You could write a script that removes all broken aliases on your computer but I'm sure you already knew that since you said "automatically" delete. Maybe have the script run every day? I'm interested to see if there is a solution as well.A total guess, but perhaps there's a heavy weighting on the gross earnings or number of paid purchases for apps that aren't free.+1 Definitely a secret, and for one of the primary reason Google's is a secret: so people can't game the system, ensuring they get the best results.+1 Great advice, and great suggestions for blogs to follow.Worth noting that that Mac Mini could only support 8GB ram with a specific firmware update (though I'm struggling to find exact details on it, but its mentioned here: http://www.macminicolo.net/state2009.html). I assume if you've been using it regularly since purchase you'd have all updates installed though?No result in Spotlight and the terminal command showed no results: 'tyilos-macbook:~ Tyilo$ cd /
tyilos-macbook:/ Tyilo$ sudo find ./ -type f -name "*.workflow"
Password:
find: .//dev/fd/3: Not a directory
find: .//dev/fd/4: Not a directory'@Tyilo Sorry, there was a typo in the Terminal command that I corrected.  Try it again, and if it doesn't find anything in your home directory (`~`), try running it from the system's root directory (i.e. enter `cd /` before running the find command).  *This will take a while, so be prepared to be patient.*@Tyilo And of course, you can search the root folder in the GUI by opening `Macintosh HD` in Finder and typing `.workflow` into the search box.  (Check the `File Name` option instead of `Contents` for a faster search.)  The only disadvantage of this is that it won't search in hidden or system folders, but you probably won't need it to anyway.@Austin: thanks - I'll do thatThanks for this tip, but I need full synch capabilities (especially Apps). Any way to use iTunes?I have seen this too on my Snow Leopard and if I click Cancel on the login dialog, I can access desktop normally.Indeed, I even hope(d) in some hidden OS option, or something. It seems a somewhat natural request.Disk utility repairs the permissions, yet on a subsequent re-run of Disk Utility, the same permissions which got repaired are repaired again. I kept fs_usage running, there was no application/process which attempted an access to said directories/files. Could it be that Disk utility's attempted repairs on these folders/files aren't working at all?@Austin My file wasn't between the files using `cd /` and `sudo find ./ -name "*.workflow" > ~/Desktop/services.txt`. I found two other folders which also could be a possible location, but they didn't contain the file. The locations were `/Library/Application Support/Apple/Automator/Workflows/` and `/System/Library/Services/`. I've uploaded the file here: http://cl.ly/6i1tAdded a screenshot.Now I found out how it happens, please see my updated question.Damn! I thought I had the magic answer :(Wiretap studio DOES have application specific recording, and will record only the audio from that process. You could try the trial.@Matthew Frederick Found all app files using @Austin command, and none of them matched my service title@Austin also tried with `sudo find ./ -name "*" > ~/Desktop/all.txt` and still no match@Tyilo I just checked my system and realized that I'd created an AppleScript app that I then used Automator to turn into a service, hence my .app suggestion. As a result both .app and .scpt files existed for it. Unless you did the same, my suggestion is no help.Cool idea, +1 and I hope you get an answer.I'm only using VMWare Fusion 2.x and it's still rock solid stable and great. 3.x is supposed to be even better.I think someone like you could really get into BumpTop. Check out this [YouTube vid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5IswixD5pw). Unfortunately they were bought by Google a little while back so it's difficult to get hold of the application at the moment. :(Is this question related to [this one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8789/how-to-reenable-youtube-videos-on-safari-with-flash-plugin-10-2)?The Adobe site reports I have version 10.1.102.64 of the plugin, not 10.2; the other question is referring to version 10.2.I just think, its is the 10.2 Flash version.

For one, there is no recording call apps at cydia, and there might never be. My point is: *Not everything becomes possible after jailbreaking*.I've been syncing my Google contacts onto my Mac, and it works.  I'm away from my Mac so I can't check exactly how I have it configured, but it works.oh ok [padding...]Thanks! I actually use a keylayout I made with ukelele, and tried the shortcut keys but ukelele doesn't seem to notice them at all. What do you mean by `mapSet` ?I can see how Apple wouldn't want to expose users to this since it's a privacy risk, but it sure would be cool to have an API for this.@Tyilo Perhaps the extension changed somehow?  Try searching for `sudo find / -name "The Exact Service Name Including Spaces.*"`  (Without the "dot", that should find it across your entire hard drive regardless of the folder from which you initiate the search.)@Tyilo Any chance it would be on a network drive?I hadn't even thought of that. Very possible - fs_usage will let you snoop on Disk Utility, too :-)+1 I believe this is the best way to do it -- I was just trying to provide more information for the OP in my answer and didn't mean for it to become the "accepted" answer.  :/A mapSet "maps" virtual codes to each keypress so they can be assigned to a character in the `.keylayout` XML file.  I don't believe any of the virtual keyboard layouts in Ukelele will have virtual buttons to match those extra Microsoft keyboard keys at the top, so it might not be possible in that program. ... Have you tried ControllerMate?  It seems to do exactly what you want -- you press a "strange" key on your keyboard, and it lets you assign it to whatever you want.@Cawas You're absolutely right, and I hope no one reads my answer as implying that it *is* possible on a jailbroken phone.  Jailbreaking can add some powerful functionality, but it's not magic.@Matthew Frederick Don't have the .scpt file of it :s, but the service file thingy must be somewhere, else it wouldn't workFor those who don't know how to restart an iPad: **press and hold the power button** until "Slide to power off" appears, and slide it. After it's done shutting down, press and hold the power button until it starts up again. This should solve the problem. To completely reset it (this will lose data so back up first), open the **Settings app**, choose **General**, then **Reset**, then either **Reset All Settings** or, if absolutely necessary (this will restore your iPad to factory settings, erasing everything), **Erase All Content and Settings**.If you're really worried about it, you can use your home router's filtering settings to block access to the WAN from the IP assigned to your AppleTV.@Tyilo Have you tried the in-depth search @Austin suggested but for files ending with `.service`. A number of my services have this extension.I sure didn't misread it then! I wanted to add it explicitly to your answer given Justin's edit about jailbreaking. ;)Thank you for pointing to where developments are being made. I'm new to SE but should this be a comment instead of an answer since someone coming to this site looking for an answer will be redirected? I'm upvoting but not accepting.@Matthew - Thanks for the link. Wow, I was ever so keen to replace my ageing MacBook with an iMac. I'll need to think a little bit more now about that. Thanks to you both for bringing this to my attention.I did check but it's empty. Seems that I was charged for some service reason.The answer is amazing, thanks! I've sent the question, let's see what they respond.I haven't got anything by email but according to the online bank the money went to ITUNES-EURO-LUXEMBOURG :) However a couple of days have passed and what I see in the online bank now is that there is no payment like this anymore. Probably it was just a card check like those Paypal does. The transaction is still pending though.The battery of later model MacBooks (ones if non-removable batteries) have a chip that stops charging the battery once it has been fully charged.so I delete my comment.The 5 icon dock restore issue is no longer a problem@Steve I added a better answer, one that should solve the problem today.I have both MobileMe and Gmail set up on the device already.  Gmail is set up as an Exchange account.  Both of them get push email notifications just fine.  I looked at your links, found some debug info in device logs, and updated the question.@Matthew - Excellent, accepted.@Steve Erm... I just noticed that comments on the TUAW article by OWC Grant indicate that despite some people saying HDD Fan Control solves the problem, it may not. You may want to unaccept, or... heh, tough in a volatile "breaking news" situation. :)I don't think that would allow me to burn redbook audio, just the mp3's themselves which wouldn't work. +1 regardless.Do you really have to tell it to use the default port?ping, host and ssh to three separate computername with three different mobilemename is failing.

What DNS server IP are you using to get this to work?Sadly this isn't working for me. I can use finder and screen sharing perfectly so I know the accounts and machines are up and running. Recent Time Capsules with up to date firmware are routers for both macs. Has anyone had this work for them in the last two weeks?Hot dang! the last tip was it. ping and host don't work, but ssh does. That terminal tip is AWESOME.Even though host and ping don't work - ssh started working for me. I'll play a bit and mark an answer once I figure which is better.And no - I don't seem to need to call out port numbers for **sftp** or **ssh** - but it doesn't hurt much to have them ;-)I've seen several mentions on twitter of people doing a yearly erase of their MacBook air and hoping for Lion and trim support to address this. https://twitter.com/th_in_gs/status/68991207367393280`sudo opensnoop -n WorkflowService` didn't show anything at all and couldn't get any reasonable out of just `sudo opensnoop`I appears that some of he commands aren't updated or something similar, which would explain why they don't work.Sweet!

Thanks.Yeah, I didn't see any activity from disk utility either. Okay as this appears to be repeatedly connected with one directory only, guess I should give it a rest :).Adium works with it. iChat doesn't. Mail doesn't. TextEdit does.

Quite well documented, came out day before the election, May 2. Spain as well, actually, although they got the news early enough to vote it down. I would have liked a bit more time, but that is a thought from the dead, uncapped, compassionate past. That's over with.That's super slick. Dude I owe you a beer. Lemme know if you are ever in Miami area. :-)Yeah, I agree that the RIAA is *trying* all kinds of nasty things to find users who have copyrighted material on their HD drivers, but I doubt apple would allow this (via providing a remove backdoor to RIAA or similar) on a vanilla Mac OS X install.I have both Xcode 4.0.2. and Xcode 3.2.5, each installed in a separate folder.

Unfortunately I'm unable to get this working. It won't press "g" at all, in any application. I replaced the key Program through the first closing array with your first code block.

It's just down from the copy-on-select option.I use a macbook and a magic trackpad on my desktop.  No middle button, no right button.  I do have my trackpad setup to do a right click when I tap with two fingers.  I don't know of any way to easily do a middle click on a track pad.  However, I sent the iTerm developer some email, and this was added to the desired feature list.  Hopefully it will get added sometime soon.@Hal you can also set TextEdit as the default app for .doc, so you don't have to navigate sub-menues, just open it...Install BetterTouchTool and you can map more gestures than OS X lets you map by default. I have four finger tap mapped to middle click.I just tested this and it presses the g key every 10 seconds, which is good enough for me. Thank you!I'm not sure I entirely understand this. MacVim is a texteditor, not a terminal. What "rich features" does vim offer that Terminal.app doesn't support?so just c/p the xml file, the library file and the itdb files (genius and extras) into the iTunes folder in the iMac?While I could agree on those updates being somewhat of a pain sometimes, I think the answer to the question is pretty obvious, and I'll state it as another question: "why update any piece of software?" If you don't care about potential fixes, or new features (I have no way of knowing what benefits you might be getting of the update in question) you can just as well skip updating. Nobody is forcing you to do anything you don't want to. Of course you might be missing out of potentially useful stuffAnd, I might add, the location data privacy fixes!!You do realize that Mac OS X comes with command-line `vim`, right?Terminal and iTerm are Unix command lines - vi/MacVim are editors which can call a unix command linethank you for your reply Mark. As I have also mentioned in the question, I have already setup the Media Location, and have been using iTunes with the "messed-up" library for a while. Would this trick work nevertheless?

LAME!Shopping questions are off topic.This one is a hardware shopping recommendation. Which are all off topic as per the FAQ.I was hoping to have an answer other than this. I've come across this before, but I can't believe it's the best answer, predominately because of things like the feature I mention in [my other GarageBand/iChat question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14114/application-bridge-for-ichat-audio-video-channels).@Mark Shopping recommendations are of the form "I'm looking to buy an X, is product Y or product Z better?" or "What is the best product to do X?". The reason why those are bad is because they are, among other things, too localized. This question is of a different form, and has broader appeal, so I think it's OK.Some guy reported something similar (30 mins) over on SU yesterday.If anybody who downvoted this question reads this, it'd be great if you un-downvoted it if you did so only because you felt it was "not allowed per the FAQ". If you have a legitimate reason, then don't listen to me if you still think it should remain downvoted :).This is perfect for me, thanks! At least on my t-mobile phone, gmail sends a picture of the email (rather than the text containing it) so that neatly sidesteps the limit of sms messages, though I do have to watch for my phone's all-too-small memory limit)Ok, first of all yes, I know the `vim` command line app, that's actually the whole point. My guess was that MacVim uses some sort of command line interface which you don't get to see because it is always in `vim` mode. exiting this `vim` mode in macvim means exiting macvim.

We plan to test the code on actual 3.x devices before releasing, but want to be able to test in the 3.x simulator while we get access to the devices in order to speed up development. Installing Xcode 3.x won't help because the project won't compile on Xcode 3.x with 3.x SDKs due to missing classes. It compiles on Xcode 4 (4.x SDKs setting 3.0 as the target), and we are able to run it on 3.x devices this way, but we have not been able to run it in the 3.x simulators for now.More info: I managed to install Xcode 3.2.1, which includes SDKs 3.0 to 3.1.3, but the project won't compile on these SDKsI haven't been able to make run 3.0 to 3.1.3 simulators on Xcode 4 (I tried installing the simulator PKGs on the Xcode 4 folder, the simulator appears on the schemes menu, but I doesn't run).the server (laptop) is expecting a full url http://subdomain.domain.co.uk  when I enter this into the ipad I get: Safari cannot open the page because it is not connected to the internet.Air is not as powerful a processor, but screen/tmux/vim is THE low memory stack!

As long as the phone is dry and it cools slowly - very low temperatures won't hurt, but don't help either. Condensation forming from a humid device rapidly cooled will corrode or damage the insides so risking that isn't normally a good idea.I've been seeing this with OS 10.6.6 and Firefox 4.

I do not have the exact computer with me right now but will check it tomorrow.I'm a big fan of Spaces and use Ctrl-number to switch between them just as you're doing in Win 7.With `command` + `shift` + `tab` the switcher opens from the last application used and you can also navigate back by holding `shift`. I got used to it and might be more comfortable than `~`, but it's personal, I guess. Just hitting `command` + `tab` brings you right to the last window you used. From my experience with the most things you do you won't use more than three applications, so the default switcher is pretty fast and accurate.@MikeyByCrikey Of course I did. Screen Sharing program asked me the password. Is it the evidence of correct address? Can I know the program used on Windows side?For what it's worth, I think Kiosk mode is enabled but you have to open Chrome from the command line to pass it the --kiosk parameter. That being said, I haven't been able to pass any parameters successfully.You can also use the mouse to select an app when you're in the `Cmd`+`Tab` menu.@Lars I don't think this is a feature, but rather a glitch that @bmike explained in his answer. Maybe you could try placing only 5 icons on your desktop, connecting the external display, and then see if anything happens. Does it happen every time you connect the display?You can hide the title bar with fullscreen mode (cmd-shift-F), but the menus are still all enabled.The thickness thing has pretty much been disproven. It turns out that, like most manufactured goods, all iPhones differ slightly in thickness. One report I read showed that much variation between 4 different black iPhones.To follow up: yes it did magically begin working again a few days later. It's happened once more since then. I have no clue what's going on.@Matthew: I would think that even the temperature of the phone would make a difference, when we are talking about variations as small as that.@jason404 Agreed. 0.2mm is equivalent to the diameter of 1-2 human hairs.Does Hotmail support IMAP?is a sim card inserted into the device?It has Exchange IMAP, which Mail supports. Updated my answer to be more specific, thanks!This seems to happen when there's "high CPU" activity, can you confirm that it happens like that? It might point towards some sort of overheat or memory problem.yes, and it's connected to wifi. even has an active data plan.But AFAIK this will only work on mobile devices (iPhone, Android, etc.) - right ??This doesn't work with tasks though, yet.If you're really running 10.6.8, you're not going to find many folks here with any knowledge of it.  This is probably best fed back to Apple.@JRobert oops, wrote it without checking, thought .8 was the newest version. Editing now.i can't drag it off.The apple script isn't real kiosk mode, it's just normal full screen. Thanks for the link to safe.--kiosk isn't enabled in OS X as of yetUnfortunately not. I tried that before. I then don't get the `E185: Cannot find color scheme desert` error, but still all the others.Apple only provides phone numbers on their Web site.Yeah, it was in Server Admin - thanks!Non-admin users don't actually own their home folders and many files/folders with personal data in them. This won't delete safari history, syncing history, and other data a typical user would expect to clean. Also - srm might be better to shred the data since without an admin password the user can't securely erase disk space after the fact. Probably overkill, but useful to mention just in case.I would seriously consider making a new admin account so you can erase free space and really clean things. The system is designed to prevent non-admin users from deleting some personal data and even admin users have to jump through hoops to delete the default folders. You don't have to hack their account - just get yourself another admin account and password and leave a shell user once you've shredded / deleted your personal traces.All reports of this being systematically true seem to be false and due to errors in measurement and one time manufacturing variations rather than a systematic change in specifications.with the machine belonging to the employer, not him, i wouldn't recommend this.It would imagine `brew uninstall imagemagick`...+1 if you :s/cron/launchd/OK, so if I want to shift from the "On my Mac" system to the Gmail folder system, what's the best way to do this? Also if I have multiple email accounts I suppose that it won't work since not everything is going into the same email account... unless I force all my email accounts to forward to my gmail account so they are all going into the same space.Good point calling out ownership - Without knowing what agreements are in place it's folly to recommend anything (of which I'm clearly guilty) - ignoring policy can get you fired and deleting company data could land you in court but ownership of user data is less clear even when there is no expectation of privacy on a work computer.You can move email from the local mac to gmail simply by dragging and dropping the folder to the new location. Mail will then carry out the move by uploading the information from the local store to gmail. It doesn't matter how it got to the mac or which account. Once it's done, you can delete the "on my mac" copy of the mail. No need to forward unless you want that as well as moving past messages.I think what he's saying is that he did not install it with homebrew, but he wishes to do so. In which case this does not answer his question.I think that this question is better suited for superuser.com.I think it's on-topic.I kind of have to agree with Guffa...it is not really photography related, it is more "computer/gadget" related. It may involve photographs in a passing manner, but the technicalities of the question are probably more likely to be answered on superuser.com.@Reid: It's about moving files from a camera to a computer, the only thing photo related is that the files happen to be images taken with the phone camera. Perhaps there is a meta-discussion to be had about this... after all, the beta is for ironing out these things...Here's a thought experiment: what if the OP were having trouble transferring his photos from a Nikon D90? Would you consider it on-topic then?We should probably move this discussion to meta.OK, but the link to the meta discussion would be helpful: http://meta.photo.stackexchange.com/questions/103/move-off-topic-questions@Reid: Interresting point. Although the topic is the same, one also has to consider where the users can be found that can answer the question. jrista makes some interresting points in the meta-thread (that was not really about when a question is off-topic, but about whether the option to move questions to superuser will be available).Oops, looks like I didn't read the meta question carefully enough. Here's another meta question dealing specifically with whether this question is on topic: http://meta.photo.stackexchange.com/questions/108/questions-about-devices-which-take-pictures-but-where-the-camera-is-not-the-firI do actually have an Eye-Fi card. Looks like this app will do the trick -- that is, when it is updated to work with iOS4. Thanks for the tip!I think the OP is looking for a bulk upload.So they expect to get a "lot" of calls from international customers.it just not have that menu. When i right-click on the folder, only "open sidebar preferences" is there.i tried but nothing happend after i drag it offWow - I figured the long term storage implications of a full battery to be the same as always having it charged and topped up (and risk 20% permanent capacity loss annually). The new unibody batteries last so many more cycles I'm less concerned about duty cycles - perhaps the old data with simpler battery controllers is less relevant?You can setup your system with your Mac OS X cd and revert to the last time machine backup.@chan are you sure you're clicking the folders? "open preferences" only appear if you click on "empty space"but this will be a slower restore that CCC or superduper which have a complete duplicate@Mark Slower, perhaps -- but your backup of your personal data is always guaranteed to be perfectly up-to-date as long as you're connected to the Internet.  For cloning-style backup apps, you'd have to expend significant effort to make daily backups.-1 for Tunnelblick -- it uses a setuid tool on itself.  In reality, it's just a gui wrapper for OpenVPN (which is a very good product), but with potential security holes.My purpose is to take videos along with the device for offline use.I tested Dropcopy - it installs on OSX and iPad from App Store and allows simple file copying. It does it jobs, but 1) doesn't run on background on iPad 2) doesn't have transfer queue - you need to copy one file at time 3) doesn't have automatic sync features.On the positive side, Dropcopy has cool visual animation which reminds me of hyperspace gates of various sci-fi shows.Also looks like Dropcopy video player has been designed to preview files - though it has normal QuickTime full-screen player.Do you have requirements that cannot easily be fulfilled using Dictionary and the tools included with OS X?actually if you follow the instructions it corrects the problemIs one of them better than the other ?Since its been a couple of days, did search in "All Messages".  All Previous Shutdown Cause have been 0 or 3.  Did update question.I have the ST95005620AS so it's similar - it has been louder, but a firmware revision (SD24 I think) assisted with that. Console.app ... this might be something, I can't even run that. It bounces in the dock and I then I get a error report and an offer to reopen (repeat to fade)@mcgrailm Not always. Rarely, in fact. Following the directions only fixes the problem if iTunes happens to have recently gathered info about that song (e.g, a new release). For songs like those mentioned in the question, iTunes will probably never get enough info about them.Ah, I needed to create/open a document, that was it. Thanks!@Unsliced - interesting.  Boot from the OS X CD that came with your computer, or a retail copy.  Go through the first screen until you get a menu bar.  Access Utilities -> Disk utility.  You will want to check the disk out and make sure it's okay, as well as verify and repair disk permissions.  Once you've done that come back and let us know if anything's changed.  By chance, did you migrate from an old system/installation, and use Migration Assistant?i actually wanted to read it. But you see its over 200 pages and I'd take more than 1 entire day to finish iti do know that i need a wifi or 3g connection..ok my data plan is active. i can sms / make calls etc. Im not trying to connect using wifi. i'm trying to connect using 3gs, how may i do it?-1: Not an answer.@Nathan but I do have that same song and followed the instructions and it fixed the problemI still get the same thing myself occassionally. Sometimes restarting the phone helps, other times not.You get the 20% (or similar) capacity loss **no matter what you do**, as it is a function of breakdown of the battery chemically. There is a slight increase in capacity loss if you keep the battery charged all the time (most manufacturers actually recommend long-term storage at ~40% charge). However, either way, actually using the battery is worse then keeping it charged.Eye-Fi app will work for this, and works fine with iOS4. Possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10733/automaticly-and-seamlessly-sync-iphone-photos-as-soon-as-theyre-taken-over-the/It is possible to have multiple libraries. Hold down option while you launch iTunes and you can select a different library or create a new library.@mcgrailm @Nathan it totally depends on your library. Imagine you only had one country song. Of course iTunes won't be able to find a similar song if there is nothing else like it in **your** library.My experience: first drive failed in the first week. Replacement drive lasted about a year then failed when I tried to do a system update.FYI, in most text processing apps Cmd-LeftArrow moves the cursor to the beginning of the line, aka Home, and Cmd-RightArrow moves the cursor to the end of the line, aka End. Doesn't solve your problem of wanting to use those keys, but at least you'll know.thats true @steve moser, but I thought it gave a different error message than that one?The problem is you get used to using home and end.Thanks - I saw table 3 of http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries and was amazed that they quote only 4% annual loss if the battery is at 40% charge instead of 20 % annual loss 100% charge at 25C. Makes sense why service batteries are usually 50% or less.I agree uninstalling flash is great for battery life when browsing the web (and having google chrome around for when you need it - but quitting the app elsewhise) but for airplane use of movie playback - quitting the browser will save all the CPU unless you are on wifi playing flash games...I think this behaviour is by design. I've just learned to work around it.Thanks, good to know. Thanks for the link.+1 on the FLAC information. It's not worth the hassle for me, but for many the idea of a free format is very appealing. I'll write up an Apple Lossless answer in case someone finds the FLAC less optimal - I don't see any discussion on syncing to iOS or airplay of flac but assume it's included?With some nasty workaround it's even possible have the same library on multiple systems.So how do you work around it?I agree. I continue to mis-press them after using a Mac almost exclusively for the last 18 months.The question was "any ideas?", so... yes, this is an answer. Anyway, it was more helpful than your comment... ;)(1) What kind of certificates can I create ? (2) What about my visibility as developer? If they subscribe with their name, I don't appear in the results right ?(3) Is easy to transfer apps from one account to another ? Do they need to be deleted and re-submitted (and all comments, ratings lost..) ? (4) yeah iTunes Connect sales/download information is a good reason to make them subscribe(1) Certificates are used for the development process. You have to have an active developer certificate installed in order to test on a device (as opposed to just the iOS Simulator). (2) The only details searchable (as far as I know) are App name and Company name. (3) You cannot transfer apps between accounts. You would have to delete yours and re-list them under your customers' name, or vice versa. (4) Absolutely.(1) Ok. If they create their accounts can I easily submit the apps for them without having to deal with their private information such as passwords - credit card info (they don't have technical knowledge. (2) If they add the apps with their subscription do I have some visibility ? let's say if someone search for my name on the app store, can he still see my apps ?That's odd. The location icon on the settings screen only denotes that the app has used your location in the last 24 hours. It does not (necessarily) mean it has a standing location update. Though that might be the case with apps such as Google Latitude. Regardless it's not necessarily noted by the icon alone. This probably means also that if you double clicked the home button and killed all apps in the multitasking menu that your input speed would improve too.@Patrick Developer certificates for digitally signing the apps. You're correct that if someone searches for your name/company name in the store then those apps won't show up as yours, but that's appropriate for apps that aren't actually yours. Doesn't mean you couldn't link to them from your website app portfolio or what have you, especially if your clients agree in advance. I do see that you're using the word "collaborate" instead of "contract" -- if these really are co-creations then do whatever you want. If it's work for hire, though, in my opinion the apps should be under their names.@Patrick As I noted in my answer, it's basically impossible to transfer apps from one account to another intact. Yes, you'd have to delete them and resubmit, and you can't even use the same name, so basically they're non-transferrable.(1) After they pay for the account, they should be able to designate you as an "Agent". You should then be able to generate certificates, access iTunes connect, and really do anything except manage billing or delete the entire account (though you will be able to delete apps). (2) See my comment on Matthew Frederick's answer. An app will only show the company (or individual) name on the ADC account itself. Not individual developer names inside of that.Why not use Handbrake itself to one-step rip the DVD into a Video file? Does MtR do something that Handbrake does not?I use CCC mainly because I found it first and it worksHave you tried the same SIM in a friends phone where the internet usually works? Worth a try.yes, that's the reason of why it's being slow. But is there anyway to improve? Is there a tweak somewhere to decrease the dragging wait time? I like this feature and don't want to move things around using more than 1 fingers! As far as I remember, it did not behave like this on a PC laptop..Define turning off. Do you mean lock the iPhone but leave the screen on?

What is the use case for this?Yes, I got a passcode lock set up and I was expecting that it will not let anybody(thieves for example) turn it off unless the correct code is entered. Basically if the phone gets turned off, it cant be tracked anymore so chances of getting it back are close to 0.You should ask *rmit tech support* that they send you what they did on your computer (the exact step-by-step) and post it here.There has to be a script that's executing a "say" command.This question has almost nothing to do with Mac, almost all current distributions will run well enough in VirtualBox.

Actually it work normal before i installed paragon ntfs driver...@chan I've added an answer that will most possibly solve your problem but I can't find a reason to whyit's behaving like that in the first place, yet.yes I have growl installedNo, it's not an answer. It doesn't directly answer the question. It would be much better as a comment. Maybe this? Maybe that? That's a comment.@chan i've updated my answer, it may or may not work, but it sure is simpler than uninstalling it.It would be interesting to see if the folder is really in your sidebar or if the Paragon NTFS is injecting the folder systematically. User added folders can be deleted and do not reappear. Have you tried booting in safe mode (shift key held down) to try disabling the paragon software?I think that the URL `m.google.com` is a special mobile device service - the same applies to `m.hotmail.com` where you can get an IMAP service on a mobile device - but not on a desktop mail client (Hotmail doesn't normally support IMAP).how is this answer useful? sorry but anybody knows how to fix this problem? I too cant search for text in my messages or emails. use to be the most effective function i used. it only brings up the messages after the upgrade evn though the messages are still in the same folder. There must be a fix to allow search for all contents (not just the contecnts after the upgrade)
please help!
s@mankoff: There are a lot of questions related to issues surrounding iTunes libraries on external drives, but none that I could find that discuss how to actually set it up. If you can find it, and it is indeed the same question, then we can reasonably close it. Otherwise, a citation is needed here.You forgot that I need to sync contacts from at least **two** google accounts (see them as different addressbooks). This is the essential part of the question, because this would enable me to move contacts, one by one between a personal gmail account and a corporate one.sms travels over a command channel unused by voice, voice can be active and data not provisioned. Have you informed  your carrier that data you are paying for isn't working and have their tech verify that dataplan is actually active on their wireless network for your SIM?I'll add three options - since the unix heritage of Mac OS X is different than the NT architecture - the tools don't overlap perfectly. Are you looking for an API to program or just tools to peek at what is currently happening (or trigger actions after a certain file changes)I *may* have found my answer. I read online that channels 1-4 are somewhat restricted in Israel (where I am right now). I switched it to channel 11 and it seems to work so far ...this is what I found online and have been getting an error which deals with 64 bit arch. I found a solution though: arch -i386 osascript  -e 'tell application "iTunes" to updateAllPodcasts' Thanks for the help! Cron works just fine for me =)thanks for the help but I figured out a solution =)for anyone with errors using the solution see this article to fix them: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/516/cpsid_51615.htmlThank you Tricon, it seems to have worked!Thank you for sharing ScriptSaver! I was looking for the same thing and this just does it!That's your answer. I've found that generally channels 5-11 will work in most of the world for 802.11b/g/n (just checked Wikipedia and it indicates the same: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels )I'd guess Google is paying for license to active sync only to mobile users and not desktop users. There's no technical reason why the iOS can handle multiple contact lists from multiple gmail accounts and the Mac desktop client cannot so it's more a speculation as to **"why not?"** and less a **"how to?"**. The same **"why not?"** speculation goes for Apple and multiple google accounts within Address Book.Nope. This is the correct answer. You are asking to do something that is no longer possible. It is like being annoyed that you asked the question "How do I fly by flapping my arms?" and someone says "It doesn't work like that." If you downgrade your device you can probably return search functionality, but it was disabled in 4.0 because it caused unacceptable slowdown in devices.Sorry, I forgot the title. You could probably use some external service like [Soocial](http://www.soocial.com/). The free plan allows only one Gmail, but I guess that you could sync Address Book to one Gmail directly and then Soocial connects your Mac to the other Gmail.don't worry, Time machine takes care of that every hour to an external drive.been an AIX support technician for 3 years ... 12 years ago :) know some stuff but the simple stuff had vanished from my head :)Thanks for the info guys I will just make sure it is charged up befor I go away and just turn it off and leave it in the draw..I was going to snark my answer with friendly manual and google suggestions but quickly deleted it after reading your bio.

I'm not sure if this changed in iOS4 but this always saves it to my phone rather than gmail's contacts.If reseting the fonts back to default don't do anything, I would suggest just uninstalling and reinstalling Chrome. Serif fonts are not the default, that's for sure.You can use alt+cmd+H too, without having to move the mouseThese are "emacs" keybindings used by libreadline, and they're almost all available in any text box widget in OSXJust tried it, but although the clock etc. disappear for a second, the menubar still stays black.It's a very natural request - but it goes against the engineering that went into making an alias different than a link.@Harv - very good suggestion at first glance.

Hang in there - you'll know how these things work before long. Next up is getting help from Apple in person or over the internet to work through the potential device issues. Good Luck!Glad I could help!Can you boot into single user mode? Even if you have to run this mac in target mode and run the installer from another mac. (preferably the same or newer vintage MacPro) you should be able to get a single user mode boot to know the most basic drivers are working.does your iphone have a case/screen protector etc. which covers the proximity sensor?Yes.  During reinstall of xcode (originally thought this was problem), CPU temp spiked to 109 deg C before fans kicked in, but then crashed when temp hit 117.  This has been happening to me since installing Snow.  Guess a fan, temp sensor or something went bad.  Can confirm that after forcing fans on when temp goes above 70 C, I can install without a prob.BTW - Also had to keep fans running after install cause md5 / Indexing.So I trust you mean something like [choosy](http://www.choosyosx.com/), but for iphone. Good luck with that! ;)This did help me find "my" problem.  See edit of question and comments below.As I said I already have it set to weekly. I'm looking for more specific control over the day and time. Thanks for the link; I'll look at the link when I have a few minutes to process it - I've never worked with AppleScript.I just read the article and set up an agent using Lingon as suggested. Simple and easy; just need to see if it actually runs tomorrow! Thanks.@Unsliced - Fantastic!  I would take a really good look at why console.app doesn't work (and what else might not be working).  Weird issues like that, while they might not seem terribly significant ("So, I can't see the logs.  So what?") may point to a bigger problem.  Rooting  it out is important, if you want a healthy Mac.  What about my question about migration?Yeah, no Task Manager in Safari, and it doesn't appear that the tabs run as separate processes: the system Activity Monitor shows many processes for Chrome when it has multiple open tabs but just one for Safari when it has multiple open tabs.@Harv when the HDD died, I did a restore (from Carbonite) so while it was a form of migration, it wasn't using Migration Assistant.@bmike i've updated the question with more infoi've updated the question with more infoIt should not be overlooked that the MS and Logitech options have a different layout than the standard Mac keypad; the plus key is oversized, there's no equals key, and the slash, star and minus keys are in different positions, as per the standard PC keyboard layout.

The date of the event is still one year off (in the future).Just for completion: they're both not free ;)One thing that I might try is using the OSX boot disk to run diskutil, which I think can disable journaling. Then from what I have read Linux should be able to mount the drive as writable.Thanks, that got me close, then "mount -o update /" to make the mount writable was the final step!Single user mode was the solution. I had tried Safe Mode earlier and when that didn't work I gave up on boot tricks thinking it was the lowest level I could boot in to. Thanks again Michael!It doesn't open it. It says 'You need to install the UniConvertor software. For GNU/Linux: install the package python-uniconvertor.' How can I install it under Mac OS X?Cool! I imagine at least some drivers have to load for this to work, though?Not sure about drivers, but the OS doesn't load so your changes to /etc/launchctl.conf won't get the chance to break anything.@NR4TR Ugh, unfortunately the solution to that appears to be somewhat difficult and still might not solve the problem, especially if the .cdr file has any text in it. See answer #2 here: https://answers.launchpad.net/inkscape/+question/90463Many terminal scripts and unix commands use `0` as the exit status to indicate that they ran successfully. Is it possible that you've somehow ended up redirecting the output from shell scripts or unix commands to empty files? I know I end up with misdirected output occasionally. Are they ending up in your home folder?@NR4TR The only other options I know of are to have someone or some service convert the file for you. Google reveals quite a number of websites that either provide it as an online service (though they seem somewhat shaky to me) or as a manual service -- basically you pay someone to open it in Corel Draw and export it for you. The Python package problem you ran into apparently popped up a few years ago. Wish I had a better suggestion for you.In that case I'd suggest selecting the Growl preference, the Applications from the tab row. Then check each Application listed to see if it uses 'Display Option' 'Speech'. Start with 'hardwaregrowler' or similar.Agreed, as long as it's the same iTunes/Apple account the in-app purchase will be free.

You should have an ip address, PDP Type of "IP" and access point name iPhone@Garrett You raise a good point.  Many (most?) people use keypads by touch, so even small variations in what someone is used to could lead to problems.@bitbonk I believe iPhoto events take their dates from the photos they contain, so double-check to make sure *all* photos have the correct date.  If you're still having trouble, that's not strictly on-topic for this particular question (you asked about photos, not events), so I'd recommend creating a new question.Qik is the best app i have come across for broadcasting live video.I've re-installed Chrome many many times and it doesn't help. As I've also already said, I also have cleaned out all caches (and similar stuff) manually after uninstalling. No change in behavior. A newly installed Chrome always show that horrible serif font.(It's the Mid-2010 Single CPU 2.8 GHz Model if it matters)@bmike my carrier is SGP-M1-3GSM. I don't know about the version / modem firmware (where is it shown?). I've connected to ITunes to put some songs in but I don't know if i did (or how to) update the iphone software. When i call 3001#12345# i get "Error performing request No Network Service"@Unsliced - the best suggestion I have for you is, separate out your data from applications.  Do a clean erase/install, and start fresh with a new system, new fully updated system, and new preferences everywhere.  Make sure you bring over stuff like your old Keychain, Mail, Mail Downloads, and all of the folders that are important, such as Desktop, Documents, etc.  Install apps from disk/internet/whatever.  Clean, fresh slate.I have a Windows installed via Bootcamp, so it seems that the best way is to install Corel there...I see.. but you know, Matlab is though to install and then I've to code.. it is a bit though solution. I have a table in excel/Numbers with these values, it would be great to just copy paste this table and generate the graph...Any tiny software doing that by just adding values to a table ?You are correct regarding the new ones. The previous 27" models, the ones without Thunderbolt, could utilize their Mini-DP as an input.@Patrick Of course, I was surprised that I couldn't find something in a quick google search. But I guess diagrams like this aren't mainstream enough for specialised software, so you have to use mathematics stuff.Uhm, the software you suggest is more for draw analytical functions... etc in 2D and 3D. I don't see the option to draw histograms given a set of values.@romeovs I might be wrong but I can't see 3d histograms in Gnuplot as well.I tried, but I just get a new line when I press enter after it.I believe just launching the app is enough for the launch services to notice where the app is located. So launch the installer and quit it. Failed move upon entering a password is strange.Accepted. But is there an app? I'm willing to take no for an answer if there isn't. With iOS 4, you can easily move files from machine to device app (eg: VLC app to play vids); so if there's an app, I'd like that.The only other option I can think of is to buy an "Office editing" app such as Documents to Go; these should let sync via iTunes.  However, this will probably cost you $10 or so and have clunkier syncing than just getting a free Dropbox account and using their iOS app as the viewer.  For your purposes, I don't think it's worth it.Have never seen choosy, will have to install that now thanks!  But yea that's the same idea as what I'm thinkingWhat is listening on port 8080? It is an address commonly used for web servers when the usual HTTP port 80 is unavailable. If it is a web server, you need to send a complete HTTP request, finished by two newlines (return characters, really). Normally, as explained by Laas below, a newline will trigger the sending of a line.I agree with all that, but I'd add we should [request Apple](http://www.apple.com/support/feedback/) to take [some measures](http://goo.gl/NiEdU) to **help** preventing theft - iPhone does have a near 100% way of preventing official unlock so it should be possible to also achieve good results for fighting robbery if they really wanted to.yep it was via growl, there was a program 'marco polo' i didn't even know i had installed using growl to indicate it was switching locations.Thanks for the confirmation on that. One thing I've noticed is that if I don't wake up the system until I get it back into the network range, it seems to pick up where it left of with no corruption problems. So if I'm correct about that, there ought be a (relatively) simple way to "suspend" the backup until the disk becomes available again.Why not just install both? You have two optical drive slots.@emempe There are options that allow you to only route specific traffic over VPN.  You have to adjust your routing table (man route) to do so.  Some of this is done automatically when you establish your VPN connection.  If your home network is in 192.168.1.0/24 space and the network you VPN into is in 10.0.0.0/8 space, all traffic destined to 10/8 is automatically sent over the VPN. All other traffic would go to your default route. This is the split in split-tunnel.  Traffic can go to 192 or to 10.  Without split tunnel traffic only goes to 10 (via the VPN)I wish all programs implemented this key combination consistently. Evernote decided they needed to be "special" and use Cmd + Shift + V for paste-without-style. Grrrr.I would vote this up 10 times if I could.It is worth adding that Time Machine support from anyone other than Apple is unofficial, and there's no guarantee that it won't break in future versions of MacOS.Thanks David, this is great stuff. I'm a little worried about noise: does the LaCie have a fan of any kind?There's no fan; LaCie uses solid metal cases to utilize conductive cooling.Can you tell us what you have in System Preferences -> Network -> Ethernet -> DNS Server? (you can try the OpenDNS there: 208.67.222.222) (http://www.opendns.com/) (it's free). Or Google's own DNS: 8.8.8.8I tried adding google's DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 - But upon clicking Apply, everything got set back to the automatic configuration.could you post a sshot of your network settings please?"... it will _not_ work over a network." - really? Lots of other people seem to be doing so; eg, from Wikipedia: "For backups to a network drive, Time Machine allows the user to back up Apple Macintosh computers through Apple's AirPort networking, and supports backing up to normal network attached storage devices or servers", or this: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080420211034137If it can be done via a shell script, yes, otherwise probably, depends... Can you supply the way this driver option is done normally?And from the Western Digital website: "*Compatible with Apple Time Machine*. Mac computer users can utilize all the features of Apple Time Machine backup software to protect their data. Back up all your Macs wirelessly to one location over your WiFi network." That seems pretty unambiguous...@RobZolkos The split seemed successful but I couldn't get unzip to work (or even Archive Utility).This is called Quick Look and is already posted: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks/573#573It is Option/Alt key, not Shift.+1 for qik, the first and still best for broadcasting video... But there will be no voice chat with it. Maybe, and just maybe, we can multitask the phone, skype or something at same time, if we're lucky and there's enough 3G for it.Thanks Nathan. That does the trick perfectly. I've just altered the line to read: `export PAGER="col -b  | open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app -f"` so it'll open in Chrome instead of Safari.This function wasn't working for me Graham. Not sure why.I'd been wanting to do this for myself anyway, and I'm glad I finally found time to look into it. I used TextWrangler with the command `/usr/bin/edit --view-top --clean -t "Man page"`Cheers. That does look interesting, esp. "We just threw in some color, some bold headers and cleaned it up a bit, so they go easy on the eye." I wonder if I can get such functionality from further editing a .conf file?That is exactly what I wanted. So it is possible.Is Google Chrome in `/Applications/` or somewhere else?To be fair, you can plug in a monitor that supports Mini DisplayPort.Very true.  I have mine plugged into a 27" Cinema Display.  I just felt like I was mislead into thinking I would be able to use Thunderbolt to connect 2 displays and an external drive to the port. (It's coming soon)I disagree with the last sentence. If you lose physical access to your phone, there's pretty much nothing able to be done to completely lock out an intruder. If there were, the rate of bricked phones would raise substantially. Also, Aapple did something. They give Find My iPhone out for free to all iPhone 4 owners.Do you have to use the Cisco client? While I haven't used the AnyConnect client, I did use the Cisco VPN Client and had kernel panics with it. I switched to using the built-in VPN client over a year ago and haven't had a kernel panic since then.While this may disable indexing, those files and directories will still be present on the volume (which is the annoying part in the first place), and if you delete them .Spotlight* and .fseventd will come back. In fact, .metadata_never_index is one *more* entry in the file listing than the usual cruft.It's in `/Applications/`.As a hint for the "friends that don't use their full name in their Facebook profile" -- sometimes the syncing works if you add an e-mail-address to their contact that they've provided in their Facebook profile.I have the same issue, images synced to the Address Book from Facebook app are very small.@Davide: Then upvote the question? `;-)`Apple never had physical access to any phone on the carrier lock issue. True, jailbreaking exists and it "solves" it but not exactly by removing the lock they did. Find My iPhone is only good for devices not purposely stolen. That and nothing is the same on this scenario. If the thief knows just a little bit on what he is doing, which is keeping the phone off until bringing to someone who knows better, I still think that bricking the phone (forget the data) would be the best solution and I given our current technology believe it could be done if they really wanted to.I still don't understand what a shell-script is exactly. But it's my own fault, I can't sit thru tutorials so suffer thru learing via trial and error after error.The driver option is the monitor calibration setting, controling which display the tablet is mapped to. In this case it's a cintiq, so it is naturally the primary display. But when it is switched to the other display, the cursor jumps to that that display,an action that is almost identical to the Display Toggle function. Which is what I've been trying to replicate as a keyboard shortcut since getting my cintiq. It's become an obsession.FYI, I did a little looking on this and couldn't find anything. Even if you create an account with no credit card it'll still prompt for a username and password when downloading a free app. Someone could use the username and password to fiddle with the account later. Apple uses special "house accounts" in their stores that do exactly what you're looking for, but I don't know how to emulate that.a shell script is a way to encapsulate one or several lines of commands (probably not the best definition, but summing up, it is a way to send simple (and complex) commands to your system). Your request may be simpler to accomplish with some app. that allows you to add shortcuts to common actions. You could try Buttler, (http://manytricks.com/butler/ version 4.1.6 is free), or even at the system prefs you have a way to add shortcuts, at the keyboard & mouse prefs.Reality begs to differ if you actually have two Thunderbolt ports (27" iMac): http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/03/apple-imac-hands-on-with-dual-30-inch-displays-video/ Now if someone released a monitor that actually chained correctly...Thanks for the Documents 2 Go suggestion. There is a free version that's good enoughSyncing google calendars with iCal is two-way in my setup (standard google setup in iCal) - why is it only one-way in your setup ??In iCal I subscribed to the .ical link in the sharing settings of my Google calendar, then from iCal I can't "write" an event in that calendar. Does that work for you ?@Larsen: Wow ! I'm sooo stupid. I never realized I can add a Google account using CalDav from iCal ... I learned something...@Rene Larsen: do you also see the calendars shared by someone else in individual lines (under the title "delegates") ? That's a bit annoying.I haven't heard of any security advisory. Do you have a source for this?I could not uncheck the "locked" option, but the "sudo" worked. ThanksYes, I can see my other Calendars - and Shared too under the delegates setting on my account i iCal. And they'll then be shown in iCal if I set a check mark next to them.And as a side note to the sharing stuff - the way I share a calendar is under "Share with specific people", and then I give it "Make changes AND manage sharing" permissions - and I've then disabled (removed the check mark) "Share this calendar with others".If the calendar you are sharing doesn't have write permission then you'll only be able to view it (read only) - which also will be shown in the delegates settings.I have write permission on one of my shared calendar, but yet it appears in delegates. It looks like only your own google calandar (the first one) really belongs to you.Yes, that's right - delegates isn't 'your' Calendars. If you want to have more 'of your own' Calendars, then create a new under your Google calendar, then they'll be placed next to your main calendar.guys my problem is solvedOK, thanks ! One more question: did you manage to create one new "your own" google calendar from iCal ?No this is not possible - you can only create local "On My Mac" Calendars with iCal.Thanks for the suggestion! Tried it but the web player (not the iOS app) was crashing Chrome and SafariI've just tried to create a new Calendar under my own Google Cal., and it was also shown under "Delegates" - so this means that it will only be the main Calendar that will go on the top level, and all other (shared and your own created) under "Delegates". The one I created my self got Read/Write permissions by default, so it is a two-way. The shared Calendars need to be set to (as I also wrote above) "Make changes AND manage sharing" - otherwise they only become one-way.I uncheck the first checkbox but its still show the .apiBut you still have the Calendars shown separately, so what is the benefit of it ?? If we are talking about shared calendars, then you don't always have the necessarily account informations - which you only have for your own calendars.It may be that the scaling code is the same or similar; the difference is just more obvious with the iPad because each individual pixel is bigger and therefore more noticable.@Nathan: I doubt that. One of the most noticeable things is text. On a scaled iPhone app, it is blurry, while on an iPad app, the same text is perfectly crisp.I have the same question. There is www.iphonedevsdk.com, which has an active community, but the signal to noise is not what you'd expect from Stackoverflow.@Cajun I use the optical drive so rarely that I don't see the point in using power and generating noise if I know I'll never need it. Just want to make sure not to run into issues in the future. I'm just trying it now, will see if I encounter software that doesn't work w/o an official SUperdrive.Can you make this answer a little more complete? Tell us about these apps, your experience with them, and how much they cost. Thanks.Panic did it all right with Prompt.That might be the case, but I still hope they fix it in 5.0Wow, I can't believe I missed this. Thanks!Plus many for prompt. It is superbMany apple stores are set up for a rapid net install restore that takes 5 to 25 minutes based on load and your mac's speed. Also, ordering replacement media may be less expensive than the retail DVD.The nice thing about mac os x is apps can typically run from anywhere.  It's best for sanity to put them in the application folders (system and or user) but not strictly required.very true.  In my case, I'd be so desperate to get going again, I'd be busting down the doors of my Apple store than waiting for a shipment :)@Daniel, can you post a screenshot of what you have.  @Am1rr3zA's answer is correct.  But in your question you state .app and in your comment .api    I think you are trying to hide file extensions, which is what was answered above.try terminal us "rm -rf folder-name"I know this. I were actually asking whether I can automatically create alias for the folder by just holding some key while dragging or smth like that. It could be much more efficient than constantly clicking right mouse button then 'create alias'No need to restart; you just need to relaunch the apps in question.@Ivan: Ah, the app is listed as installed only when the external disk is attached. It did not notify me of the update, but maybe that is a periodic check?I ran into a similar problem with Xcode. Unfortunately, it stuck even after disconnecting the monitor and I had to reinstall Xcode. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6079590/xcode-4-source-editor-not-displaying-text-properly/6088426#6088426That's a pretty good idea. I do have little snitch already, it's just been in log (no prompt) mode for some time. I'll give that a shot.At the height of my frustration, I had chrome, safari, and firefox attempting to reach google. All of them eventually timed out.That sucks man.What does it say under the "Audio" section in System Profiler? If nothing, try booting with your restore DVD and open System Profiler on that and check that.More Generally, you can't add plugins to MobileSafari without jailbreaking.I assume you've tried the usual restart?did I mention it's an imac g3, it can't handle os x, that's why I got debian, it's the only operating system that would be relatively easy and could run on it@Luck The iMac G3 can officially handle up to Mac OS X 10.3, and there are ways of installing 10.4 on thereThe Apple Way(tm) is to use `sudo` to run commands that require elevated privileges, not to switch to a root shell and work from that.I prefer mac os x over linux, don't get me wrong, but were can I find a 10.3 mac os x install disc@Luck You could try [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0000E6NK9/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&condition=used) or [eBay](http://computers.shop.ebay.com/Operating-Systems-/80258/i.html?_nkw=mac+os+x+10.3&_catref=1&_fln=1&_trksid=p3286.c0.m282)I would boot from the restore disc and run an apple hardware test. This can be done by holding down the 'D' key while booting the DVD. You can fine more info about it here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509Thanks so much!You could use CCC even if its not a complete drive/partition.I have tried to copy (non-supported) TM volumes, but it always refused to continue to use the new drive. Every time I have resorted to just doing full backup to new drive and holding on to my old drive for a while, until sufficient history has built up on new drive (a week or two).IMO, this is by far the best way to sync contacts on the iPhone. +1I find the snow leopard built-in client to be much better - had a variety of issues with the Cisco one including kernel panics. No bother at all since switching, and much faster to connect.Agreed, seamless two-way syncing of my Google calendar and contact info. More than two-way, really, as I also use it to sync with my iPad. Don't forget that you do have to ***enable Google Sync**, as explained in the article @Peter linked to.Can you give more information about "iPhone Lite"? Is it an app? I'm having trouble finding why it should belong on this site. ("iPhone Lite" only yield new iPhones rumors on Google)Thx for you helpGreat, so at least it's sorted-out now:) Happy surfing.@Ian C. - No, that's actually the unix way. Apple just uses it because it is *nix based too.`sudo su` still works, so it is not really disabled. It just has no password.Thanks!  Unfortunately, the .plist file is not found on my system.  Any reason that you can think of ?  I'm running 10.6.7.Please explain something in the text and give information what the links are - as I assume blank links etc are to virus, phishing etc@Fake Name: Apple goes through great pains to never talk or expose the root shell to users. You could say they take the `sudo` ethos to the extreme. But whatever: semantics. Don't use root shells in OS X.This sounds exactly like [M1's iPhone lite plan](http://www.m1.com.sg/iPhone/plans.html), in which is coincidentally my carrier too.i can't seem to get it working. its linked already but my contacts are still the same.. I can't see the screen at http://www.google.com/help/hc/images/mobile_138740i_keep_content_en.gif@Loic Wolff its the iphone lite planwhat do you mean that my iphone warns me about its temperature?[this picture](http://dailymobile.se/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/iphone_temperature_warning.jpg) says it all.OK, thanks. But still, even if it's a iPhone-related phone plan, it has nothing to do on this site since it's about a phone provider.I don't see it anywhere in mine, and I haven't see that for a long time now.But isn't that just the stand alone Cisco VPN Clint that doesn't work in 64-bit mode - the build-in VPN Client should work AFAIKWhat is the output of 'env' in your terminal? Looks like your environment is picking up the built-in version of libcurl first (/usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib), which is used by /usr/bin/curl, whereas the fink version of curl really wants something newer (presumably from /usr/local/lib). If so, I'm not sure why it's not just ignoring the first, too-old version that it finds, though.Agree, sounds to me like the drive is failing. Sadly, SSD drives don't seem to have a great lifespan, as yet:  http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.htmlWhat is the make and model of the car stereo? Unfortunately not all Bluetooth car stereos are equal; they don't all support the part of the Bluetooth protocol that supports streaming audio. (I'm guessing you already know that and you're asking if there's an app to circumvent that issue, but it might still be helpful to know.)@Calum - I've added the output to the end of my question. Cheers.@Calum Oh, and interestingly, if I run `/usr/bin/curl` I get the same error. Looks like the version in /usr/lib isn't right either!Hmm, probably needs more of a Unix-head to step in at this point! As a matter of interest, what does '/usr/bin/curl --version' show? It should show v7.19.7, for OS X 10.6.7.

You might also want to try temporarily unsetting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, just to see what happens -- I always try not to set it unless I really need it for the job at hand, as it can cause this sort of issue too.@Calum Ah - great! Unsetting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH seemed to do the trick. Thanks. Do you want to put that as an answer so I can upvote it and mark it as accepted?Thanks. To be honest, I haven't tried this yet, but it seems like the best solution.  I started using the Opera Browser.I dount this is Fink as Fink installs in /sw not /usr/local. /usr/local would be for installs direct from source or other direct installs - I also note /opt/local/bin which is usually macports - only use one ports as they aren't tested with others (given that path have you used homebrew for anything as that could be the source of curl)@Ian C - Apple doesn't do much more than the \*nix designers do, Apple just doesn't talk about it much. In both cases, it's there, only with things like linux, they tell you how to use it easily. If that makes it more widely *used*, it doesn't indicate an underlying architecture difference.The hardware seems to be good enough for Snow Leopard. Perhaps it has something to do with the installation media. Are you using an original installation DVD?I should revise my answer a little bit. The point I was hoping to make (as I state on the very next paragraph from the one you quoted me from) is that using a Time Capsule is the only official method. By that, I mean that is the one way you could achieve a network backup out-of-the-box using the regular UI on System Preferences.'Operation not permitted'Yea I already knew that. It's called A2DP by the way and yea I'm looking for an app to fix this limitation.That's so sad :(Unfortunately, the Bamboo prefs doesn't have any pressure meter like that.@Nathan I updated the answer with the screen short for the Bamboo.  It doesn't have the pressure meter but gives instructions on how to set the sensitivity.haha thanks! Indeed its one of my favourites too. I use it all the time!btw i've got another question. in Singapore we have this ezlink-card scanner which we scan our ez-link card against whenever we enter the MRT. I always hold my phone and wallet together in 1 hand so i was wondering will there be any issues if the iphone gets "scanned" alongside the ez-link card?If this is possible, it might require VBA coding. Should this maybe be migrated to Stack Overflow? Will flag it.Is the path case sensitive or insensitive? I can access Library by cd ~/library, but the tab method won't work if i got case wrong.@colinfang OS X is case insensitive, but case-preserving. The bash shell must be a bit more discriminating when it comes to autocomplete.@NReilingh - Aha, thx.@colinfang: You can use `shopt -s nocaseglob` and `bind 'set completion-ignore-case on'` to make *bash* less sensitive to case.Thanks. I'm using -- or was using -- the built-in client.Thanks. I had been using the built-in client along with running the 64-bit kernel for about 6 months now w/o any problems.Also, some variables come from *launchd* (e.g. TMPDIR, SHELL, HOME, USER, LOGNAME, SSH_AUTH_SOCK, DISPLAY, Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render), *Terminal* (e.g. TERM, TERM_PROGRAM, TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION, COMMAND_MODE) and *bash* itself (PWD, SHLVL).nice answer @Chris.  How did you get the Tab characters to look like keys?@RobZ: It is the `<kbd></kbd>` HTML tag (one of several [HTML tags supported in SE markdown](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1777/what-html-tags-are-allowed-on-stack-overflow-server-fault-and-super-user)).thanks.  much appreciated.OK - that wasn't clear in your question - I assume you've rebooted and problem is still there? Occassionally the vpn process (racoon) gets in a state where it won't connect, but either killing the process or restarting fixes that. Have you looked at the logs - filter on 'racoon' in the system log in console.Worked like a charm! Thanks!Edited answer to include some logs. I've recently moved to a country with no Apple Stores so asking a genius isn't really possible for a few months. I was hoping there might be somewhere inside I could poke around, find out if the closed sensor is magnetic or mechanical and if so could it have failed or become stuck?nmb isn't in OSX's resolver by default. Though someone else will have to elaborate, because much of this stuff STILL eludes me.Instead of straight migrating the question, I suggest you rewrite it and post it as a new post on SO so it's clearly a programming question, otherwise it'll likely be tossed back here or SU.I believe what you want to do is to make the linux machine announce itself using [mDNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking#Name_resolution). But then it's not a Mac question anymore, but a Linux question.@Harald Post that as an answer and I'll accept (it works now).Great. Even though it may be off topic, would you mind briefly telling us what you did to solve it?On the Linux box: sudo apt-get install avahi-daemonThanks, after executing "sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon" on the Linux machine, the Mac can now see it as fry.local.@Kyle - Okay, will do.Can you clarify this a little? From that scree cap, it looks like you've got a bunch of integers that add up to way more than 100%. 100%=100/100=1. Unless the columns add up to one, the sum will not be 100%. Can you clarify what you're trying to achieve; I must be missing something?You might try looking under the Windows preferences to see if there's a setting that automatically disables the trackpad when a mouse is plugged in.colinfang - For a case insensitive tab completion with bash compatibility try 'zsh'. Also the wildcard completion of this shell is very good.@Nathan uhm. Each column has a different sum, so for column1, 100% can be a value, and for column2 100% can be another value. It doesn't have to be the same value... actually it was better if I posted just a column of values.So, in conclusion, I probably need to sum all values and divide them by the sum and those are the percentage. Probably I don't need a number function.. but if you know a faster solution....@Parcerier, on the Contact app, do you have a "Groups" button on the top left? If so, click on it then you'll see the Gmail contacts group.@Pacerier: the screenshot you want to see: http://i.stack.imgur.com/55QQL.gif@Loic Wolff I mean i can't navigate my iphone such that i can see that screen in my iphone..how do i go to that screen. i go settings > mail, contacts, calendars > GMail > and I'm stuck thereOWC GRant was wrong, as can be seen in OWC's later blog post reporting that HDDFanControl does workThat's because you added a Gmail account. You must add an **Exchange**, like Peter told you. Then you'll be able to sync contacts"Sum all values and divide them by the sum" what do you mean by that? Take the sum and divide by itself? That will give you 100%, but I don't know why you would want to do this since it's the same as just typing 1 in the cell...Does this relate to AppleScript?Thanks for the information. I remember seeing the + icon and forgot about it entirely. I'll have to check my apps to see how many of them have it.Your mac is still supported online and via phone in the country of purchase. You can call in a report and ask for your service options. Although you have isolated the issue almost perfectly to the sleep sensor, Apple is still available to help you with repair options. Depending on the exact model, it is a small reed switch or other magnetic sensor. http://iFixit.com might have part numbers if you want to learn more.The only "hidden payment" that could be added is sales tax if your state requires it.@NReilingh Good point, or country tax, like a VAT.On duplicate names, Apple's very responsive to taking down clones when they're pointed out by the original developer, much more so than in the Android Market (where it can be nearly impossible to find the original of some apps).Wish I knew. I keep a bit of removable tape over mine just in case (though that's more for situations where I might accidentally turn the camera on, like during a Skype call).Could you post an example? Be sure the phone's not moving, even a little bit, when you take the picture - the easiest way is to stand it up along the metal edge.One can abuse the `defaults` command to get the bundle identifier: e.g. `defaults read /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info CFBundleIdentifier` (all on one line, in Terminal) will return `com.apple.Safari`.+1 Hi nreilingh, thanks for your response. No, different network. Logmein claims itmsupports this feature. You access throughh the web interface and then it's supposed to wake the machine up... Doesn't seem to be working thoughI'll post the obvious-but-it-can't-hurt-to-check question: is the lens clean?Although this is technically on-topic since it relates to connecting the iPad to a computer, it would be a much better fit for [Ask Different](http://askdifferent.com), the Apple Stack Exchange site. If you would like me to migrate it there, please flag it for moderator attention saying so.It was a combination of this option and setting the remote display size to be a 16:9 aspect ratio in preferences that finally did it for me.And yeah, I know about `displayed name`, but that can include the extension (depending on the user's configuration).To add to the list: Are you focusing correctly? Are you using the HDR mode? Also, do the shots look blurry on the screen or just after you've taken them?he said *Google as Exchange* meaning **Microsoft Exchange**. Go ahead, that's the one.Added screenshots to explain a bit further.You see, that first screenshot is all that I see, except with no `Edit` button. There is no scroll down beyond *other*. It just bounces back.That's... very strange. And the labels match *exactly*?That's the strangest part - they change. I never pay much attention, but sometimes they change. Right now I've got `mobile, home, work, home fax, work fax, pager, assistant, car, company man, radio`... So, wtf car and radio? Anyway, it never bothered me enough to seek for a solution.Sounds like you're touching different label types.Either way, labels should always be the same, shouldn't they?@Nathan: No, but I took the broader reading of the question "There are smart folders, folder actions, and other applescripts, as far as I know. 
As I haven't come across a good tutorial, or some other resource for these new capabilities within OSX, I was wondering if people could give a couple real-life examples of how they are using these." Feel free to flag my post for deletion if you want though. I wasn't sure myself.you may want to look [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1434) and see if there is an apple authorized service provider near youHaven't tested yet, but if that works, sick.A valid point. As Smart Folders aren't AppleScript, I assume the autor is interested in general automation. I've edited the title to reflect that.@hobs : It works, I checked that.I'm pretty sure there is an environment variable that controls ls's color options. That would be the better thing to change@Nathan: OK, that makes sense to me.Useful hints to go along with this: (1) Right click in the thumbnail view and select `columns -> 2` to display 2 columns of thumbnails. This allows you to easily select all the even or odd pages, which can be useful if you need to crop them differently. (2) Open the ruler tab of the inspector to see details on what you are cropping.Thank you both for your feedback. There are indeed a couple of authorised service centres close enough that I may end up having to take it to.Thanks for your reply!  DTrace is of use from a sysadmin standpoint, not just as an instrumentation tool for application development ?the chip in the ez-link card is not present in the iphone, and thus cannot be scanned.DTrace can indeed be tremendeously useful for sysadmin purposes. It is a rather complex tool, however. And I find the lack of documentation for the OS X implementation frustrating. While the language itself is the same across operating systems, the set of available probes is quite different.That doesn't work when you have a 1-line text box, and the text is longer then the box (as I believe the OP is asking about). The issue is how do you quickly get to the beginning of a line that extends past the edge of the window.of course its possible.  Try the url box in mobile safari.  Touch and hold your finger until the magnifier appears and then move it all the way to the left.  The text insertion point will keep moving to the left even whilst you hold your finger steady on the very left hand side.So VLC will do it for all video, including video in a browser like youtube? I was looking for an independent prgram.For alternatives to Code you may want to check http://alternativeto.net/software/coda/?platform=mac - they are ordered by people preference.Works perfectly in one-line text boxes and in full pages. It's not super fast, but it is the only way that works in all iPad apps. A few apps provide cursor keys -- Nebulous Notes, for instance -- but otherwise it's the magnifying glass and dragging.I'm not sure about your specific problem, but on my linux machine I run this: http://dump.domindthegap.co.uk/backup/backup to do an incremental (time machine like) backup of the disk using hard links. You just pretty much rsync to different directories first and just always have the newest one being pointed to by a "current" symlink.@doncherry: I know but what if I don't know their email address and it's not visible on their profileI should point out that it copies data to the drive  - it's the move and copy command that appear to be the issue.Then it obviously won't work. I don't know of a way to get 100%.@Fake Name - Thanks guys!  This is what I was looking for.Thanks!  The color highlighting was what I was looking for, but I had no idea of the asterisk option - I'll add this to my toolkit.I think this is the only way to do it. I got a new phone (refurb), and set it up fresh, and this calendar wasn't there. But this is the only answer that really tries to answer the question. Basically its just deleting the calendars and resetting its state and pulling the ones I actually want back down from MobileMeI wonder if nicknames would do the trick...Check the star rating and the user reviews before you buy.I meant play, thanksChanging the preference in the Acrobat viewer app (either Reader or Acrobat) is probably better; I have a feeling that if you remove the plugin, then Acrobat will think that it's install is "damaged" and may pester you to "repair" it. This might not seem like an issue, but intentionally creating a false positive doesn't help you detect when the installation is damaged for some other reason.It is perfect!!@idober Quick Look does play the mp3 and offers basic controls: play/pause and a scrubber for changing position in the track. However it only works if you don't leave the Finder or click on anything else in Finder. Still, I wanted to clarify that for future people reading this question.An interesting observation: when doing a TimeMachine backup to a network drive TimeMachine will automatically mount, backup and then unmount the remote TimeMachine share on the network drive. I wonder if you could exploit that to achieve what you want?+1 - I didn't know about the `space` option. Man, that's an ugly camera icon.+1 surprisingly i found out that not many people knew about this nifty feature in Mac OS XTo make it easier, the spacebar doesn't have to be pressed right in the sequence like that: Cmd-Shift-4 [release] gives you the crosshairs, after which you can press and release the spacebar.The shadows are automatic if you press space and capture just a window.For example I was not able to find the support for rounded corners in Coda.Ok, downloading... Is it possible to export the project from iMovie HD to something that iMovie 08 will open?Voting to close. Any answer here would be pure supposition and would be obsolete once the Mac Pro is released.I've added the jailbreak tag since there's no native way to do it.@Rafael Unfortunately no. You can export the finished product, or, like you saw, import the raw clips and then remake the project in the new version.ok. i'd always thought there's a chance that the phone may go haywire if i put it through some electronic scannerWow, that sucks! How can they release a program that totally ignores saved files from older version of the program!?? That's just BS from Apple.@Rafael Like I said, it's a completely different program. I guess having a timeline that advances by frame is too complicated for us mere mortals to handle.Yeah, this is too subjective. Who knows? Apple has no schedule, kinda sadly I'd say :)Unfortunately, there's still no new version of CSSEdit with CSS3 support, but if rounded corners are the only problem, you can use one of dozens web generators, for example: [cssround.com](http://cssround.com/).Thanks a bunch mate.The script works fine like this, but what if I have a 100 folders?Another satisfied CCC user here.The version that ships with 10.6.x is 2.6.9. It's quite out of date. As I understand it, it doesn't handle resource forks correctly. I wonder if we'll see an update in 10.7.x?Just did a quick test playing a 44mb mp3 with Vox and QuickTime, both the lastest versions. Quickly scrubbing the mp3 back and forth used the most processor, just playing it was non-max usage. **Vox**: cpu 2.3%, cpu max 5.0%, memory 11.3mb. **QuickTime**: cpu 2.8%, cpu max 7.1%, memory 35.4mb. **Conclusion**: neither is a pig, but Vox is definitely lighter, especially in memory use.Are you adding songs manually or automatically? (i.e. what is the setting set to in iTunes?)I wonder why someone downvoted my answer. Quicktime is free (as in beer) and light. That's what i use anyway when I don't want to add mp3's to my iTunes library.+1: I think QuickTime Player is a reasonable suggestion here.Interesting. :) That did solve the problem. I turned `Certificate Revolcation List` to `Best attempt`, following some security best practices advice a few months ago. I can't remember where I read it from. Anyhow, having it turned off does make it work as it did before. Kudos and many thanks!wow just noticed how old this question is. oh well, hopefully this answer is still useful!I don't know, @Rafael, your answer is certainly completely valid, even if it's not what the OP ended up using.The "Watch Me Do" action in Automator doesn't record everything, unfortunately.Hmm.  New one for me.  Thanks!solution suggested only works for mobile me accounts....No, I'm able to use them with my google apps account and POP3 account I have from school (which is also registered on Gmail).@Cawas I've added it properly now. However there's still no contacts!@Loic Wolff I can see the Gmail Contacts group. but there is no contacts within the group!I tried manual and auto sync at first, still did not work. Then I did a restore, and synced songs, manually, and afterwards, automatically. I can see the songs in the iPod now. Restoring the iPod from iTunes did the trick.If you followed the steps on Peter's link, it's just a matter of waiting a moment so it can sync. If it has been, let's say, 1 hour and it haven't synced yet there are only 3 options: either you have no contacts to sync, there's no internet connection or the setup is not right. It's probably the later.I ENVY you getting those download speeds! Who is your bandwidth provider? Sorry, I have no idea about solving your problem. I would try another torrent downloader, uTorrent for example. That would confirm if the problem does indeed lie with Transmission, or not.Verizon FiOS, 35/35.I have been having the same problems since I added a second user account. I can now only backup my iPad 2 iPhone 4 via my newer user account. I have tried to modify ACL permissions and nothing has changed.I did that too, can't remember where either. But it had something to do with some Comodo certificate being corrupted or something.It's an obvious question, but, is Google Chrome your default browser?Yeh it is. Sorry I'll update my question.Does it happen with other app, too? Like Mail. I don't have a Mac right now, but could you try to open TextEdit, insert a link, wait for it to be detected (line return should do), click on it and see which browser is open?After some googling, I found Filevault might be a culprit, is it enabled?@Loic: I don't use Mail but TextEdit and Terminal open links in Google Chrome. I'm pretty sure all my apps do except Adium. I don't have FileVault enabled.Any Adium extension installed?@Loic: Just the SkypePlugin. Do you think that could be the cause?I don't use it and don't know what it does, but just in case, disabled/uninstall it, and then test if the links work correctly.Looking at the documentation, it doesn't seem SkypePlugin temper with the incoming messages. But it doesn't hurt to temporarily remove it.Some other basic questions: do you use themes to display your messages? Are you up to date?@Loic: It basically allows Adium to hook into Skype. I'll disable it and report back. Just gonna grab a bite to eat first. Thanks for your help with this. :)You're right. It was after that Comodo ordeal, when malicious certificates were issued to certain popular companies and later revoked.@Loic: Thank you dear sir. It appears there's some type of bug with the [SkypePlugin](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=5011) that causes this behaviour. It's a shame because it's a useful plugin for me. Oh well. I'll accept an answer from you if you care to write one up. Thanks again. :)Thanks very much Loic. After uninstalling the [SkypePlugin](http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=5011) everything is working as it should.If you're happy working in the Terminal [this](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1314/how-to-set-default-file-permissions-for-all-folders-files-in-a-directory) may be the answer you're looking for.Same old story, supposedly 1080p recording, but only with custom software... I'm beginning to see why Cisco charges 100K for their web conferencing solutions.Than you very much for your help!I'd try using activator and SBSettings.In that *earlier question* you pointed it says it fixes the brightness on lockscreen too - and I don't experience this problem on my 4.3.3 neither do I remember such issue on 4.2 and I do pay attention to the brightness... So, maybe there's something wrong at your side?@Cawas I'd not be surprised if there was *something wrong*, it wouldn't be the first time the phone acts up. I accepted the answer to that other because it did solve the brightness issue in general, but not in the lockscreen - that remains, hence this new question. I'd be willing to do some kind of total reset and blank reinstall, but this isn't Windows :-) so I'm not sure how to go about it.Both are installed. Are there any specific settings you can recommend?I didn't mean it's necessarily a bug on the device... For instance, there is an **auto-brightness** setting that I leave **on** *and* with that sometimes the brightness change to adapt with local lights. If you got that off, then it should never change. From your last question, I noticed a comment where you payed attention to this, but you haven't specified anything about it here. And, this is just an instance. Since you've being toying with it, maybe there's another setting elsewhere, including on jailbroken apps you may have gotten.Thanks! that was itI'll put that in the question too.You are correct about the Verizon iPad 1, but the Verizon iPad 2 has its own built-in CDMA 3G system.I think it is but the best answer will simply come from Apple: http://www.apple.com/support@nix fair point.

You'd use that to delete the partition and recreate a new one. Alternatively, ask your friend for the password.Very interesting, thanks! Unless I get told otherwise by Apple support, I'll recommend they keep all receipts,  write a contract to make the transfer legit, and then just go ahead and try to register the AppleCare in the new name.@Pekka: Enjoy your new Macbook!  BTW, getting (at least a copy of) the original receipts along with the transfer wouldn't be a bad idea as well.thanks, but sadly, it's not for me! :) I hope to be getting myself one next year though. Yeah, keeping all the receipts is definitely a good idea, I will pass that on.I will try keeping an eye for that Disk Utility access. thanks!SIM-free usually implies that it is not locked to a network provider, meaning that you can put a SIM card from any network in it. This is often lumped in with jailbreaking as it is sometimes necessary to jailbreak in order to unlock. But it's also possible to just go to the Apple Store and buy an unlocked iPhone in many countries.Thanks, really useful. You can also use `launchctl load -w ...` to make the change persistent. Based on your feedback I updated my [OSX poweruser configurator script](https://gist.github.com/993847)May I ask why you're using `slocate` instead of Spotlight?

I recall doing something similar on a vista machine where I installed ISC Bind so I could block certain DNS lookups.This only runs locate.updatedb weekly (every saturday morning at 3:15am).

You can find them in Utilities.@Lyken Looking at the system profiler, I have the latest firmware (compare to SMC version here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1381 ) and I do recall that software update performed this for me - it went through the whole reboot, grey screen with progress bar, etc process.  Is there another firmware I should be worried about?No there isn't that I know of. If everything is up to date, the next logical step is a visit to an apple authorised repairer.Also a really good idea to uncheck this everywhere as a new version "Mac Guard" now can run as a standard user, no need for admin password for installing.this should be a comment, not an answerWhen you hit spacebar, does a preview come up in quicklook?

All types seem to work when pressing the spacebar but none show a preview in the icon.I've had no problems with configuring a DMZ host and virtual servers are easy on the OS end (configure two IP for one interface if you don't have multiple physical ports) and use port mapping.What does your console show? Go to "Utilities" in your Dock, then "Console", and then "All Messages" or "Console Messages" in the left-hand tree. (If you don't see a tree, click "Show Log List" in the upper-left corner.) Look for error messages around the time your system reboots and see if anything rings a bell or post it here and see if anyone can answer it. Spontaneous reboots can be from any number of reasons ranging from a recent software install to faulty hardware or simply just overheating.Interesting, apparently BIND is built into OSX.

Reading the comments after the question was posed, it sure looks like this was a case of "some program code isn't perfect so the math gets done wrong"I realized it's not so obvious why I consider this video difficult. I have edited the question explaining that.Cool. Thanks for the link.The part of this answer that is not logical. Is why a Garmin GPS can run for days or weeks on a few AA batteries and an iphone can only last a few hours.1. GPS run on AA batteries? 2. GPS are optimized for, well, GPS tasks. They probably have better (more expansive) GPS chips that use battery. The iPhone has to run a lot of other things AND run the GPS. And the GPS chip is probably cheaper and consume more battery.From reading the take apart guides of the iPhone and consumer GPS units, the GPS processing circuitry are all about equivalent in power consumption. What these units have are optimized apps, CPU/GPU and screens where the iPhone has way more complex components that use more power.I didn't realize emacs was installed by default.

It does let you *turn them off*, if you want, but they are normally enabled. The major speed differences come down to different drivers for the virtual hardware used to interface with the VM.@Fake Hmm, someone whose low-level OS knowledge I trust explained to me at some length a couple of weeks ago how they were different. Let me do a bit of research and I'll come back and change my answer if I don't have something solid to point to. Thanks for bringing it up, and no need to start with "....Uh" and such: SO/SA is a fine place to correct someone with facts, I certainly don't mind being wrong now and then. Let's just keep it about supplying the best answers.All three virtualization systems listen leverage hardware virtualization extensions (AMD-V/VT-x if you have them), and none of the above use hypervisors.There are two definitions of hypervisor ( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor ). All three virtualization techniques listed above use type-2 hypervisors, and none have the option to run as a type-1.To be clear, there are certainly differences between type-1 and type-2 VMs, and that may have been what your friend was talking about. Alternatively, he might have meant Paravirtualization ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paravirtualization ), which I *think* Virtualbox supports, and all the others definitely have.Also, it's worth noting that VMWare benchmarks similarly to VirtualBox in all areas excepting graphics performance (Which Virtualbox does suck at a bit), so it is definitely not slower. http://www.techairlines.com/2009/09/07/virtualbox-3-0-4-vs-vmware-workstation-6-5-3/ http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020They could do without the ugly anchor animation.I'm satisfied. I re-read up on hypervisors and came to the same conclusion between the article you point to and another, and indeed, they all support hardware virtualization very similarly (Parallels supports extended page tables). I thought that VirtualBox wouldn't run the same Windows install as the one in Boot Camp's partition (if you were using both), but with enough hoop-jumping you can. I saw a lot of benchmarks and they seem to depend a lot on whoever last released a new version, except for graphics where VB isn't great and Parallels is currently in the lead.Thanks for pushing me to come up with a better answer! I've edited the answer.@CarlosZ Thank you! I knew there was a way to do it but I forgot. But I'm like @Cawas at this point: I rarely maximize anymore after switching from Windows (where it seems like everyone maximizes).Also note that DTerm is now in the Mac App Store.Thanks, I suspected the memory would be the main factor so it looks like I should aim for 4GB at least.Yeah, 4GB will work ok.

I'd bet he did it, though maybe it was directly with *even less resourceful* youtube recorder! :PThe answer above shows you the native way of doing what you need, yet the easier and smarter way would be to use a tool like Neuvasync. It all depends you what you are trying to achieve. For example. I want all my devices to be in sync without having to plug things in and manually sync them. I just want everything to work without having to worry. Neuvasync and simular tools allow this. There are free options.@Liviu Unless the 100 are in the same place, you'll have to do this to each of them. But, if each of the folders is in the same place (/Users/bob/Desktop/Folder1, /Users/bob/Desktop/Folder2, etc), we can automate it. Let me know whether or not all the folders are in the same place.oh yeah sorry about that, i had clicked it but then it told me to wait for a minuet so i went to do something else and must have forgot about it :p. my badWhat program are you using to write docsu actually might even be able to do this with itunes. It would technically "sync" but it would add or subtract any music, etc.LOL,  I checked the file, hoping that i may find some parameters inside the binary and I discovered that it was a symlink to `cupsfilter`. The question still stands, I want to see what options I can add when I convert HTML to PDF.That's weird. When I plug in my adapter it just works perfectly out of the box with my external monitor (it's only 1680x1050 thought). Also on a 13" MBP.@VxJasonxV Yes; mds shouldn't be able to nuke the entire system unless something really bad is going down. Which leads me to think that either the Apple NTFS driver is encountering something it doesn't like and panicking, or that the drive itself is failing in some way. To see if the driver is at fault, I suggest going to NTFS-3G (w/ the benefit of r/w on NTFS) and seeing if it does the same thing. If it doesn't, the driver is more adept at handling the error, but if it does, something else is going down, and it's likely the hard drive. Checking S.M.A.R.T. is never a bad thing, anyway.You could always use a script of some kind. I edited to include a python example.On the plus side, there's probably some web proxy software that lets you change the user agent on a site-by-site basis. If your Wi-Fi network has a computer on it that's always on, you could set it up there and then just put the proxy in your Wi-Fi settings on the i-device.I'm assuming the user agent would be detected on the server side.You might be able to do something like that with [Glimmerblocker](http://glimmerblocker.org/).enterprise apps can be installed directly from a the manufactors homepage, without going through appstore nor itunes.whoops, will add that inCan you post some hardware specs? When did you buy your mini?Try going to Console.app and see what logs are there which can help us diagnose your problem.i am having the same problem and it only happens some of the time. the keyboard shows that i hit the key by highlighting it or enlarging it but it dosent go into the text body and its very frustrating. i have tried restoring and everything to get rid of it but it dosent go away.on a jailbroken iPhone, you can download [User Agent Faker](http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=3207) and change the user agent to another browserIf this is true, they put a truly admirable amount of work into all this slicing!Interesting.  I did not even know about the Album Rating.  I see that on my "Favorites" playlist (4 & 5 star songs) the Album Ratings range from 3 to 5 already, but they're hollow stars.  I'll have to experiment with that a bit.I made a Smart Playlist and set the filter as "Album Rating is 5 stars" and so far that looks like an easy step in the right direction.  As a smart playlist, I did not have to do anything album-by-album.  It took my 74 5-star songs and turned it in to 394 - so now I'll have to check if all 74 songs (and their albums, tho some are from the same album) made it to the list.I think this can be done purely with Smart Playlists. I'll try after breakfast.xMarks works fine with Safari, if you don't mind system preference plugins.EDIT: It seems you can't. @Chuck has the right idea here I believe.I've never entered a password for Facetime on my phone, and I don't personally recall a verification SMS either. I'm fairly certain I've never entered a password into Facetime.app on my MacBook Pro, either.@VxJasonxV I distinctly remember flicking the switch to turn on Facetime when I got my iPhone 4 and receiving a verification text. The reason being I had SMS blocked and I had to get it unblocked to get the text and enable Facetime.@bmike What I'm curious about is what happens when you have two devices (say an iPhone 4 and iPad) using the same AppleID? Do they both ring when someone calls?@Keri, Thanks for the informative answer. I have not installed anything that I am aware of. What is mds? How do I check S.M.A.R.T?Is this a new problem or has it been that way since the day you bought it? Also, did you jailbreak your phone?@styfle: I'm pretty sure you can't call an iPhone via e-mail address.Actually, it appears this webapp may no longer work. Perhaps due to the Nitro(?) JS changes made in iOS 4.3. Crap :(. My idea for testing this stands, my suggested means of doing so, does not.ie samba is part of standard Snow Leopard not just the server.Thanks, now I just have to hope that someone will write a script that would use lipo :)lipo -remove ppc executableNote, too, that `lipo -info filenamehere` will list the architectures an app includes, in case you're uncertain.The menu item can also be controlled from a script in `~/Library/Services` and/or `/Library/Services`You probably know already, but just be aware that removing 'unneeded' architectures can cause software update issues due to checksum failures and other such problems, so make sure you have a good backup first. For the amount of disk space you're likely to save, I'm never convinced it's worth the risk.Anything that's working in Quicktime player (including the Perian codecs) should be working in iTunes too, as iTunes is just using Quicktime for playback. So not sure what's going on there.

For your iPod (or any other iOS device), you're always going to have to convert though, I'm afraid.Based on this it shouldn't be too hard to create a script that does the cutting for `/Applications/`. Also it should have a blacklist, I'm sure there will be applications that will fail to work if you play with them.Parallels and VirtualBox both offer this 'windowed' mode as well.Hah! I've always wondered what's going on with that button. Thanks for asking the question.Do you mean iTunes itself (on your Mac) doesn't play it, or merely that it has to be converted before you can send it to the iPod?  The first would be truly strange, the second is normal.  iTunes itself can do the conversion.  And, yes, there will be two versions of it (on the Mac) afterward.@Redbeard0x0A: `say -v cellos droid`I have 3 itunes accounts, and I have logged in as each one, checked for updates and still there are no updates available but the badge still shows 7.I have checked all my apps and every app is either one of my 3 itunes accounts.  Thanks anyway for your help.@Rene right thanks, I've updated my answerThis application is no longer developed. The original app, `Smultron`, which was abandonned, is now developed again (and available on the App Store). So Fraise developer said there would be no other update to Fraise.I also discovered another tool that could be more powerfull `textutil`.Depending on your extensions it might just take a while. 10 seconds is a bit much, but I've seen long startup times as-well.Thanks for your answer, but: ~/Library/Contextual Menu Items - I don't have this folder; /Library/Contextual Menu Items - this folder is empty; ~/Library/Services - I don't have this folder; /Library/Services - I don't have this folder; /System/Library/Services - there's nothing in here that seems relevant. Any ideas?However by default .pkg files open with Installer so you have changed something on your machine.If you haven't specifically set an album's rating, iTunes averages the ratings for the songs you've rated on the album to determine the album rating. So if half the tracks are three stars and half are five stars, iTunes will rate the album at 4 stars. When an album has such a rating, the stars will be hollow, and filled in when you override this default rating.+1 I would prefer to stay with the default one if possible but if I get no answer for it in few days I will accept your answers. Thanks!@Mark you're right. Should have mentioned that. Thank you.Confirmed, hardware failure.The amount of disk space you can save is huge, this is why I am interested in this solution.On my system, where I have almost 200 applications in /Applications, Monolingual removed about 10 GB of data. On my wife's system, where there are far fewer applications, it removed 3 GB of data. I removed languages and architectures.I dislike them too but I've learned to cohabitate with them peacefully.Why do permissions in OS X get broken so frequently? I've always wanted to know.@boehj Sounds like a good question for a little site I know of ;).@Nathan: Hah! Very good point. I'll have some breakfast and post it up. :)Looks like we already have [one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13732/what-causes-permissions-to-change). The answers didn't get much love though.Got it.  I was just noticing that I have one 15 track album with 2x 5-star and 1x 3-star, but the overall album rating is 4 stars; that meshes well with the averaging idea.  Now I have to decide if I want to override that, or keep looking for another way to flesh out the "albums with 5 star songs" play list.@Matthew this is new problem. And I didn't jailbreak it.InsomniaX does not work on my 2011 Macbook Pro. Is there something I am missing? (When I close the lid, it just goes into sleep mode)Unfortunately the "Display pdf in browser using..."  was not uncheckable (grayed out).
Adobe Reader is an incredible trashy application on the mac!Thanks Chris!  Out of curiosity - why are some of the variables associated with launchd ?  The other ones make sense to me.Thanks Tigran!  That was interesting - I had searched for .profile, but I see that it is profile, as you have noted.@Mark - A good point.  In this case, the links are safe.Thanks Harald!  I saw a book recently, just on DTrace that covered it on other UNIX's and Mac OS.  I may pick it up - it included coverage of the D language.I'd be interested in knowing more about what bug and what non-Apple mouse you have where this occurs. Turns out that I've been using OS X since the early betas 95% of the time using non-Apple mice (different ones) and never ever had to delete that plist and/or restart or reset my buttons. And trust me when I tell you that I've used a lot of different mice. My only time with an Apple mouse was when I got a Magic Mouse with this Mac Pro, which I used for probably a couple of weeks before I threw it in the trash (not literally, my brother was happy about it).I took the liberty to reformat your answerAfter you do the desired changes to .plist open the Terminal and run killall Finder. With that you can avoid restarting your ?. As @Martin said, I have also been using MS mice for a while and never had such a problem with my ?.Thanks, I'll give it a go.That seemed to work, thanks! I have contacted the developers about this.Skype requires internet, so it's not acceptable.I understand your discomfort in this but from the other hand if the image crop boundary stays at the edge of your pasted image then you might not notice it there, especially on white background.This app http://appshopper.com/utilities/walkie-talkie-2 looks good. Please someone post this as answer so that I can accept it.I believe this is programmed into the Application and there's no way to alter its behavior. @Tigran raised a valid point. Perhaps a shortcut/gesture to make quickly expand it to all the image would be nice, but I couldn't find such thing.Hi cabbey. Thank you for the help. On the first step, I get exactly similar results (around 300 entries) with the working account and the broken one, so the diff gives nothing. Any other way to get the device name?Couldn't figure the device name from the first step. But I tried `ls -el /dev/* > /tmp/_all_working_account` on the fresh new account and `ls -el /dev/* > /tmp/_all_broken_account` on my account. The only significative difference in the diff is:
crw--w----  1 test2  tty        16,   0 May 30 12:15 /dev/ttys000
for the file _all_working_account and 
crw--w----  1 lv    tty        16,   0 30 mai 12:17 /dev/ttys000

crw--w----  1 lv    tty        16,   1 30 mai 12:18 /dev/ttys001
for the file _all_broken_account.When the comment was written - the text just read link not the URI as it is nowWell, after @Marks comment I have edited the links to make it more transparent.This handles the menu bar at the top of the screen. I'm curious why you think that will fix the mouse.Looks nice. Will try it this evening.remote bash profile is OK. I want change the Terminal.app profile (from 'Basic' for example to 'Homebrew') **before** run my ssh command. And remote .bash_* *does not* set my local terminal settings. (Or, if yes, can you provide an example - how?)Hi @jm666, see whether the commandlinefu.com(http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/5049/osx-script-to-change-terminal-profiles-based-on-machine-name-use-with-case-statement-parameter-matching) could help you with that.Man - COOL - This is what i exactly want. Thanks. :) Can you pls add the link into the body of your answer?+1 thanks, Solarize is nice and I will use it, but the question was not about how to "tune" the colors, it was about adding colors to the output of different commands.I think they could make the marching ants prominent enough that you would notice it. Just seems like a poor designDone it, thanx! I have no way to confirm diskutil is running, but a `@hourly touch ~/crontest` is, so I'll asume it works.oh no i dont need to zoom in, its not like the message is too small. It just disappears extremely fast but it doesnt exit out of it. So my mac is still expecting me to click cancel or close all browsers (i.e its not letting me click anything else) but i cannot because the error message is no longer on the screenBut now that I see, the `@hourly touch ~/crontest` works only when the OS is running at the exact **:00 hour, so will @monthly skip if the OS is not running at an exact time? like 1st day of month at 00:00 ?+1 For proper terminal colour definitions. In general colours are personal but I would recommend to enable features more on a system-based way than by adding a plugin.The way that Spotlight finds the files is based on the frequency that you are using that file. So if in the first instance you can't find your file then you can try first press "Show All" results where your file might show-up.Well, this is always a matter of prospective. On the other hand if you are just interested to crop a little bit from the edges why not do it in Apple Preview, save it and then paste it into the Keynote. In Preview you can adjust the crop window as you wish from the beginning. Just a thought ...Follow the advice here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1072/spotlight-indexing-appears-stuck-what-can-i-do/1082#1082Yeah I'm the same @styfle but it is still useful sometimesSorry to hear it. Thanks for the feedback.@Tigran (what an awesome name! I want to be called Tigran) I'm not using Spotlight from the menu bar, I'm using it from the search box on a finder window, so there's no `Show All`, actually I think it's already showing all. Isn't it a little clumsy that Spotlight only finds the most used files, which you probably would find yourself anyway?It's 75.3% useful@Petruza no, but then you'll have to post more information about the way you're searching, the type of file and the exact spotlight command you're entering. Each answer has a "link" text below, click on it and copy it to the clipboard ;)mds is Spotlight's daemon (background service). The app I like to recommend for checking SMART status is [SMART Reporter](http://www.corecode.at/smartreporter/).Can a .command script get a dropped file as argument in a $1 variable, for example?I *think* I've understood and correctly translated what you meant. If not, make the necessary modifications.+1 - Does what it says on the tin. Cheers. A question: Where would I put such a config file at a more general level (i.e. not in ~)?@dean And we need more information, what type of account is this? Gmail? I've noticed that when I have Gmail on push on my phone, the changes are not applied if I open a new mail on the MacBook directly after receiving it. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a fix for that.IMHO the your $HOME/.profile is the best place, but if you want can put them into system wide `/etc/profile`. e.g. sudo open /etc/profileGood idea! Would be nice though if apple just made it work in one application. Thanks!Sounds like less of a problem with your mail clients and more of a problem with the IMAP server configuration.@Graham Theres not much to configure with the imap the username,password and server. It tells me that its using IMAP in the settings.@dean can you post some screenshot? of both the iPhone and you Mac setup.I'm not able to pair my white plastic topped Mini (Core Duo) with a headset to accomplish microphone input.Bummer - you might have to wait for someone to answer how to troubleshoot problems with the Apple ID or the iTunes app. Have you tried asking Apple online for support? Anything that makes me less likely to spend money on the store always gets their attention to help me resolve/understand the issue whether I'm in warranty or not.@dean Thanks. First of all, you don't have push notification. See on the last picture? If you had push, there would have been a "Push" entry to select. Since you don't have it, it's just fetching every 15 minutes.How would it be a server error if it works by reading it on the iPhone and it shows read on the mac? Plus the idea of IMAP is that it connects with the server to view the email.I will try with thunderbird i HATE anything to do with the app store.I am curious what your upstream link speed is on each ISP. It seems link aggregation might not be as useful on the mac as it would be on the router.With thunderbird its worked as it should. Saying that there is a fault with the mac set up.Right this is weird i've changed nothing all is back as it was before and is now working correctly. This is strange :S.Yeah we haven't updated the site since tiger was around :L as I mainly lost interest in coding for OS X as I started using Linux more :D.Thanks.possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6846/install-iphone-app-without-itunes-interaction/7572#7572check the duplicate candidate. there are a number of ways to install apps and including @neoneye's suggestion you're still missing at least 2.Cause its the same thing you have to kill to get keyboard shortcuts working, all kinda the same?Thanks for the greetings! Those `kbd` tags are neat. But I was right about the sleeping, try it :) I've added some other combinations for further clarification.I think my brain transposed Command for Control. Sorry about that. I also forgot that other combinations of Alt, Control, and Command have other functions. Also, my statement of "A+C+E" was ambiguous since C can mean Control or Command. We're both right, I guess :).As longs as it's MP3 (and not AAC) you can use free ID3 tag editing software like [Musorg](http://peippo.eu/musorg/Musorg-0.3.dmg.zip) to inspect the ID3 tag on the file and confirm for yourself that your email is or is not part of the metadata iTunes added to the file. Unfortunately I don't know if it's true or not (and I rip to AAC so have only iTunes for metadata editing and who knows what it hides from me, un-edit-able).I can't confirm if this works, but something you might consider is converting from HTML to LaTeX. Then convert from LaTeX to PDF since LaTeX is a common way to create hyperlinks in a PDF.keyboard shortcuts are more menu-centric than mouse movement, but I suppose this is still worth a shot.A fantastically good reason as to why one should only install software they trust, as well as only use trusted JB sources. As far as that goes, that isn't to say that all non-JB apps aren't good citizens either -- it's just harder to do, and they can't affect the entire system.A JB app can do pretty much whatever it wants. Consider iFile -- a fantastic JB file manager. It can see _every_ file on the system, change rights, delete files, edit them, etc. Now imagine installing a JB app that you think does one thing, but secretly does another. Guess what -- you're screwed. Only install trusted JB apps from trusted JB sources.What's in the console app for those applications? There might be something there that could point to the trouble.Agree w/ above. Do you have the same extensions on your Windows machine? If so, that might not be the cause, but the more extensions I add to FF, the slower it has _always_ become for me. (Which is why I use another browser for daily work.)Have you gone to a webpage that uses embedded fonts? Like [lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com)?Can you make a few fake events, export them from Outlook into vCal format, and then post it here? Might be helpful.Have you tried uninstalling chrome with something like appcleaner (http://www.freemacsoft.net/AppCleaner/) to completely remove chrome?But really, everything is on their website which took me 5 seconds to find with a Google search...If the program can open it, then it will add itself to that menu. Otherwise, it means it can't open it.This is correct +1 I added an image to make it clear :) Make sure that the search box (top right) is **empty** or you will get strange results, because that is also taken into consideration.@Erik I'd be interested in knowing if you've correctly removed all caches. You mention doing things in $HOME/Library (Application Support, Caches etc), but why don't you just use an utility like Onyx (http://www.titanium.free.fr/) just to make sure?Hmm, seems like a near-exact duplicate. I will add in the other options when I manage to get my MacBook back (can't type that well on the iPhone)I don't think the hardware actually supports it.I believe that launch services will notice your new drive, check the internal list of partitions stored in launch services' database, and finally mark as available all applications registered as belonging to a newly-available partition. In any case, whatever is done is ran upon making new partitions available. In any case, App Store most certainly uses the API -[NSWorkspace absolutePathForAppBundleWithIdentifier:].I don't know how do I find out?This laptop stand is really poorly designed and overpriced. I'd recommend getting a height adjustable Adam Hall stand for about half the price: http://www.adamhall.com/en/ah_Stands_SLT001E_-_Laptop_Stand.htmlDisk utility is not designed to fix NTFS volumes.Jordan: added vCalSeems to work fine. Must be that i pressed too many times and it was turning itself off and on right away.I've bought Cinder and iScreenshot both but don't know how to get full page screenshotNever mind. I got the answer now.Does not provide all the features for browsing (e.g. I couldn't find how to see New & Noteworthy apps), but still quite useful. I suspect Apple built it primarily for SEO.Please post as an answer so that we can see that this question has been answered. Thanks.Do other discs work in that drive?

Is there a non-$200 option?Thanks. Seems kind of ridiculous that I'd have to resort to a script, but I'll give it a shot.This doesn't work for me because I don't want to change the default application which opens the file.  I just want an additional choice.I've looked, and don't see anything notable.  When I force quit Aperture, it just says the process was killed.Thanks for your answer. This certainly gets me well on my way to finding my solution.Ooooohhhhhhhhh!!! `Other...` menu option opens the door to whole new search capabilities! +1 I'm growing to love SpotlightThe picture on Belkin's site, as compared to this picture, makes it look like the stand is flexibly tense? Meaning you can bend it to a certain extent and it will keep enough tension to act as a mount?I'm aware that in theory one option is to go into the .plist for a given application and start creating additional file types (see http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?CFBundleTypeRole). However, I'd rather not have to do that, and it seems like there's a lot of potential for error.Well okay, I suppose it depends on your definition of 'huge', but I still consider the adage 'disk space is cheap' to be be worth bearing in mind here. If you're sweating over 10GB or less, it's probably time to think about upgrading your hard drive anyway-- OS X performance will be starting to degrade with so little free space, and it's probably taken you a year or two to fill it up that much, so you'll probably be somewhat nearer the end of the drive's mechanical life than its beginning.Ben since posting my answer I've purchased the HDMI adapter myself and can confirm that on iPhone 4 any app that doesn't support mirroring can be enabled by jailbreaking and installing DisplayOut.How do you know that?I actually have an interesting example. Take a look at the bottom left hand side of http://www.apple.com/ipod/, and see also http://www.apple.com/ipod/red/. It's their only product name that is pure caps.for whatever reason this one did not, but it was the first time plugging it into a monitor of that resolutionI have a 500GB disk and yes it's not so big, if you use it with two versions of xcode, two os version, a windows with visual studio inside, and some music....@Ian I'm sure there is, but I haven't seen it yet.After looking for two days, I've yet to find one, for Mac or Windows, that retains hyperlinks that have anchor text. Very strange.I like to add -c (du -shc *) to get a nice total at the end too.Nothing wrong on any of those screenshots, Pacerier. And I meant what Peter said: can't know for sure what's going on but it's highly likely that's something wrong on your end. Can you see your contacts on http://contacts.google.com ? Also you didn't show us the config screen shot that matters the most: http://www.cl.ly/1S0d151O1l340T0U2w3V this is how yours should look like. If you're getting e-mails through it, it's indeed weird that contacts and calendar isn't being properly synced.But you said "Of course this should work with wifi", which I interpreted to mean that you have wifi available in the situation where you want to communicate.  If that's not the case, then please clarify your question.I'm assuming the answer is yes, but I'll ask anyway: are aperture and iTunes both up-to-date? Is the OS also up-to-date? Another option might be to simply reinstall Aperture and iTunes to see if that would work, that way you might avoid the reinstall of the entire OS. For spotlight, I suggest telling it not to index the movie directory to see if it helps. Annoying if it does, since searching won't work there, but I've had to do the same thing to my Virtual Machine folders since big files w/ lots of changes seems to nuke Spotlight.Thanks for that suggestion - a neat bit of lateral thinking - I'm not sure that it helps for my particular problem but I can see that it could be a useful trick in other cases.@Petruza left to right: icon view, list view, column view, cover flow, quick look, Action, Dropbox, ShellHere>, delete and burn.damn, page 33! did you read the other 32 pages?!@VxJasonxV Yeah, but it's not really long enough to do interesting things with, but it does allow you to be more *flexible* in the positioning of your device.My biggest problem with using this is that my Cigarette Lighter is recessed under my stereo deck and all the dashboard buttons. So I think, if the neck is long enough, the phone will be low, but may still work out. I'll have to check this out soon.@VxJasonxV Can you post a picture of its position?I simply put things in ~/Applications. Is there a specific reason you have the ~/local interjection?@Cawas - It's 224 pages in total; while I haven't read *all* of them, I do refer to the *Guide* enough that I keep a local copy around for quick searching.@VxJason - that's because Apple didn't name it; they're just licensees. Wikipedia has a good article about the [(PRODUCT)RED brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Red) if you want to know more.Heh. Only on a Mac site would people be concerned with stuff like this... how awesome. :)Yes, everything is up to date.Does the screen power off entirely? (Does a power light on your monitor turn off.) Or does the OS X interface go away, and the monitor displays some sort of "check input" message?

Could you be clearer on exactly which screen(s) turn off?sorry for being vague, when it happens there is no error, simply just switches off both on the external (non-apple) monitor and the laptop also screns also turns off. At this point on the external monitor I do get the "no signal" message and the laptop "seems" to be unresponsive.Thanks Neil. 1. Yep all fine on others, 2. Not apple Dell, how can I check the drivers? I have checked for updates and there are none so far, 3. no changes that I know of, 4. no errors, just switches off both the monitor and my laptop, after which the laptop seems to be 100% unresponsive, 5. Its got a fan, its been a great monitor, but since the laptop also turns off I don't think its an issue with the monitor, 6. It hasn't happened so far on the windows bootcamp. Where can I check for logs etc.?Not in a comment I can't. This link will have to do: [Honda Civic Interior](http://i.imgur.com/GN99v.jpg) Note how it's recessed behind the gear/handbrake. (And if anyone's interested, no, this is not actually a picture of my actual car, nor is this my picture.)Welcome to Ask Different. I'm not sure I understand what the question is here. Are you asking how to get the password off your iPhone? Please clarify by using the `edit` link above, and make sure your post is in the form of a question. Thanks!So, hold on... the monitor as well as *the entire laptop* switch off? Sorry, thought this was just the display. My untrained hunch is that this sounds like a power supply or a fan problem. You might be better off with the Apple forums; these boards aren't designed for back-and-forth troubleshooting. However, if you have a 13" macbook pro, it's possible you may need a [firmware update](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1599). (That one's not for the Pro line, but look around on Apple.com.)So the external screen isn't shutting down, but the macbook pro itself is.hi thanks a lot!, that was it, now my ipad,iphone are ready for Spanish too!!!, I have upvoted your answer, I asked, but because it was moved I cannot accept it, so tnx again! gracias!Also, Apple Support is really quite good. Are you still under warranty or under Applecare? Call them or make an appointment at the Apple Store to have it checked out. You'll lose more downtime by *not* having the problem fixed.Brilliant - so useful. Thankyou.Thanks for the suggestion, and I do use Alfred, but this in no way addresses the question of grouping applications in the dock...*nix heritage..+1 because if you press cmd+tab and release fast it doesn't show the app-switcher@Cawas how did you get to the screen at http://www.cl.ly/1S0d151O1l340T0U2w3V? I did get to that screen but only when i was doing the sync. after that i couldn't access that screen anymore. Btw in the description I put "Google" is it because of that that its causing me the problem?Btw its really weird i could add contacts from my phone's Google group (and it appears in contacts.google.com) but i can't read the existing contacts in contacts.google.com to my iphone..wifi does not impy internet. It may be ad-hoc networking, lan/wan bridging and so on.Excellent, thanks! I was able to convert the file system to case-insensitive one with that tool. Had to make a bootable DVD (need to have the original MacOS installation DVD for that)Yes music CDs and software disks are fine.+1 Agreed. You can definitely do it, but you run a huge risk of it not actually running on the device. The single biggest issue is that the simulator doesn't have the memory limitations of the device, so it's very easy to write something that will crash the first time it's on a device, without knowing it.It could also help to mention the type of app that you're looking, in case anyone can give you a hint there.There are tons of apps you can develop that don't use gestures, the camera, or tilt/shake, so that't not necessarily a limitation. As a result I don't agree with "Clearly: No." I still wouldn't recommend it, if for no other reason that even if you're not using any of that stuff, there's plenty of code that will run on the simulator but will crash a device.Jailbreaking an iPhone is not illegal and you don't lose your warranty as far as I know.I recommend you take a look at 1Password so you don't have to forget it and change it ever again.for next time: http://www.lastpass.com - which I prefer over http://www.1password.com - lol hey @Martin! marginalized minds do think alike, huh? :PDid you ever get this resolved?True, but the same is true of virtually every other answer here.I can say samething here, Chuck, I try syncing my google with iPhone since the beginning... but I disagree on the NuevaSync. Back few years ago when I tried it it wasn't anything better than Google's Exchange at all - specially not easier. You don't seem to have tried it, because you cited an advantage which doesn't comply with reality - native Exchange is synced automatically in real time over any connection to the net.Pacerier, from your [3rd screen](http://i.imgur.com/PoRkA.gif) just tap on the "Account [blank]@gmail.com". It should be quite obvious, since it has a little right arrow as any other menu list with more options inside. You mean if you go to the HTTP on Safari from your iPhone, the contacts aren't there? So you're probably using 2 different accounts! :o@Pacerier what do you mean by "enable google sync"? I think it's [pretty evident you need that enabled](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-sync-now-with-push-gmail-support.html), though I don't know how to even have it disabled.Just wondering, can you see those details due to some gmail lab addon on the desktop?Same thing happened to me when I downloaded Xcode 4. After 2GB+ it stopped downloading. I had to do it allover. The second try did work though. I think it has something to do with the Apple server.+1 for the cart. Looks nice and ... pricey.DragThing did it. When I click on an app that app comes to foreground and becomes active.cool trick. A few times in my screencast I need to switch between browser, IDE and terminal and in that case this trick did not work. I am going with DragThing.I tried this and I found it to be distracting. Also the visual look between browser and IDE is different enough that no one gets confused. This is screencast so people know what's coming next like I am going to browser. Thanks.Fantastic! This solved the whole problem for me! Great. Many thanks!I didn't use Onyx, but as @jm666's answer basically seem to be the same (clean the font cache) this probably works as well. Thanks for the tip!Yes, I didn't know about atsutil et al, so when I said I'd removed all caches, I meant I physically removed caches, everything related to chrome etc etc, in $HOME/Library. But atsutil solved the whole issue so I'm now a happy camper.OK, but now that they are all on the school iTunes account, will a student who has one of these things be able to BUY things from iTunes charging it to the school account?System imaging tools are built into Windows 7, so external tools are not required.Unless you give them the password, no. You should also use the built-in **Restrictions** to further lock it down and disable access, if that's what you want of course.Indeed! But the end result is just amazing you must agree :DThanks for this. Its bad that I'm still looking at a fair amount of time to repartition and install Windows, but I think I'll gain the time spent once I've got my windows install off that criminally slow drive ;-)No, I don't have any add-ons on the desktop - I just see the full details when using a computer as opposed to the iPhone. On the iPhone, I only see who it's from and to, but not the time or location nor have the ability to accept the meetingDo the Cydia developers screen the main repositories for malware?WOW, that's new for me. Thanx for the info - going to check.Good point, I didn't review the other answers but still three of them were on-topic... Anyway sorry if I came off really 'nazi' and thanks for pointing out Alfred (which, your answer actually also applies to Spotlight or any app launcher - but Alfred is great)Thanks Nathan, I hope my question is clearer now"After an update..." what kind of update? If it was an iTunes/OS X update, did you try reinstalling the two components afterwards?I suppose it is ultimately a matter of choice, but since Apple gives you guidance on this sort of thing as noted above, it would seem strange not to follow it.@Phil What connector/adapter/cable are you using to connect your MacBook Pro to the monitor? What kind of monitor is it? How old is your MacBook Pro?Yes, I have several times without any success. Is there any sort of log that I can check to see if iTunes is loading the components?I have the same problem with an Acer LCD display connected via HDMI over Mini-DP to a circa 2010 MBPro 15".@Cawas ok here's the 4th screen: http://i.imgur.com/5LNUy.gif@Cawas i mean there's no contacts here: http://i.imgur.com/MtYOj.png http://imgur.com/axxXZ.png . In the second screen shot, i've added a contact called "Test" and when i visit contacts.google.com in my laptop's browser the "Test" contact appeared. i don't access the safari in my iphone, but when i access contacts.google.com using my browser in my laptop the contacts are there.@styfle - If you could get the iPhone to take an apple ID instead of the phone number - it would ring like all the other devices. I don't know of a way to merge the two - when the person calls they have to choose to call a number or an ID - (currently) they are not actually calling multiple accounts belonging to one person - just one "account" is called.@Cawas im not sure if the google sync we are talking about is the same thing. i read it from here: http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=135937 `To enable Google Sync for your users:

1) Sign in to your Google Apps administrator control panel.

2) From the menu bar at the top of the page, select Settings.

3) Select Mobile in the left menu.

4) Select the radio button next to Enable Google Sync.

5) Click Save changes.`Good points on the logfile database. I don't know if any of my mac have ever logged an email address (I just checked several) but mobile me acccount names and other things are certainly logged by default. Whatever method of wiping you prefer before a reinstall can also be done as `srm` and erase free space in Disk Utility. I guess it's a personal call - is it faster for you to clean around the apps you wish to leave, or wipe once and reinstall / update those apps. I can see how one is faster for some but no universal best option.Perhaps this would be better commenting that most software is licensed for one user and not deleting the software from a machine you no longer posses and keeping the software might have legal consequences. Unless you or the questioner have actual legal advice appropriate for the location of the poster - the safe bet is to erase the mac and only leave software installed that you are selling with the machine.Do consider two things. If you are selling a machine to someone without the media to reinstall and properly own that app - what happens if they have a crash or make a mistake? Do the right thing by making really sure the buyer understands exactly what they are getting. Also think about doing the right thing by the people that made the software you are selling. Any software you bought almost certainly has a license calling out what you are supposed to do in this case. Check with a lawyer if you're not sure what you own and what you only have a license to use.If there were one, I'd imagine the place to look woud be in `Console` under the 'FILES' Heading, `~/Library/Logs` sub-heading. There may *be* something in there under XiphQT.Hi - I can't answer the question but after a recent update My Mac started doing the same thing. I have Open Office, Chrome, Firefox and XCode on the machine. I upgraded Xcode in the last 3 weeks and I did a full update last week. Being an old PC guy I am used to computers breaking, just not my Powerbook.Yes you can view them from the Photos app. I was hoping that SDK access to the Kit would be possible and somebody came up with a movie player. That would be a nice open source project, so devs could compile the sources as an adhoc app (no jailbreaking required).4th screen looks quite all right too. You are very confusing, Pacerier... But if that last test you've done is as flawless as it seems, I'd say you have to do the [suggested contacts backup (on 2nd requirement step)](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&topic=14252) for a 1st sync - maybe Google Sync can't do that after all. I can't recall in my case if my first time it was synced due to cable sync or over the air, but they do keep in sync over the air.@Pacerier so you're using google apps after all? up there you seem to say you're not. In any case, it should be just a matter of "enabling google sync" then, as you just described.Here's another idea: is your **push** enabled?Well, that being the case, I suppose you can put movies on the SD Card, import them, and play them in Photos.app.../var/log/maillog - logging email recepients but only when using internal smtp. (not a common case - but anyway) :)Nope. I've been using IE since the problem started, and today is actually my last day at that job so it will be uninstalled. I guess we will never know what the issue was :(Shazam! didn't even think of setting up smtp. It goes to show how complicated logging can be - especially with the new log databases and not the old flat files of yore.This seems to not always be true.  TextEdit can open URLs, but it is not in the "Open With" submenu.This does not seem to work.  In "Get Info", I can "Open With" the same applications as normal, or choose "Other".  If I choose "Other", I can choose from all applications, and either check or uncheck "Always Open With".  Even after opening the file once with TextEditor, it does not appear as an additional option in the "Open With" submenu.Not exactly what you asked for, but this free prefpane lets you manipulate the file type associations. http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/Perfect. Thank you very much.Glad you worked this one out. It was a real head scratcher.@Phil does OS X let you change the refresh rate for the display (System Preferences-> Displays)? If so, what's it set at?Try resetting your network settingsShoot, you're right. I will edit the answer to reflect this and update it with an alternate suggestion.As I'm pretty sure we have exactly the same problem, I'll post a link back to my thread on DIY here too in case someone either has an answer, or in case an answer is found and someone coming here needs it: http://audio.stackexchange.com/questions/1494/cooled-soundproof-enclosure-for-a-noisy-laptop-in-a-bedroom-studio@bmike I never had to mess with SMS either. And yes,  iPhones right now can only respond to ones made to your phone number, while computers, iPads, and iPod Touches all link to your Apple ID account.@bmike considering the licensing and recovery points you make here, it is clear that trying to "bundle" the installed software is wrong.  With this in mind, I'll accept @petruza's answer since it provides the clearest approach to erasing data :-)FWIW turning my Acer monitor off and then back on again fixes. No need to sleep the Mac.Thanks for your response, this is the kind of information I was originally seeking, but I've been convinced that wiping the machine is the best choice since "bundling" my installed applications was a bad idea for several reasons...I have the same problem -- I'm using an Acer monitor that has a handful of inputs (HDMI, VGA, DVI) allowing it to basically act like a TV if one were so inclined. What seems to happen is after my MBP goes to sleep the monitor starts searching for a signal (before it turns itself off) and ends up on HDMI with no signal (hence the snow). I don't have the problem with seeing my desktop faintly, but I've seen this on other multiple input displays, including my TV -- I believe that this can be chalked up to ['cross talk'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk).Taking the answer back. It only works if I reboot while the adapter is plugged in.Noted Chuck, thanks !I have the same problem with my Acer LCD display connected over via DVI converted from DisplayPort to an iMac. Every once in a while the Acer comes on with snow. Forcing it to re-detect its inputs always has worked for me with no change to the iMac necessary. My only thought is that for some reason the monitor might be missing the signal on the DVI/HDMI port at first and landing on another port with no signal (hence why scanning inputs work). But not really sure, just that when it happens, it's just a little annoying.i were downloading it with the developers license.ok....will try again@Cawas Huh.. i'm not in any organization / school / etc.. and i don't know if im using google apps. but i do have a google apps accountOne other method: If gifted to you, do they contain your info (probably), or the giftee, or both?@Cawas yep i guess so: 1) http://i.imgur.com/mxj4G.png 2) http://i.imgur.com/S4cYV.png 3) http://i.imgur.com/VAvgy.png 4) http://i.imgur.com/RHmYM.png 5) http://i.imgur.com/ooofx.png 6) http://i.imgur.com/LpRg0.png+1 for yet another such obvious feature that simply doesn't exist.@Pacerier Google Apps could well be called "Google Enterprise". That's what it is for. If you don't know if you're using it, you probably are not. But if you mention you have an account there for sure, then there's someone responsible by the domain (which is not gmail or any google's) usually called the administrator, who must be able to enable / disable Google Sync for the domain. The shortest advice I can give you is: **read, dude**.@Cawas: I'm not sure ... he also posted this screenshot (http://i.imgur.com/PoRkA.gif), with @gmail.com domain, but it's possible that he is using two different accounts."Not sure" of what, @Peter? As for using two different accounts, I've suggested that already but I hope he did read it and kindly ignored because he'd be using just a single account and he does seem to pay attention at this post at least. But it's well worth it re-enforce this: Pacerier if you have a gmail and a apps account, they are not the same! :oYeah, it is enabled. If I were in such a case I'd try a different account from someone I could borrow and that works with an iPhone, and try my account on his iPhone, to pinpoint if the issue is on the phone or on the account. Because unlike I pointed about 17 hours ago above, that Google Sync might simply not push everything up after all, I just did this test on my side: I disabled contacts from my exchange account and they all (1252 of 'em) got deleted. Then I simply re-enabled them and slowly they're still sync'ing back. Up to 250 now. I just leave it on Contacts and I can see it happening.done 1252 back, over the air. no issues.Thanks, this is useful but does not solve the problem. The full format used is still not ISO-8601.OK - you can install gnu coreutils which includes gnu ls, which will do what you want. Easiest way is one of brew, MacPorts or Fink. I use brew - so just running 'brew install coreutils' works. You'll then have gls available.A non-answer, but still possibly useful: The stat(1) command is quite flexible and can be made to display time stamps in any desired format.Hmmm... I thought I remembered there being an answer that someone posted. Was it deleted? Didn't know that could happen.@Cawas: sorry for not being clear. I was just thinking that if his email on the screenshot ends with @gmail.com then he is probably not using google apps account. (I bow to your effort here)Peter, yeah... I know that, but I didn't account it in. Well noted!My apologies, you're right. I assumed that using wifi in this capacity on iPhones would be impossible. In order to connect two or more iPhones _without_ an intermediate base station (or a computer acting as one), I _thought_ it would require one iPhone to act as a base station, or use sort of ad-hoc networking. I was under the impression that iOS didn't provide this capability, but apparently,  newer iOS versions **do** via something called [Game Kit](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/GameKit_Guide/GameKitConcepts/GameKitConcepts.html). Thanks!I suspect that it contains your information. 'Your' being the downloader, the giftee. Because it's licensed to you. It's entitled to you.

I don't know this 100% for sure, however.:-) @petruza's answer is very good - glad you have lots to choose from. You can always sell the original OS CD and bundled software with the mac. Just don't keep a copy for yourself and you're fine.+1 for USB monitors. I love coding with three equally large monitors (or 4 when doing serious code merging all week long) but a mac pro with multiple graphics cards is a lot more expensive than a MacBook Pro.The new unibody mac feet are seriously embedded into the thin aluminum. If they are worn a small plastic shim can be affixed but if they are missing, you will have to replace the entire bottom piece or attach a larger adhesive piece rather than mold a new replacement in the part.Sadly I do not sync after every photo. :) My question is in the "difficult" category.iPhone 4, iOS 4.3.somethingI'm afraid I do not have a backup of these photos.This week Apple released Numbers, Pages and Keynote for iPhone. They were previously available for Mac and iPad only. Now you can create and edit documents made in these apps right on your iPhone. No sure they'll work with Microsoft Office file formats but still worth a look if you're open to ditching Office altogether.No, they never stopped loading, and canceling and retrying didn't help. DNS was also one of the things i ended up trying, and changed it from Google's (which i had before) to my ISP's. This combined with running "Diagnostics" from network preferences seems to have fixed things, at least for the sites i had problems with. Still no idea what has caused the problem or if it's gone for good, but at least it seems to work now.Sadly, you're in the hurt locker with iPhone 4 and iOS 4.3 or higher. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4175 - you enabled data protection which means the filesystem was encrypted and the erase destroyed the key. You will need industrial grade forensics to get things back if the phone was powered off immediately after the erase. Using it will rapidly overwrite the scrambled data irreversably.That hack was to add four-finger gestures to older multitouch trackpads before snow leopard came out, not to add gestures to non-multitouch trackpads.move that comment into your answer and you win.sudo nvram target-mode=1 also helps to ssh into the mini if the machine is running already with some OS.Wow, that's great!

I have rolled back the edit, so if you'd like, cut it down, but please leave the question intact.You could just disable all internet connections temporarily. Maybe that would work - or maybe it just restarts, I never tried it.we're going to need a lot more information to help you out. Exactly what went wrong? What was the unexpected behavior, and were there any error messages? Also, what sites is this a problem with? Thanks.@Cawas btw in this image http://i.imgur.com/LpRg0.png what does it mean if push is not available fetch is used? aren't push and fetch completely different things?ok btw guys i only have 1 @gmail.com account so those accounts that i've darkened out all refers to the same accountAlso, consider a filing a feature request with Apple.@Pacerier: Push = service is actively pushing data to your phone. Fetch = phone is periodically fetching data from the service. Manual = phone fetching data from the service only when you run Contacts/Mail/Calendar app.gls (gnu ls) I mentioned in my answer can take a --style= flag where you can specify a +FORMAT string, so you can make the date appear whatever way you wish.Is this a programming question?No, and I flagged for it to be moved.Which python are you using?no, it doesn't work. Tried both, and back and forth, and it's still showing "Automatic"!!Thanks.Before I start I have a Sony HDR-CX6EK that produces Avchd 1080i videos.If I understand correctly so I would  need to convert (for editing purpose)my .mt2s files to another format in both windows and mac environment?then I would need to de-interlace them (both windows and mac)? if this is correct how much time this workflow will take? and am I losing quality? whenever I decide to take them back to .mt2s i need to do the inverse? (interlace and convert back to avchd).Did you try to send an email? It didn't change the value on my computer either, but it might still work.All I need is to install a driver that will enable me to open its window from an TWAIN enabled application.As Peter said, push and fetch are different indeed, but complementary. Fetch is basically used on iPhone to save battery life. I only asked about it because google said something about it on the help - though I'm not sure it's anything related to syncing contacts.@Pacerier so let's not discard the really slim possibility of something broken either on your phone or your google account, and try it in different mediums as I've suggested. Get someone's iPhone who got the contact syncing working and change places: your account on his phone, his account on your phone. That should pinpoint the problem.related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14837/what-cheap-option-is-there-to-use-a-mac-to-produce-quality-videosongsHi Moshe, Sorry to hear that. Procedurally, that was wrong of the Apple employee. They cannot stop you from paying for a replacement screen, even if you've previously had an unauthorized replacement performed. The only time Apple Stores can legitimately refuse to repair a device, even with a cost, is when the device itself has been damaged beyond any possibility to recover parts for possible refurbishment (ie. in pieces).@luca pros use Final Cut Pro or Adobe. That's all. By the way, great answer, Drew!@sujith1406 and be ready for another 4gb download for any **update**... That's just how it works.@luca, nuc's answer is quite technical and require deeper studying. if you're not willing to google yourself in hours of reading, you should probably try Drew's answer first and see if that works out as it's much simpler - and I'd say much more automatic too, if it works! :P Though it's obviously more limited as well, it should be enough.No way to restrict individual apps there.Anyway, you shouldn't "take them back" to .mt2s, it's not the best format to backup videos. Instead, use either mpeg or webm, good well spread default standards. And you got the original as well, if you really want to save 'em for any obscure reason. You're not losing quality and this workflow can take about 10 minutes to a few hours or days depending on the length of the video, the machine, experience and tools. I'd say not much more than 2 hours in ideal conditions but still depending on the length of the video and machine.I'm having the same problem. It was working a week ago, just suddenly stopped showing the "Shared" icon under "More". I've disabled home sharing on itunes and my iphone, i reset my iphone and enabled Home Sharing again on both devices. Still, nothing! I'm rattled! I'm pretty good a troubleshooting these kinds of kinks but this one has got me scratching my head.I think you might be confused. There is no standard ruby in `/usr/local/bin/` do you mean `/usr/bin/` ?If your MBP is fairly new there is a copy of XCode 4 on your applications disk.

Maybe this can help you figure out the differences.@luca One of my friends is a serious film editor, and he films with a professional grade Sony HD Camera (not sure the model) that shoots 1080, but when he uses MPEG Stream Clip he converts it to just a regular .mov file. Every editor can read that. He does it at the highest quality file though. (Obviously it's HD)You're right. I meant /usr/binIt includes the iOS SDK http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12#@Peter Stibrany so does it mean manual is best? (since i'll only need my contacts whenever i use those apps that need my contacts right..?Ugh, I can not express to you how much I loath Growl. It's even worse that tons of apps (like Dropbox) install it silently without asking, or simply crash and burn (like Max) if it isn't installed without giving you any error messages or means of troubleshooting.Giving this a down-vote because there's an answer about Homebrew and I want it bubbled up to the top. If others think the same, please up- and down-vote accordingly.Also now available on the iPhone 4 as well. Very handy.1Password is cross platform as well, and MUCH more popular.Maybe Apple will transition the iOS App Store into the App Store app on Lion, and open up the APIs for backup/sync so developers can make third party replacements for iTunes! But probably not.1Password's UI is slow and clunky, but I can't argue with the app's effectiveness. Didn't Lastpass recently have a security breach? I prefer 1Password as it leaves me in control of my password file with Dropbox.This is awesome. There's an OS X app called Notational Velocity (that's also open source) that also syncs with Simplenote, and can be set to store notes in my Dropbox. This keeps my notes backed up locally, in the cloud, and in Simplenote's server as well as being editable across any platform. Such a great app/service.Annoyed that it doesn't let me do scaling to make images smaller for sending MMS, but it's good for the couple limited things it does.Down-voted because TomTom takes your location and speed data and sells it to the Police. The Police then use it to set up speed traps or to use against you should you decide to take a ticket to court.@Bryson I wouldn't put my hand on fire for any company, but you're making a very bold allegation there. Can you cite some sources or make some sense of this? Plus it's not like any of those GPS apps are so reliable to be taken as an evidence in court, I'd guess.@Bryson Nope, no security breach. Lastpass recently had a supsect of anomalous behavior on their network and they took preventive measures about it. Nobody ever complained on losing anything stored on lastpass as far as I know, and that measure was very well seem and documented on the web. Just look for it. You can't arguee with this app's effectiveness, UI or service, but I can arguee against a lack of offering backup from my point of view - which reminds me of *Crashplan vs Carbonite*, the later being the pop-pretty one, but the former being the rock-solid-actually-much-better solution.@Bryson indeed, and I'm already using it. :)@EmmyS is it getting really hot?No, the bundle on the App Store includes the SDK.So glad a summary helped. It's a common failing - writing by experts that already have processed the steps and how things work. Seeing headless installation once or twice is an eye opener indeed.@Harv, it does get really hot, but it seems kind of strange that it would be pretty much the exact same time every time, and only if it's untouched for more than 60 minutes. It's never restarted while I'm actually working, only when it's idle.Nice list of X11 programs +1 http://sourceware.org/xconq/ is the only X11 program I still use regularly on my mac.ssh tunneling is CRITICAL for security when X11 traffic routes outside a locally secure network (if there ever was such a thing).

But thanks for the Q, and I would love to know if you ever give it a go.this depends on which shell you are usingThanks @styfle - sadly that script reads a list of songs that are in a genius playlist (iTunes does the genius selecting) and doesn't access genius metadata or status directly.I'm loathe to make yet another account to test - but agree that the question in the abstract is a good one and over time should hold the authoritative answer to your question. Many others will end up in the same boat in time.Are you looking for a partition scheme that works on both operating systems or just to erase the mac partition format and data on the drive and let windows (linux) see the drive as GUID format?I'd wager the preference pane is calling dscl and not passwd :-)Engadget had an article a couple weeks ago about it. TomTom sold data to the Dutch police force, who then used it to set up speed traps based on the speed and location data. TomTom said they were shocked that the police would do this. I'm not sure what else they expected them to use it for when they sold it to them. http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/27/tomtom-user-data-sold-to-danish-police-used-to-determine-ideal/The vendor really has to work with Apple to either provide Apple with the details of their keyboards so that ships with the OS or provide a file (hopefully less than a kernel extension) to let OS X automagically recognize their hardware so the key layout works when hot plugged.No, I'm looking for a partition scheme.thankyou. Indeed it worked. :)GUID partition scheme is the best as long as your PC OS supports it. You might ask this on superuser since some mac users may know the answer, but PC users will be more versed in linux / windows and GUID. The mac drives are simply pre-formatted in APM - repartitioning it anywhere will do the trick.@mankoff, thanks for the edit. Appreciate it!This is a classic "fast, cheap, good" dilemma. Good + Fast = Expensive, Good + Cheap = Slow and Fast + Cheap = Inferior - All of the cheap plug-ins I have seen for iMovie have bad reviews for crashing on clips that are more than 30 seconds long.in what format is the hard drive formatted in?Not to mention blind users.@bmike I hear you there, and I'm certainly looking for good+cheap.+1: I never thought of Quartz Composer; that's a fantastic idea.Some of the older Apple keyboards had a more pronounced curvature of those keys. Many PC keyboards have lines on the D and K instead (for the middle fingers, instead of the index).@NReilingh Really? I've never seen a board with D and K accented. As a curiosity, I'd love to see a photo of one like that if you can find one.You'll see the same thing on telephones. The numeral '5' will have some sort of tactile cue on it. Same goes for ATM keypads as well.Nice. Any idea where chrome stores passwords? I can't imagine that Chrome would sync passwords up to my Google account, so it must be storing them locally.Quartz Composer is stunningly elegant, powerful and you could write a PHD thesis on computer visualization or graphics modeling and barely touch one tenth of it's power.You can still shop the UK store no matter where you are worldwide so you only need a second account if you choose to shop both stores for availability, pricing or whatever other difference you feel is important.@Nathan: http://www.old-computers.com/museum/photos/Apple_III_Keyboard_s1.jpg and http://bzupages.com/attachments/2304d1226874682-macplus_keyboard-jpgany one tried 4 finger gesture on solid-state scrolling tracking with Better Touch Tool? I don't know how to configure it on my MacBookCan you tell us a little about your Spotlight prefs?But Quartz Composer can also be a pain in the ass sometimes. As far as I know you can't get the video out of Quartz as the "Export as QuickTime Movie" doesn't work with imported video clips.Does this happen on other computers?want a sort of incremental backup (like TimeMachine), or only a simple copy of current files?Yes but the question is is X11 of use - not how to use ssh ie if no X11 then no issue hereJust simple copy of files of specific type. The files will be access by both Windows and Mac OS'sIs the backup bootable when using the "incremental backup of selected objects"-option of CCC?I think so http://help.bombich.com/kb/troubleshooting/what-makes-a-volume-bootableThanks, my videos are scattered all across my iMac, I geuss I should move them into one location first ? or can script be amended to find all vidoes?Thank you, sounds perfect!The script looks at all directories under the SRV directoryThe above script find **all** avi, mov, and mp4 videos (defined by file extension) which are anywhere in the "source_tree". Will copy them into "dest". Can you define what extensions want? Or i should modify the script find really all video files everywhere on your mac, but taht type of script will run really LONG (several 10 minutes).analysing files regardless their extension is not the best idea. so would be helfull, if you can provide a list of extensions - what want backing up. And really want search your WHOLE mac? not only your HOME?`c:\xampp\apache\conf`? As in c:, the windows partition? Also who uses XAMPP? Apache is already installed on OS X.I downloaded the smart reporter but it reports that everything is OK.Thanks @VxJasonVx +1It's a limited edition, marked with my initials. Please return all hardware that have them to me.most likely a hardware problem which needs replacing. I don't really think that there is a solution other than opening the case and messing around with it (which voids the warranty)I could easily see how engineering would hard code the headset since if there were an incoming call, people would expect to default to answering the call and them deciding to make someone that wants to listen to music go and choose stereo. Your question makes great sense and your use case is clear - just that I could see how adding code to allow you to "forever more use only (or prefer) stereo" might not have been undertaken. It's certainly not something you can click in the settings and may not exist at the driver level.This just reboots the daemon and doesn't reset the files.@Aziz Interesting; I've never seen that before. Thanks for the links!I assume you've got the brightness all the way up?I can confirm that this doesn't happen on Snow Leopard. Is it possible you're using a different version of Mac OS X?As good as benchmarks are - they are of limited use in the real world. Putting a jet engine on a bicycle will benchmark really well but not be so useful in practice. Feel free to run the numbers, but what really matters is placing your mac next to that air in the store and opening iPhoto and scrolling around. Playing videos, playing games. The solid state drive on the air will make it so ridiculously faster for anything but a render fest / video frame rate match that you might not care about benchmarks if it's faster for what you actually do.Agree with you : logic board replacement seems overkill (for now). Have you tried the same thing on a fresh OS X Install? You could just try to boot from the OS X Install CD to see if the same problem appears.It won't work as the software can't imagine where 4 fingers are when the hardware will only report if one or two fingers are sensed during a scroll detection.You can hack the software all you want, but the hardware can't detect more than two contact points.Hey, great point. I had it not on another user's account but on another partition, and removing that fixed the problem Thanks!The fact that Mac apps can run from any location means that it's still installed if it's mounted anywhere. TimeMachine does hide the "previous" versions from the store, but I can see how a manual copy would confuse the app store since it truly is still runnable from anywhere.@EmmyS How hot?  If it's so hot that you can't touch it, or nearly so, and it's just running idle, there is definitely a problem that needs to be looked at.  Computers generally turn themselves off if they get *too* hot, in an attempt to prevent the CPU from burning up.  Sounds like a hardware problem to me, maybe the vents are clogged and not allowing air to flow freely.You can easily rebuild the index without command line or other tools by adding the hard drive to the privacy list and then removing it from that list. Click, click, click, done.That worked thanks!Thanks, you gave GEdgar the right direction, if I could put two correct answer...Definately get a second opinion. On that model a trained tech should reseat all cables, isolate the issue to Display, inverter or GPU/MLB. It's highly unlikely to be a power issue, but I have seen cases where insufficient internal power caused the display not to light but externals to work. Most techs can know MLB or Display if they see the failure, but if they have to guess and it's working when they see the mac - it's a bit of guess work to know until you start the repair.@luca The first conversion is almost instant. The de-interlacing though takes quite some time, based on the length of the video and on the power of your machine. iMovie can import the video directly from your camera, transcoding and deinterlacing it but the result is not so great. But this depends on your expectations for the final video. It might worth checking this out, as you might be ok with it. But if quality is really that important to you, then you'll have to take the hard path. I'm thinking about writing a blog post, to describe the workflow in full detail, so I'll let you know :)@luca p.s. whatever you decide, is really important to keep separate copies of the original mt2s files. First reason is that you can easily playback them on your tv using a WD TV Live or a similar player. But more importantly, you'll always have the original source files for whatever need.I'm not sure how this is possible, since MPEG StreamClip open file window, is not accepting m2ts files http://cl.ly/7KQR If there is a way to open them, I would love to know!Somewhat lazy I changed the IP settings from DHCP to static and set the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 That solved it.@nuc if this doesn't work, the answer loses half its value! :oiMovie couldn't import videos directly from my camera, I don't think it's as flexible as we'd expect or as we'd get from FinalCut.@Bryson I got the wrong impression from what you've said, and I think maybe you got the wrong impression from what happened too. It doesn't take *your location to the police*, it takes **anonymous** locations and speed data to them, and they retracted from doing it again because it was being used for speed traps. Again, I don't think they're that innocent, no big company is, but they also are very cautious on shooting their own feet like that. So, no, I don't think I agree with you on your worrying or protest - but thanks for bringing it up. It was an interesting view of the company.I downvoted this for several reasons, but mainly because it's such a big text that ultimately addresses almost nothing from the question or problem and adds no personal experience whatsoever. It's too vague and other than citing few good programs it's all of no use, from my point of view.So Mpeg streamClip not Working?@Nuc thanks! the last 2 questions! why if I try to play directly .mt2s on mac I can see very bad image but with my vaio laptop (that is quite older than my IMac)the image is perfect?there's a codec that I miss? or what? Let me know for the blog post..Would be nice if you explain the workflow for importing and editing .mt2s video for windows/mac point of view!..@Caffeine Coma: yes, Chrome syncs passwords too. I edited the end of my answer to show you all the things Chrome can automatically take care of in its sync.@Cawas Here's the list of iMovie's 11 compatible camcorders, btw: http://cl.ly/7KTU@luca Depending on the processing power of your iMac, VLC might be a good choice for playing back m2ts videos, using deinterlacing (Video > Deinterlace)Thanks for the reply. But, aside from browsing and writing, the one specialty role my MBP still fills is a second computer for playing low-requirement games with friends. I was just wondering if there was a handy bar graph or something floating around that compares Mac models' framerates under different GPU tasks. And even still, I didn't want to get more specific than "fine"/"not fine".Just the tool I was looking for. What would really be great would be a cumulative chart showing the performance of various Mac models on a single test. Something like the Geekbench Results Browser, but for an OpenMark test.As Macs close the walls more and more (ex Mac App Store) you won't have to. It'll all be done for you...No one has invented a .zip knock off that will automatically extract itself to the proper place (or a place of your choosing?)If you've got the Transmission web interface running, why not just open the .torrent file there? You can just paste in a .torrent link.Why not just share the web deployment folder with Windows? I don't see this as a reason to use DropBox.@slomojo I'm not always testing with a PC on my local network, so some sort of cloud-based sharing is better.@mankoff: How is making software easier to install and not adding any limitations as to how you can already install software "closing the walls"?If you look under sound outputs does the Airport Express show up as an available output?@Ian: System Preferences -> Sound -> Output does not show my Airport Express.+1 - Carbon Copy Cloner FTW!You really want a blank password? From a security perspective, that's not at all a good idea.then really you should be deploying to a test server, than mucking about with a shonky DropBox solution. - You can just have a script run to do your FTP / SFTP / Rsync or whatever, I don't really understand the "Saves me having to FTP", since you still (I assume) manually throw the files at DropBox.Good to know and sad that my wish option is not possible.The new Air are very fine for anything except the most demanding 3D gaming. Anandtech is a great place for benchmarks. http://www.anandtech.com/show/3991/apples-2010-macbook-air-11-13inch-reviewed@Mark Szymanski - Probably because the only way to get your app into the mac store is go through apple, and apple have a **lot** of limitations on what your software can and cannot do.Well there's self extracting stuff, but that's basically a dumbed down installer, which - again - is a folder on OS X. Also it's fairly insecure to just let it install wherever it wants to. I suppose apple could have just wrapped up a file extension (say .appzip) which would be just a renamed zip file, which extracts itself into `/Applications` when executed, but I don't exactly know why they didn't. Maybe it's just for historical reasons.Regarding "or a place of your choosing": most extraction apps (The Unarchiver at least) can be configured to ask for a destination folder when extracting files.Mark, as much as I hate to say it, there are very significant functionality limitations enforced on apps submitted to the Mac App Store.This is great for working with text files, but will fail when you try to perform the task with binaries. Try this out with an image to see what I mean.You're right about images, etc. I didn't think of that. I guess I've misunderstood the question, because although `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` will work with an .html file, that's only because it just happens to be a text file.No, you understood the question correctly, it's just that you assumed these tools worked as they should, which they do not. They're buggy, and aren't even meant to work that way, though Apple has done a really poor job on documentation. If you type in `pbcopy -help`, you get a non-production-worthy `NSLog()` line just repeating `'pbcopy -help'`. It helps to be a programmer to understand this, which is why I felt it necessary to chime in.Wow, that's very shoddy work. I'd never done `pbcopy -help` before. `man pbcopy` isn't too comprehensive either now that I've taken a look at it. Thanks for pointing these things out to me.Yep, no problem. ;)Saurik, of course, knows nothing about what Apple does and does not check for, nor how they check. Apple doesn't need to read your source code to know what system calls you're making or what data your app is accessing or sending. He's right about the address book and your location: it's possible that an app that doesn't do that during the first few minutes of its operation might slip by. You can know, however, that said apps aren't accessing your email, your phone messages, your SMS messages, passwords or account information in other apps, etc.@Pieter As you can see in britta's answer, no, Cydia doesn't screen anything.Ironically, I had spaces lock up my keyboard 4 times while writing this. I think I made it angry.after typing $ cat ~/Desktop/ded.html | pbcopy I can not use cmd+v to paste the file. Althought $ pbpaste > ~/Documents/ded.html did the job.If you do not yet have an Input Menu in your menu bar, go to System Preferences > Language and Text > Input Sources to add it.  Probably French OS X has different names for these...At what kinds of places do you work on-site that provide (or even allow!) a Mac?  I'm jealous!Why the downvote ("not a useful answer")?  Though there may be better ways in *your* particular situation, that doesn't make it un-useful in someone else's.  The poster stipulated "trusted friend" - that could include working at different times; with live coordination via, e.g., Skype or IM, or another agreed-upon means of avoiding walking on one-another's work. +1.But still, that doesn't limit what you can already install through the normal methods.@slomojo No, I don't manually throw the files at Dropbox, because that kind of defeats the purpose of Dropbox. So, yes, it does save me a lot of work. Really, it would be much more work to "muck about" with an FTP script than to let Dropbox do its thing. I don't have to muck about with that at all.My neww iPhone 4 will NOT connect to the Prius about 90% of the time. I often have to try and connect numerous times just to get one friggin' connection. This was not an issue with the iPhone 3. It bothers me that Apple will not address this issue. They know about it. I have tried everything, and a delay of xx number of seconds makes no difference whatsover.so where do you find the option in the "router" or any other device settings.
for example I have an iphone tethered with tetherme
and when I try to connect via wifi, it gets me the "WIFI has a self assigned IP of 169.254.206.101 and will not be able to connect"
on the other hand MiFI does not have this problemAnyone who wants pbcopy to get some attention might get a free developer account and file some bugs - https://bugreport.apple.com - no guarantee it will help, but it gives the engineers leverage to get time to work on these things if enough people still care.I understand that more RAM will be faster, but I want to make sure I'm getting all of the bang for my RAM buck. So, yes, 12GB is faster than 4 GB, but is 4GB of matching RAM faster than 4 GB of unmatching RAM?I'm going to be buying the machine through Amazon, so I don't have the option to replace the RAM at purchase like I could buying directly from Apple.Keep in mind that zeroing out an SSD is _highly_ unlikely to truly zero out the disk since SSD's have wear-leveling features that avoid touching parts too many times too quickly (so as to prolong the life expectency of the SSD).Did you know that you can actually share folders in Dropbox? No need to give them dropbox details (I assume you mean username/password), let them create their own dropbox account and share a folder with them. It works nicely and it even gives you some additional space for free.@Mark there are no limits yet on the desktop. Plenty on an iPad. Wait a while, I think the trend is clear...Thanks for the reproduction, even if it yielded a different result. Yes, I tried to remove the font and then reinstalled it without no luck.@Uwe I tried Inconsolada in Mail as well, and it worked without a problem. I played around with different sizes, font smoothing, etc and I can't reproduce your problem.@mankoff: Do you seriously think that Apple would ruin their OS by putting that limitation on it?Have you tried to *Validate Font* in *Font Book*?+1 for illustrating why saying it like Mac O S Ten causes a problem. However, I think Apple would probably respond by saying that you should really be saying "Mac OS Ten Snow Leopard", or just Snow Leopard rather than "Mac OS Ten 10.6" :)Have you considered switching to another program or service? If you're using a Mac, iCal is quite good. If you're using Windows, you could try using MobileMe or Google Calendar. (I know this doesn't answer your question, but it might help remove your problem)It's pretty off-topic but the amount of caffeine that you can tolerate is highly dependent on your body build and the amount of caffeine you usually have in your body (as resistance build up). So I'd say it's almost impossible to get accurate numbers. But maybe you should try kicking the habit for good, then you wouldn't need it at all after a while.Define 'ruin'. It isn't ruined if the majority of people want it, or think they want it, or Apple gets lucrative media deals because they can enforce better DRM.@XQYZ I kicked the habit a while ago (like 2 years ago), but I'm having difficulty without it, which is why I'm asking this question.Can the OP achieve what they want with AppleScript on the CLI?Thanks a lot.  It worked.@Teresa Great! Glad to hear itAlt+Shift+( et Alt+Shift+). Vindiou not that easy to find :) Good luck if you're stuck coding Objective-C with a french keyboard... I mapped them to F5/F6...Matthew is correct here, though it's important to note that audits of applications do take place by Apple at random. This is a logical limit due simply to resources available and the sheer number of apps requiring attention.I'm also interested to hear about this. I know someone experiencing the same issue, and we've narrowed it down to the iTunes installation, however reinstalling it doesn't fix the problem.Except this doesn't apply to SSDs because of wear-levelling.The subject says SSD, that's why everyone jumped on the idea.To a point, yes. However, it won't offer 100% security against data recovery later due to the wear-levelling.I don't think so. Sorry for late answer.I'll second this. I use it and it works as advertised, plus it's free.Haha! Thanks. Didn't even catch that.Can you replicate with dragging just one file at a time?This isn't a forum. Please keep it relevant to the original question.The iPad does see the network, and gives me a password prompt which I enter and click Join, but then it alerts - Unable to join the network "Magnum"It sees all networks, and is up to date. I did all the steps in the article except updating my router firmware... ugh, I suppose that's next.thought about version control at all, it would do this all much better. Seems to me you couldn't manage too many sites in this DropBox manner.So if the iPad can connect to other networks, then yes, router firmware is a good call, as the next step would be restoring the device.This question is on-topic for Ask Different. It is just a software-recommendation, and we allow plenty of those questions. If you have downvoted because you feel this is off-topic, please consider removing the downvote. Thanks.@Nathan Thanks, that was my thinking on it.That seems like it has potential... thanks :)Yes, that's most likely possible. I'll have to look into the Finder's scripting definitions to let you know for sure. I mean, of course you can get AppleScript to simulate ?C and ?V in the Finder, but you can also get the work done manually, I'm guessing.Do you mean CAD/CAE apps that run natively on OSX, or apps that are run on a remote machine and then displayed on the Mac via X11?I bought the SSD separately and replaced it with the standard hard drive before selling the old MBP. I always do a clean OS X install with a new Mac.Change the background color of the stroke, or the slide?thanks.  I tried both of your suggestions but it did not resolve the problem.+1 mobile mouse is great!If you've tested multiple browsers, then I would consider (if you haven't already), foregoing Flash and using HTML5 on Youtube to see if it reoccurs. Otherwise, try another website like Vimeo and see if there's consistency in the problem.Thanks!   I'll check it out.  With VLC, you can manually delay the audio (f and g hotkeys.)  I wish Apple would expose an interface for its Airport Express so that the VLC people and browser people could integrate it.Normally, yes. Either your iTunes library or your iOS device is likely qualified for a different account. Play it like you're going to lose your data and do the sync. The only way to bypass the process at this point is to modify the iPhone further through Installous and other packages.If the issue persists even with the font cache rebuild, you could try a Terminal.app alternative like iTerm or GLTerm and test further.So which one you actually mean? "How can I capture the whole screen down the scrollbar to the bottom to an image" or "How can I save my SMS text messages"?Run on a server somewhere, display on whatever in on the desk.+1 @bmike has it right: the device literally cannot detect what you want it to detect. It's as if you asked, "how can I get my MacBook's SuperDrive to also read 3.5 inch floppy disks?"; the electro-mechanical device is simply incapable of doing what you want, no matter how you modify the software.Ditto. I've not heard of this either.Personally, I find the rotation aspect of the iPad's homescreen to be a pretty bad feature, since it screws up the location of my (very) carefully arranged icons. I have had to resort to additional hacks to get a square grid (7x7, in my case) to ensure that when rotated, the icons are always still in the same position. Something to think about when you try SBRotator -- I suggest keeping your homescreen layout square (4x4, 5x5, etc.).It works, but I dislike the implementation of the rotating homescreen on the iPad, so I gave up on it on my iPhone. If Apple had done it *right* (keeping icons in the right spot), I wouldn't dislike that feature so much.I did warn you! But hey, WWDC is tomorrow with iOS5 preview. Maybe we'll get some screen rotation too.I can also confirm that I can use Inconsolata in Terminal without incident. It also works fine in iTerm (which also has a few other nice features), so that might be your next step to see if it is just specific to Terminal or something else is going on.Oh, so can't wait until the iOS5 preview... so many possibilities. :-)Well the only way to fix that is to get a software called "anacron". It's apparently available from fink. The standalone version was compiled for Tiger, so I have no idea if that works on anything newer. Also I've never set it up on OS X, but there's probably a ton of Linux guides for it which should be transferable.Yes, I did a validation of the loaded font in *Font Book* and all went well. According to *Font Book* the font is safe to use.Thanks for your response. I tried but did not succeed. The problem still persists.Is this referring to [Automatically Add to iTunes](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3832) because I don't understand how this relates to Dropbox.They arent embedded in the mp3. They are just present in the folder. Doesnt itunes detect that, and use it for album art preview?There was consistency, it was with anything Flash in Firefox after Firefox had been running for a while. Thanks for reminding me of this question, so please check out my update to this answer if you're interested.No. See @Mark Szymanski's Answer for instructions.Well, if HTML5 worked properly, and Flash consistently had issue, I'd manually remove the Flash plugin files (/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/), reinstall Adobe Flash, and test further. You mention Firefox, so again, I'm assuming you've tested other browsers. If it's only inside of one, then it changes the support path significantly.That will work, but is *very* tedious for my ~100 GB library. I will keep looking for other methods.I'm afraid that this is probably the only method.That is the only method.You're kidding right? I don't know about your library but I already pass 1Tb of photos a long time ago!I have a Flickr Pro account and that is not what I want to do.That'd normally fall under the idea of 'deleting' photos.I'm not going to delete good photos! ;)I have tried all the steps by signout process as well... but that APP is totally idle no changes in that.. still in downloading mode with 0% status... its just a brand new white iphone.... do u want me to reset that ? How can i do that ? or is there any other way to remove that particular app only ?It seems that everything is integrated into Firefox these days. That's a really weird use of a browser, IMO. Completely different from something such as phpSqLite.I tried all of the steps above with no luck.  I also created a new user account and the problem occurs in that account as well.care the downvoter tell me what is wrong with my reply?I was hopping to a combination that uses only the left hand :)this worked for me, thanks@Sorin: it's possible to press it with right hand altogether, using right-Cmd and right-Shift keys :-). I've just tried it, but I have to admit, it's not very "hand"-friendly (I use left hand for cmd and shift keys).Hmm, the Likewise solution sounds a bit big just to solve the login delays.Unfortunately this conflicts with Eclipse/XCode code completion :-(I use package managers which build from source to see where the issues are and how they were fixed - so I can just look at the patches from the package manager to see the issues - or for python just get it from python.orgHave you tried using VGA at that resolution with another computer?Sadly does nothing. Maybe it's a different combo when using a Finnish layout.I assume you have and addional `\\` key on your keyboard between Shift and Z ... but this is not my case.OK. I will be curious if you find a another solution. I opted for Likewise since we use it on our Linux servers at work. Works like a charm, and life has been much less frustrating since I made the leap.Well, I used VGA port from another PC attached to the same monitor and worked well. I may have found solution to my problem, but not the cause. Still investigating.@Sorin: I have additional \ key next to Enter key, just above right shift key (http://i53.tinypic.com/2jdkiew.png) I think this is what Apple calls "International keyboard layout".just one question: why?As for the hosts file, you shouldn't remove that entry and there shouldn't be any entry there beforehand for you to remove. If you want to block access to gs.apple.com you should **add an entry** such as `127.0.0.1 gs.apple.com` and have no other line pointing to it. About the rest of the issue... I don't get it. I'd try getting another device to restore in this iTunes and if you are not trying to recover yours, I'd also/either try restoring the same device on another mac's iTunes - just to pin point where exactly the issue is. But please, do explain better what you **want** to do!how is screenrecycler different from http://synergy-foss.org/  ?very nice idea (from James that is)!Yeah but it's not the same is it? Synergy is pretty much an automatic keyboard-mouse switch whereas ScreenRecycler is using the second computer's display as a display for your first computer.@XQYZ - youre right. The synergy is only a sort of kvm. So, you can share your mouse and keyboard between more systems, but does not externd the current system with a second display.figured out a fix - answer coming soon@Cawas: Because there are times, like now where I'm switching from one landscaping typing situation to another. I have a Bluetooth keyboard that I use and a few apps that I use as well with it. I was hoping to have a way that landscape would be kept throughout.@XQYZ you are right. Guess I was a bit too jumpyThanks. It's a company computer, so I'm guessing there's some kind of support contract. I'll check with my boss.@Harv, no, not so hot that I can't even touch it. And it's on one of those riser things to keep air flowing under it.Good to know there's still plenty of vitriol in the Mac community and it's not just limited to the Linux and Windows communities. Geeks are geeks after all. :)honestly didn't understand too, why simply do not use os x natively and sometimes (in rare cases) you can boot parallels desktop for the Losedows. ;)@Kyle Cronin - can you please tell me, than the font is shown in the "Fixed width" fonts? (in the Font panel, like Monaco or Courier?)Interesting about the warranty. Thanks for the info.I'll get a flashlight and check it out. Thanks.Looked good, but then I saw you have to pay. Not worth it right now for the value of my app.I've only tried on the "tester" side. How much is it to post an app?Unfortunately, when I use CCC for an incremental backup, it just runs `rsync` and I get the same result :-(No matter what I have tried, I can't get rsync to copy the resource forks, I think because the ZFS system doesn't support them... I'm not sure. I first tried with a Debian kBSD server, but have switched to Nexenta (OpenSolaris kernel + Debian core) because it has NFS and Netatalk support.When you dump your drive to the network drive, what hosts the network drive? OS X? Linux? How do you connect? Samba? AFP? Do you use CCC direct to the network drive, or, do you go to a DMG on the network drive?And the 3rd link? (that show a OS/FS independendent solution)Rather than re-invent TimeMachine using open source/unixy tools (which I adore and love) - have you considered running the free CrashPlan software on both machines? They are giving away software that is very advanced and well supported if you need help from them.@Josh: You could CCC to the mounted Disk ImageThat's what I was doing -- and CCC was running `rsync` and I was getting the same I/O errors :-(Could you clarify if there are any quicklookd messages in the console app (all messages and system.log) and also check chat quicklookd is actually running. There are two avenues to pursue to resolve this - knowing the status of quicklookd will help narrow down the issue.Hmmm, I'll have to look into that! The reason I'm "re-inveting" TimeMachine, FYI, is that TimeMachine requires a large USB drive for each machine, and in our setup we don't have that, rather, we have a massive onsite backup RAID.This is a fantastic idea. I'll try that after I finish work for the day!@jm666 Not by default, but that doesn't mean anything - font categories need to be managed manuallyApple has made clear to developers that apps are sandboxed is primarily for security and secondarily for stability/performance.If you've followed all the steps I listed and it persists, the end recommendation was, again, to hard reset the unit, or restore. Please see Apple's Troubleshooting Assistant: http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/assistant/phone/i'm really interested in this. Here is another link for zfs + timemachine. http://blogs.oracle.com/constantin/entry/zfs_and_mac_os_xConfirmed, the TTF also works on my computer. OTF doesn't. Strange, but at least I'm now able to use the font. +1I totally get your reasons. ZFS is great and reusing existing infrastructure makes so much sense. For several clients with 10 to 30 macs - the sweet spot has been a mac mini server sharing one drive to all mac clients for Time Machine. That server has crash plan to the main server for tape/offsite rotations (and the sparsebundles encapsulate HFS and metadata). DeployStudio handles the bootable images and net restores. Good Luck and let us know how it goes.Also - if you make a new user on the mac - does that user's newly created home folder have black icons as well?Thanks for the suggestion. Can beaTunes show me which songs don't have a genius match? It looks like an alternative to genius - I'm really looking for the outliers and not a different way to group songs based on another algorithm.I have not seen any benchmarks or real world experience where running a pair of 2G chips slowed down a pair of 4G chips. These machines will scream with 8G and you'll be running at 12. The i5 and i7 chips need quality fast ram - but as long as the ram you add is proper speed/timing/voltage etc... you will get the best bang/buck by using the 4G that came with the mac. Don't remove the 2x2 until you need more total ram than you can afford with it still installed.David - this software is great for changing how multi touch is interpreted but doesn't add multi touch where there is none.Ah, I see, you're mounting the directory and `rsync` ing locally! I was trying to rsync from the Mac to the server! I will try this and get back to you.The hogging means it has more work to do than the CPU can dispatch at a lower utilization level. NAT translates packets, so if you can change your network to have less NAT traffic, the CPU load will go down. If you can't or won't modify your network, then you can turn off internet sharing on your CPU and add a dedicated NAT device for routing that traffic and have your CPU to yourself without it being loaded down.I'd play around with Command+Option+~ etc. The tilde on a Finnish keyboard is opposite the standard US English one, and it appears to need a modifier to access.No, you'll have to rely on your memory or a self-made list of songs that don't play with Genius. It's a fault of iTunes' Genius database, and since BeaTunes relies on an entirely different system, they don't mesh in any way.Sadly - it looks like the modem is getting your CPU stuck in a loop processing packets after the disconnect. Although it could be a Mac bug, it's more likely something from the modem. I've gone to a MiFi card to avoid my mac from running NAT and being less secure since internet sharing pokes holes in the firewall.It will allow gestures on any hardware that has the underlying technology to recognize input from x number of fingers. That's all one could ever hope for.+1 - I was thinking of a way to use iSCSI to get you there and encapsulate the mac specific data. The less steps, the better.CMD-Shift-T for new window of the same project might help you, but I agree it is annoying.But were here answering 2009 MacBook questions where the OP wants multitouch on hardware that isn't. It's a great answer, just not for this question.Sure, in the character-table I can find it pretty well, but there should, or must, be a shortcut for at least the tilde.Another +1 to @bmike's CrashPlan suggestion. Uses Hadoop under the hood and can do incrementals like TimeMachine. Free to push backups to another drive or computer. UI isn't as nice as TimeMachine though.Wow nice job Nuc - thank you![citation needed]Not likely. I'm looking for full details of a calendar invitation. I have co-workers who sometimes include a 10 point agenda plus a couple paragraphs of explanatory information in the body of the invitation. It's *that* stuff that I want to print.Thank you! (for the answer and the comment)@Cawas Normally "I'm attempting to restore iOS 4.3.2 on to my iPhone 3GS" would be sufficient. As for the hosts file, the entry there previously was to redirect the connection to the server, as per the hosts file's function. 4.x firmwares are still signed by Apple and hence gs.apple.com is required to be open for a normal restore/update, which is what I am attempting to do.Did you check the virtual on-screen keyboard in Hiragana mode?**Important:** Verizon and AT&T iPhones have different antennas. They are *NOT* compatible with each other's networks.Dead pixels on current models are no more or less common than the previous units. It's rare, and quality is still at a premium. To obtain a virtually perfect record against these failures would increase cost significantly.And since new sign-ups are closed, we'll have to see what happens with iCloud this fall but you will be able to keep your Mobile Me until June 30, 2012 and have lots of time to decide what to do once the new service goes live.Can you even obtain a copy of Xcode that will run on your system?The sample itself is in the ROM, but it plays at whatever volume was left when shutting down, so a solution like the mentioned prefpane should work.Any comments on how accurate a GPS unit with WAAS is? Thank you.which one you did in the end? how did it go?Yeah, I would've thought it was rare. But I had concerns when my replacement laptop had exactly the same problem (but in a different location). I've been using laptops for years, and this is the first time I'd ever encountered this problem. Thankfully my replacement replacement didn't have this problem. :-)Always a good idea to wait at least a reasonable period of time before upgrading. (Oh, and have a good backup before doing the deed!)You _might_ want to give it some time, what with the recent announcements at WWDC, the app-store may be a little glitchy. See how it fares tomorrow. Also, have you done a full reboot (holding down LOCK until you get the "swipe to turn off" message)? Just checking; a reboot nearly always clears these things up for me.I dont know what happen.. when i plugged my iphone with macbook... my problems got resolved... apps has been downloaded automatically. Thanks :)Fluke is a hack, not a solution. I can get it to work for a single song but I can't be tagging hundreds of albums. The SetOGG script also does not work anymore. The reason it's not working might be a little too technical for this site (missing functions in the python API shipped with Mac OS X).Yojimbo looks promising! It looks, however, like there's only the single repository of info?The console is reporting this error:  7/06/11 5:53:58 PM com.apple.quicklook[4195] /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd: /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd: cannot execute binary filequicklookd is not running.

But how would DLing a nightly build of webkit improve the workflow over using my safari as is?@mankoff, I did. It doesn't support the conversion of html files to pdf. It supports: txt, html, rtf, rtfd, doc, docx, wordml, odt, or webarchiveI know about `pdftk`, and probably it's possible using it to write some script adding my timestamp to each page. But this does not solve the integration problem into the printing system -- the solution is sort of unusable if I have to go to the console pre-processing every PDF file I want to print.This was pretty simple in the end, posted an answer.(Win|Lose)dows is harming your computer. :)Xcode 4 only has one window (by default), so Cmd-` wouldn't have done anything.Bah! *Just* as I was typing that this is working great, the connection was lost. But I still have hope for this solution...ah yes, I always forget that services are controlled using the keyboard prefs! Unlogical to say the least. Thanks!Unless this has been specifically answered by Apple in a public forum, I'd imagine anyone who knows the answer to this is under NDA and thus won't be able to talk about it here.Thanks, someone with years of experience is exactly whom I was hoping to hear from!Was about 12 hours for me.@calum wow that was a quick reply lol thnx@Drew think of this way: how is "automatically extracting itself to a proper place or a place of your choosing" any easier than giving a shortcut to the default (proper) place and allowing you to move it to any place of your choosing through using the OS own means? Well, I answer you: it's not. This is just a paradigm of what you're used to do.XQYZ there's at least one added benefit of using DMG - it will keep file permissions as they were intended to be. I've had issues using ZIP to "install" software before, mostly because I was using an alternate unzipper app, but nevertheless even that's a risk DMG won't suffer.And if `~/Applications` doesn't exist? I just create one?
How will this affect complicated apps such as Matlab, which aren't really as drag-n-drop as the usual app?+1 for crashplan. It's a great piece of free software and has the added benefit that you can easily add more points of backup - including their own servers for a fee.Yes just create it.This will probably be sufficient for most practical purposes. But ideally, I suppose you'd also want to delete any preferences from /Library/Preferences (perhaps moving them to ~/Library/Preferences if the app hasn't already created a per-user prefs file there), and there may also be things in /Library/Application Support to think about moving to ~/Library/Application Support.yet now, I have two app folders in the Admin account. This might get frustrating no?@romeovs Re 'complicated' apps, it partly depends what your ultimate goal is. Is it to prevent your girlfriend from seeing them, or just from accidentally running them? And if it's the former, does it matter that she might find them with Spotlight, even if she can't see them in /Applications or ~/Applications ?Have you tried signing in to me.com?Even though I still think that's asking to be robbed, this is a very elegant solution indeed! ;)Let's leave complicated apps out of this for a sec (I only have one or two of them anyway). I don't see myself using two different `applications` folders (one for personal apps and one for shared apps). What's with that?I like to think on ultimate measures, almost utopian if you will... "modern [put your technology here]" to a hacker is almost like a bank with the most technological safe storing money to a robber. Can you really say nobody can break it? Well, in my mind, if I want information safeguarded the only way I know it will be is if nobody, and I mean nobody, knows about it. AES was not made by me, so someone knows about it.very interesting... but to play on the safe side, I'd rather have a simple solution to zero-out as a first step.@nathan yes, it just gives me the 'find my phone features'It is more that anyone can install into their own ~/Applications and not need admin rights. ALso ~/Applications tend only to be visible to yourself - standard Unix permissions. cf /usr/bin and ~/bin for command line scriptsCall it "security by obscurity" and that's juts the first step of what I'm suggesting. I'm not advocating it because I don't do it myself, I don't have anything in digital media that needs to be so safe guarded. I just like thinking about it. Keep in mind probability is just a statistical measure of historical facts. And you're only worried about encryption while there are many more aspects to consider. Talking about "security experts" and "it doesn't work" is way too vague, but I agree I'm also being vague, though that's because there's more to say than I can write. I'll edit my answer.there, if you're still interested. :)Notice that the new folder you create should probably use permissions that are appropriate. After you make the directory with this suggestion, you should probably also type 'chmod go= ~/.Trash' to ensure that only you have permissions to act on that folder (not "group" or "other" classes of users). In addition, you might need to restart the Finder for the Finder to *notice* that you've created a new .Trash folder (you can restart, logout-login, or use the Force Quit apple menu item to force the Finder to restart).Despite being a good question - this is speculation about a pre-announced software.This is the hard way you had to do it in apache1, apache2 supports automatic virtual hosts, so you can just drop a directory in, and it will be served. See [this](http://alen.mobi/blog/2009/09/16/snow-leopard-web-developer/) tutorialYes, but gives you more control. You can skip first part, but still need to do the second - `/etc/hosts`.If the app comes with an uninstall: Uninstall from /Applications and then install in ~/Applications.  (That is, if the installer is smart enough to allow installing there.)I can see how the tutorial you linked doesn't include `hosts` config. This is because it uses BIND DNS. If you do this though, you won't be able to use full domains as you want (http:// www.site1.dev). You'd have to use "local" domains (http:// site1.local).There's a lot of nice features... Shortcuts for seeking a custom number of seconds backward and forward. Restore playback position after closing. Open directly in full screen. Play over the desktop background. Slider for playback speed (no shortcuts though).Thanks. it is significantly faster.That looks like youre installed some PPC application, what installed a PPC quicklook plugin, or, your installed a 32 bit version plugin what the OS trying open as 64bit.[Cocktail](http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/index.php) has even more options, but is commercial. Then there's also [Secrets.prefpane](http://secrets.blacktree.com/).It also supports using fn as a modifier and snapping windows to screen edges and other elements.thats'OK, however I read somewhere that the BIND wasn't even necessary? You could set it up without adding lines to the host file ?So, the move is broken in textedit too? CTRL-A beginnig of line, CTRL-E end of line, CTRL-F one char right, CTRL-B one char left.Not that I know of. http:// localhost/ only works then, this would mean that you'd need to access your sites using http:// localhost/www.site1.dev/How about integrating this with AppleScript?hmm, works in textedit, must be my bash key bindings@Cawas: Maybe it is just a paradigm thing, it's not exactly the hardest thing to do, but still. I have to click the installer, I have to click and drag the file, I have to close the mounted file system window, I have to unmount the file system and I have to delete the installer. As opposed to clicking the installer, clicking "OK" to put it in the default place, then deleting the installer. 

Again, not a huge deal, just a lot of stuff in my face that I didn't think would need to be there.@Josh: Do you know why the connection was lost (physical unplug, etc). Also do you have a separate NIC for your iSCSI connection?So use, ESC-0 for the beginning of the line, "$" to end, and so on... :) but, you probably know "vi" when activated the vi-mode ;) (i'm using it too) :)Free MobileMe accounts, as you discovered, only give you access to find my iPhone. When icloud is officially rolled out this fall, you will get a free mail account, but until then you it is just a username, not an email address.Side Note: Wine is exactly how some games are ported to the Mac. Reference: The Sims 3 -- it installs the Windows version of the game with a custom Wine wrapper for running it on OS X.The game that i want to play (MW2) requires steam support, I bought the game and wanted to bootcamp my mac. But then i kinda sisliked the whole bootcamp idea. Should i just make a steam account and put the game there? As i start MW2 from a wrapper it says: "Steam should be running, in order for this game to be played."PS. I have the russian version of MW2.@DailyDoggy Steam is available for the Macintosh. I run the same account in Windows Boot Camp and MacOS.it's a bit complicated. I installed the english version of the game and am playnning to use it with the russian key code. will it work?I am familiar with Steam. i just don't like it very much nor do i play counter-strike or Civilisations. Our image of "Big games" is just different :)I have all Blizzard games and exe-packs (except WoW). Cod 4 2 :) Since i got better at cod4 iwanted to move up the ladder and play some MW2 :)When I simply name my sites directories `site1` and `site2` without activating virtualhosts, I can just access them like that. But then they are all on the same server. Which creates problems for serversite scripting.   When activate virtualhosts and create the virtualdocumentrootSince Lion is yet to be officially released and its license is therefore unknown, I don't think this question can be answered yet. The current developer release is linked to one Apple ID and can be installed on multiple computers, but whether the same will be true (legally) of the final version is yet to be seen. Vote to close.@jm666 - I have only those 2 plugins + a VMWare plugin (I have VMWare Fusion installed).  I have no folder in my HOME folder for QuickLook.  I have also downloaded and reinstalled the 10.6.7 update and the problem is still happeningI can still access them the same way, but then they are on their own server, correct? When I don't need to access my sites from another computer on my network, then a proper url setup with hostfiles doesn't offer me any advantage except a nice url?huh, that is an weird problem than. (btw, mean $HOME/Library/QuickLook, but you're sure checked it). Your LOG message indicate platform problems (64bit vs 32 bit or PPC) but you havent plugins... so - honestly, now havent any idea@ughoavgfhw the email address works, however, its only accessible on the phoneI've not tried to run steam + a game in WINE, mostly because I don't need to with bootcamp. As I say, its the simplest solution to the problem. I understand why it might not be a solution you like, but its still the simplest one.indeed - just overlooked that I would lose the emacs-style bindings :)what return this command? lipo -detailed_info /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickLook.framework/Resources/quicklookd.app/Contents/MacOS/quicklookd (see my answer too)You can try http://www.machangout.com/ (glims) too. Make subfolders in the Downloads based on date.Well, if you don't use VirtualHosts and only use folders `site1` and `site2`, you're still able to use all the things server-side scripting gives you, this includes .htaccess config. It's all matter of having correct paths, that's it.If you set up VirtualDocumentRoot and if you still use the same path, then nothing changes, and by accessing via folder (and not domain) it's still as if VirtualDocumentRoot wasn't set. As far as I'm concerned VirtualDocumentRoot setup (one you seem to after) won't properly work without BIND DNS or manually updating hosts file for each domain. Now, when it gets into accessing the site from other computers in the network, it's whole other story... Neither BIND DNS nor hosts file won't make any difference, as they apply only to your local machine's setup. Other computers are not affected.There may be NDAs but they are leaky.  Cocoasodt, for example, just pointed out that the next release of PathFinder -  NOT in the app store - works fine on Lion. I don't think its speculative at all to talk about that.WAAS and other enhanced GPS can get to millimeter accuracy over time for geologic and tectonic measurements. Less than 3 meters is commonplace for real time accuracy. http://www8.garmin.com/aboutGPS/waas.htmlIf this user installed an illegitimate iOS 5 beta (without a developer account), I have little sympathy.@jm666 - unfortunately I'm at work now so I can only provide feedback in about 9 hours time.So if I don't mind uncorrect paths, and the serverside applications I run are intelligent enough not to choke on that, I could just use folders. If I want nice automatic urls; I found a way for automatic host files using [bonjour](http://postpostmodern.com/instructional/a-smarter-mamp/#comment-1578).Hey, I hadn't noticed that. Nifty!The file somehow got corrupted in the update or just by chance. I would reinstall the os preserving all user and apps just in case something else isn't working. You could copy in that framework and re do the pre binding, but I would hate for something else to be broken too.ok, CU morning  /at my time :)/fixing [documentroot](http://jbenner.net/blog/quick-tip-get-proper-document-root-when-using-mod-vhost-alias) might be neededNope, it's a legit copy - I'll try download itunes 10.5I'm thinking that I'll do a clean install once Lion is released - that will definitely resolve the issue.  I'm going to try another suggestion from @jm666 and see how that goes.  If that fails I'll probably ensure my backup is up-to-date and do a clean install over the weekend in preparation for Lion in JulyIn the most basic sense, yes, but we just tested it and the refresh rate (even over my local network) isn't all the great. Since we're programming in real time while we're talking the delay causes problems. We'd like to be able to have a hardware-ish solution (or a software solution that gives us near real-time updates).This is my question too. Even using two step authentication, the iphone is already a trusted computer. The app could log into the google account and do a search for sensitive info and then send it back to the author.How do you know that you have these orphaned files?I would urge an install of snow leopard. The initial release of any OS has bugs - most of which are unintended consequences on systems with prior damage like yours...http://developer.apple.com/support/ios/purchase-and-next-steps.html#purchasecomplete has a nice timeline of what happens after you pay and before it is confirmed and active in the system.Not a guaranteed answer for the release, but it's very likely to be possible: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/07/how-to-burn-a-lion-boot-disc/This updated answer doesn't work all by itself, even after a reboot.is the question half-composed?Answers are getting upvotes but this  question gets downvote? Is this really such bad question that downvote is necessary? Strange...10.5 fixed it lol embarrassingNumbers is a whole spreadsheet, I do not need a cow to drink a glass of milk ;)Have I been somehow unclear ? I guess so. let me clarify a point : Tiger has not the `dscl` command, but `nicl`, which is its ancestor.I kinda except it would be too broad for your needs :) But you want something really specific and with Numbers you'll be able to manage many "goals" and more, since the app is very versatile. Anyway, worth a shot, maybe it'll help someone else. Hope you find the app you're looking for.but AFAIK have the NetInfo Manager... or no?Cool, i happy than you got a working system. ;) Good luck. :)IIRC the keynote said you could buy once via the store and use it on multiple macs. It didn't say you could download it on one mac and then use that download to upgrade multiple machines. I really hope you can though, I'm not that excited to download 4gb via wireless to my "set top box" mac mini when i already have a copy on my MBP via ethernet and several perfectly good memory sticks!@jm666 - I'll credit you with the answer.  Using the command you suggested lead me to try restoring the quicklookd application from my Time Machine backup.wow :). Thanx. As i told above, i'm happy than your system is working now. :) And i don't know when it is possible divide the bounty, but @bmike's suggetion (console.app - logfile) helped a lot... ;)thx!,better, but still not I am looking forMost retail disks are kept up to date overtime so far, espc. for new machine support during OS release cycles.Xee's fullscreen mode is much better than Previews.I don't know what's causing the connection to be lost, but since it happens with all protocols now, AFP, CIFS, NFS *and* iSCSI, it's a problem with the server. I think the data transfer is just overwhelming the virtual machine and it becomes unresponsive... but I'll ask another question, probably on the unix&linux stack exchange.Yes, I have, but I don't even have the slightest begin of understanding of how it works.Actually only two retail disc versions exist at this time: 10.6.0 (RTM) and 10.6.3. Apple has not released any further retail updates as new machine support is already covered by the version of Mac OS X already bundled with the machine. The most recent bundled version that I have come across is 10.6.6 on the Mac OS X USB stick bundled with the latest MacBook Airs.ok, later will delete my answer - i only want point you to one app, with witch is possible do most of OS X specific config things (users, groups, mounts, sharing) etc - but it is removed from the Leopard, so i can't "navigate" you, what to do...Here's a discussion to back this up further: http://www.mackb.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/mac/16622/using-a-Macbook-Pro-headless-with-the-lid-closedAlso see the rest of that thread re: the free 'wakeup' program which can WOL your sleeping machine (without needing help from another machine on your network).However, I believe that Cider is licensed to developers. Modifying it is unlikely to be legal. Also the previously mentioned games are pretty much as big as it gets (you could also add WoW and then you'd have almost all of them).+1 I use parallels quite a lot and there is a feature to isolate a network interface solely for the VM's use. Its a shame all software doesn't work this way.You can change keyboard shortcuts via Preferences window in Forklift. You can even select TotalCommander shortcuts if you're familiar with those. ForkLift2 is definitely the file manager of my choice.Agreed with Michal M: Forklift can do the full Orthodox keystrokes if that's what you like.PathFinder isn't generally considered to be an Orthodox File Manager, though as it is missing several defining features.  For one, it's missing the ability to copy files from one panel to another with the press of a single button.It's somewhat telling that you feel the need to beef up your list of "big games" with Myst, which is *18 years old*.deleted myst. ;)Nice answer, and welcome here. ;)What is an "Orthodox" file manager? I am not mocking, I just don't know what it is.This will only tell me the username and home of the user that runs the script. I want the user that is logged on to the GUI, the script is running as a different user.This is a good question, there should be a lock icons option in the settings page. I noticed in the Apple Store that their iPads have the icons locked so customers cant delete or move apps. So Apple have a way of doing it, but it might be custom firmware.See [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_file_manager#Orthodox_file_managers).The user does not appear in `/etc/passwd/`. I updated the question.@Josh: If you run a long running ping test, do you lose any packets?Correction: It's not a solution you like. iTunes doesn't support FLAC, plain and simple. Short of converting your FLAC files to another format with an offering like xAct (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xact/), there isn't much else in the way of options.It wouldn't. That was the point.Cool. Good find!I didn't know what the actual versions they had in stock were, but usually they keep retail versions on the shelves that will work in all currently shipping hardware, or at least they used to.Are you positive that your IPv6 settings are correct? Why not post a screenshot of your IPv6 settings screen?I definitely like Skitch's features (though it's workflow/usability is... frustrating, at least to me). Being able to make distinctly vivid arrows/lines, boxes, circles, or text within seconds is a great feature of Skitch. Emphasis on DISTINCTLY VIVID. Any neon (pastel?) color in a hurry, with distinct sizes and completely readable.The tunnel works fine.  I've since found that my iPad connected via Wifi _has_ automatically got an IPv6 address from my LAN, but my wife's iPhone 4 won't.Thanks, I missed the hardware reqs there, thanks. But no memory footprint, either RAM or Disk.  It also says "To update on day one". But will a disk ship on day 30? Apple usually allows two major revs back to update.There's been no mention of disk-based updates at this point.  As for RAM, I assume Apple feels that any Mac that shipped with a Core 2 Duo would have shipped with enough memory to meet the OS's minimum. I agree that disk footprint, at least for the installation, would be helpful.According to what I see on the betas, you will want to have 4GB for the image to download and another 10GB for the upgrade. I don't have proof or official info about this, but so far that's been my little experience on an old White Macbook.@Rich there's not going to be a DVD ship as far as I've seen. You will, however, be able to save the download (so far it's possible, don't know when final is released). There will be a hidden partition created by the installer where it will put all the OS ready to -reinstall + restore from TimeMachine-. If your harddrive fails, you will presumably have to re-download the image after you have SnowLeopard. I haven't seen (yet) any utility to create the DVD from the downloaded stuff (that would be a decent idea).I've been experimenting and i've found that inside the downloaded package for the installer (show package contents) there's a  Contents/SharedSupport folder that has a InstallESD.dmg, if you burn that to a DVD it's an independent installer. I don't know if this will be officially supported or if it will work with the final version.The details of how the beta is being distributed is no guarantee how the final download will happen. Currently, no MAS product allows the installer to be visible to the end user so something would have to change for this to be possible.Good old `dscl` ... don't know why I didn't think of that!That is cleaner than userHome=$(dscl . -read /Users/`logname` NFSHomeDirectory | awk '{print $2}) ; user=$(basename $userHome) - nicely doneRelated: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x@jm666 - thanks for the nod. I would have fallen down surprised if lipo showed the binary was somehow still runnable - one would have to go to great lengths to strip the header and when the binary won't run, lipo generally has nothing to report. Cheers to you and also glad @Anthony has a fix and a plan.COOL. +1 for this app. Thanx.Already installed Afloat. It is really cool. ctrl-cmd-scroll ---> transparency change is fantastic. :)Additional (hossibly useful) info: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/08/how-to-install-lion-from-an-sd-card/That is really cool. Thanks so much for adding this. Do you mind if I add your info to my answer above once I have a chance to see if it works for me? +2 to @pstOh yes. That is *exactly* what I want. Thanks!PathFinder has many nice features, but really bad keyboard shortcuts, e.g. TAB key is not working.Please use the `edit` link to clean up this question a bit and make it a little clearer exactly what your question is.@Lri: Finder does not understand the obvious `set the clipboard to {one,two}` (though another AppleScript program can successfully extract the list). The *StandardAdditions* clipboard commands may be limited to single items.Shame you have to go through developer tools to do this noise.This is all standard comments for any beta - assume any beta will corrupt anything it canLooks good but is broken in 5.0Duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-xSorry guys. I tried to provide as much info as i could but it just ended up a jumbled mess.  My question is pretty straightforward.I suspect that the Web hosting part of MobileMe will be killed once iCloud arrives and MobileMe is shut down. There's ample precedent for Apple to kill services they think no longer make sense: think iCards. There's been no mention of the fate of iDisk, either, and Steve specifically made fun of the idea of "a hard drive in the sky." For us longtime Apple watchers, when Steve mocks something, it's going to go away sooner or later.Nice catch! :-)Can you please elaborate a bit why PF method is better?It hangs when the photo library is stored on remote nas.Thanks, I flagged and asked to move it.You may contact the [developer directly](http://www.pixelsyncapp.com/contact) then..**Definitely** do a back-up before you do the deed as @Kerri suggests.@neoneye you can't even configure it, the keyboard shortcuts editor does not work.there is no X icon for paused download.I think it goes away when you reboot the iPhonePlease read the [FAQ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq). Shopping or buying recommendation questions are not allowed.How did you set it up?Here's an article on Lion's new Terminal. http://osxdaily.com/2011/05/23/terminal-in-mac-os-x-lion-gets-full-screen-mode-eye-candy/It might seem quicker if the apps ae closed but the time ti measure is from wake up until you have all your apps started with documents in - is that quicker to wake up and then manually restart everything?Push alert for every new tweet?@tegbains no packet loss. But the massive amount of I/O was causing the backup server to be unresponsive. I believe I found a solution!Thanks for the answer. Yes, I am well aware of the capacity dependence on format and bit rate. My question was actually intended for HD video I record with the built-in camera. I will update the question to make it clearer.Ahh, understand. That has advantage too. Imagine: in PF the default state is "deny everything". So, you're secure. And you with the next rules step-by-step allowing passing some packets. In contrast in IPFW, the default state is open and the "deny everything is usually the last rule". It is ok too, but it is easier make a mistake and a bit harder to configure.care the down-voter comment the down-vote?The question was about moving or resizing windows, not zooming the screen.Hey @Neil, how did you go on your mouse hunt?@Jason you must have loved those blue screens of eternal death.@jm666 you're right, it does still power the RAM. But AFAIK the RAM is indeed saved to HD.Even with your update, it depends. Obviously the 32GB is going to be roughly 4 times as long. Updating answer with more info.Duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4944/are-there-any-free-alternatives-to-finderSee also: Also: http://superuser.com/questions/29268/alternative-file-managers-on-mac-os-xThanks, David. I hope the iPod's glass is the same as the iPhone. Also, it is not me, but my wife who's gonna use it, and knowing her - it will be "stored" in a crammed handbag - which is my concern. Heck, she was able to render a used iPod that I got her last year dead in two months of use... that is a device that worked nicely for a couple of years before she received it...Per your flag, admins do not have the ability to accept answers on the behalf of users that appear to have abandoned a question. Sorry.@jm666 true when you say it doesn't *read* the RAM from the HD after a normal wake up, but I think it *writes* it to HD as a backup when sleeping. My HD is very silent, but I do hear it working harder after I close the lid.Thanks again. So, the combined information from the two links suggests somewhere between 4.5 and 6 hrs (give or take some) for the 32GB model, and around 1.5 hrs for the 8GB. It also suggest that for photo storage, around 11,500 and 3000 photos.I'd be worried about an AT&T store employee keeping it or rooting around in it themselves. Probably be more trusting of an Apple store.maybe could you emphasize, in regards to your main objective, why the apps you tried didn't satisy you. I think Vox rely on a manually managed playlist, and doesn't sort by album/artist, so what is missing in it ?I see. I misunderstood the question.@kraymer I haven't found a way to do that with Vox. I can't find any playlist with that App. Being able to add folders and place whatever I want (MP3s) in them is my main need. What most apps do is to (if folders exist) organize them according to their tags, I just don't wan't that and also can't rely on tagging.It does the same as any other, if you drop many folders there, it ignores the folders and "spits" out the MP3 organized by tags, and as I said I can't (and don't want to) rely on tags. Both Audion and SoundJam could do this *so simple* task, drag a folder from the finder and the folder is kept, you could move it, drag/delete files.@jm666 : @jackJoe is correct, since the October 2005 revision of the PowerBook G4, Mac portables have used Safe Sleep, writing RAM to the HD when going to Sleep. This is why Mac OS X does not have a "hibernate" option. This is only a backup, and not used normally. You see the bar when the battery is depleted because RAM is being refreshed from the hard drive. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1757?viewlocale=en_USThis only worked on or before June 5 and was turned off June 6, 2011 as part of the transition to iCloud.These accounts could be marked as developer sandbox only similar to Game Center accounts that were all mass deleted just before the go-live date for the general public. Use caution unless you have information that these are not just test accounts and will actually be migrated if that matters to you.You also have unrarx http://www.unrarx.com/ but only for decompression, I would also like to know of an app to compress as .rar, which your post doesn't say...To clarify, since the October 2004 rev. of Powerbook G4, Mac portables have used Safe Sleep, and **always** backup the contents of RAM to the Hard Drive when going to sleep, in case the battery is drained while asleep.Most people don't have issues and never need these tools. Good luck and I hope the underlying problem gets resolved. Automating the reset process is a poor workaround for something that should just work. I can imagine your frustration at having to do this even once a month.I find it best to disconnect from the network (which is doable by taking down the active interfaces or modifying the routing tables) and then letting the sync time out. You can then disable it. This might be of use to people that don't want to killall in terminal.Apparently the iPod Touch does NOT have gorilla glass, so it's not quite as touch as the iPhone. Perhaps a sleeve cover to put it in when it's in that handbag?Apple has made it very clear that June 30, 2012 is the last day MobileMe will work. It's in the two sentence summary at the top of http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4597 - given that, I would be highly surprised if web forwarding didn't work up until the end. I agree with your sentiments - just we don't have to guess on the end date for MobileMe as we currently know it.If you add a comment or edit the question to provide the approximate percentages of ram that is free and is inactive when you sleep the mac - I can be more specific in my answer. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1342Excellent find!@jm666 You miss the point: The Mac **always** goes to Safe Sleep. http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/10328.htmlWell, to be clear, by default on portables Safe Sleep is enabled, on desktop, it isn't. Type `pmset -g | grep hibernatemode` into the terminal. 0: ram powered on when sleeping, wake up fast, safe sleep disabled. 1: hibernation. system shut down, ram dumped, wake up slow. 3: ram powered, wake up fast, safe sleep enabled so RAM is dumped to disk. Use `sudo pmset -a hibernatemode X` to set mode.@bmike: Per your flag, developer questions are okay up to the point of asking about actual code. The lingering question is really how much traction these will get over time (which so far isn't much, but there really isn't another place to ask them. SO will close stuff like this and Programers is for subjective questions).What returned your "pmset -g"? only wondering. Pls copy & paste. :) (because mine " hibernatemode 0")But yes, jackJoe was correct and my MBP is somewhat strange. With the hibernatemode 0011 (3) macs save the memory into hdd when going to sleep.If I was you I'd try replacing the RAM first.I don't have RAM to try with.http://developer.apple.com has discussions for anything relating to beta software and NDA material and iCloud beta - perhaps you meant no other place on SE.I'll try thanks you! hmm, what is "Option" key?I just tried SimplyRar with OS X 10.5.8 and it works great!@Daniel The "option" key says "option" on Apple keyboards and "Alt" on other keyboards.Thanks for the answer, but which log files should I check?Kelly - welcome to the site. Could you edit your question or answer here in the comments where specifically you want the phone numbers saved? Also - back up is confusing as for the contacts to go to gmail or outlook - that is usually seen as a sync and not simply a backup. Changes you make in outlook should sync to the phone and vice/versa. A backup is one way...'you might want to try to first narrow down whether it's hardware, system software or user software.' Do you think there's really a chance it could be just a software problem and not an hardware one?can be. For example buggy kernel extension (driver) can cause froze.This is not a duplicate, because this is specifically about orthodox file managers. Dual pane and classic OFM shortcuts.Sadly I don't think it's in warranty any more. Will try to find another computer to test it with.Can you give some more detail about the problem you're having?Please use caution - back up is not the same as a sync. If you delete your contacts and then restore - you might just as will end up with duplicates when google merges them down from the google servers. Have you made sure your sync is set up correctly with your PC/Mac through iTunes - the article here can help http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1386 - once you have a good copy on your computer, it's easier to delete and trust the computer can get those contacts to google if needed.Can you post the log entry for one of the ssh attempts?But how should I move the iPhoto Library to the network device (NAS)? If I try to copy the library, it says that im not allowed to...Why guess when in three minutes time you can know? Most issues of freezes are software - but even an experienced tech can be wrong based on "best guess" When hardware fails, it often gets much worse very rapidly and the mac won't boot at all.What part of the hardware test was running when it "froze"? Are you running built in diagnostics (by booting with the D key held) or some other test? Lastly, what model is your mac? (paste your serial number after http://support.apple.com/specs/ with no space after the / to get the exact model)Do you mean copy the file or copy the contents of the file so that the contents can be pasted?That'd be a pain; I have other services that use this. I'll have to experiment to see if that's the case.I don't get "Show Package Contents" in the right-click menu.I do not trust the binary, either. I want to never ever give it administrative permissions (which it should not need anyway).That did not work unfortunately. It still insisted to "Installing at base path /" and then asked for the admin password.+1. With this I could quickly verify that there is just the application binary in there, no other system-wide stuff.Or if the mac is sleeping at 3:15 AM Saturday morning, when it wakes.It's the answer to why - as you note, you could do it temporarily for testing to make sure it's the case. Then you can look into http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~greg/sshdfilter/ to cut off hosts that try to brute force your mac.Does the answer to this question change now that a Mac/PC is just a device with the new iCloud way of things?Thanks for the clear and extensive answer!Hi, the failure rate of SSD greater than traditional drives, as shared by Jeff Atwood (who passes here occasionally) said: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html   So, go for SSD for speed rather than reliability.  But, the speed is such an advantage that it justifies a more rigorous backup regime.only wondering why you want opening Windows Notepad for the text files..."Free me.com accounts for all." with "all" meaning every one who owns an iGadget or a mac with OSX 10.7 (or later).Are you saying that when you press the home button you can feel the edges of the surrounding glass?  If so I think that is probably normal.  It should be flush with the glass when NOT pressed though.  Or am I misunderstanding?-1 because TotalFinder doesn't have the requested SCP and FTP support.+1 for ForkLift -- an excellent application that's not nearly as well known as it ought to be.This doesn't work. It just displays all files.Hey, thanks for trying anyway Calum. I appreciate it.The stroke - I modified the question based on your input@Peter - Thanks for your detailed replies!  Is it possible to run pf on Mac OS X 10.6.7 ?Can you clarify some of your constraints:
1) If you're not using wireless, how are you connecting the iPads to the network? Are they allowed to be wireless, just not the IP cameras?
2) Are you trying to setup a front end to the IP cameras to control # of people who connect to them?We are installing cameras in the cabin on an aircraft and need to view it on the iPads on the flight deck. But certification rules will not allow us to use WiFi for this.We will have a couple of thousand iPads so I understand we can use the Enterprice opportunity Apple gives and that gives us grater possibilities with regards to the app calling private API:s. Am I right?But how to connect the iPad to the network via the cable? Do you have an app that handles that? We can't use WiFi.The iPad doesn't have any ethernet cable and only uses Wi-Fi or 3G network.The notification manager is getting a total overhaul for iOS 5 - so head to http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#notification and click on the "lock screen" to see what is planned. It will be built in so no need for forwarding, a separate account, etc...@Scott -- it was JM who answered your question, not me :)@the-communist-duck : you should accept this answer then...Well, I sometimes get flashing amber with the Apple-supplied batteries.  If so, I take them out and carefully reinsert them, then charging begins.  So perhaps make no conclusion about other batteries based on a single try.@Rabskatran Whoops, I thought I had accepted it.Actually - this does work for me. I tested several folders with more than 2000 photos, and each time it picked out the 20 or 200 ( or zero) files that were new that backup. I still like http://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/ but this seems to answer the question as to what's new in a backup with a clever and speedy find command.Cub71 - As an enterprise user you can make whatever apps you want, sign them and they run. You don't need approval to use private API because you don't enter them into the public App Store - just knowledge and a little money for the yearly certificates.Thanks for the extensive answer. The problem is that I use some other tools for the deployment and these tools are not able to `chown`. Do you know any workaround that will not risk me to break the web server due to file permissions?You are correct, a long time coming though.You should be able to make the user you use be in a group appropriate for the existing files - what directories do you deploy to? `_www` has no problems reading files owned by root (or any other user) it's more a `umask`/`chmod` issue than ownership.@Scott - I don't know the answer to this question. The kernel part of `pf` is in the kernel long time ago. Cna check source code e.g. here: http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1504.9.26/bsd/net/ . Why Apple still not released userland commands (like `pfctl`) and why it is not enabled by default - is unclear. So, maybe sometimes yes, but i don't know any running pf - yet.And though it might or might not make sense in your situation, @Sorin, it's worth noting that next month the OS X Lion upgrade will be $29 and upgrading *that* to OS X Lion Server is just another $50.Sounds like he still wants the lid up though?Because it's special notepad and I must it :/Yet another way to see the contents of the plist: `defaults read /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-weekly`If you have Xcode 3 it includes a Bluetooth explorer. It will help rule out new interference on bluetooth channels. Adding a wireless phone, microwave oven, or other device that transmits can cause interference.Given the news on Lion - I would avoid moving to server at this point unless you know you can't risk that and need ftp now at the cost of money or time to find another ftpd...You are always going to be the slowest thing on a computer - so pick the layout that saves you time thinking about where things are and more likely to get to work by removing distractions.What level of OS are you running? The ps -u does not work for me on 10.6.7 - ps -U works so either your OS is different or your path has an alternate ps binary or I'm missing something else obvious.  (FYI MD5 (/bin/ps) = 32a504d1010b2e40beebe8c30ff7bf6d )I suppose if the set-user-ID-on-execution bit on /bin/ps (or whatever ps is in the path first) were gone this makes great sense... `$ ls -la /bin/ps

Another question: Do I understand it right, that the content of `/etc/conf` (assuming it exists) can be modifyed by Workbench?Yes to _example files_ and Yes - I believe so. I don't have any of the files loaded on my mac to inspect - but as long as the user running the Workbench can create the file (or edit it once it's in place) Mac OS X won't prevent you from editing the file in /etc (which really is a link to /private/etc) As far as Mac - there is nothing special about MySql or the workbench so you might need to ask in the power users forum if no-one here has specific knowledge of that mysql tool.Well, unfortunately it appears that MakeItMine no longer works since it apparently relied on SBFakeCarrier as well. I went ahead and tried Fake Operator and that worked pretty well. Haven't tried un-jailbreaking yet to see if the setting holds, but maybe I'll just keep it this way after all :)I will ask in the power user forum for this explicit detail. And thanks for your answer(s) so far.I've actually bought it just now, but it looks as if it does not download the images either. Just the feeds themselves. But yes, it looks awesome. edit: Actually it stores already fetched images until you switch to another feed, then deletes them, which is pretty useless.Preferences -> Syncing tab -> Make sure 'Download read items' is checked. I believe that'll save your images after you've switched feeds.Also, consider submitting this feedback to the dev. He's a good guy and has been known to turn around features fast if you ask nicely.This is off-topic on this site. While tablet devices like the iPad might be the future, they're *clearly* not computers! *cough*Hmm, the rotation happens the wrong way too. Imagine you have your physical monitor placed on its side instead of its base. Even if you turn your iPad, the output is still oriented to look right if you have your monitor on its base..It is checked (it was by default). Also I've actually just written a mail to the support address. It's a nice reader nevertheless and if I have to live with this little pet peeve, I'm fine with that. Would be a really useful feature for me though.I'm not following. The monitor that we use supports different orientations. If I put the monitor vertically (Portrait), then the iPad display fills the entire screen when I hold it in Portrait. if I hold the iPad in Landscape, then I get a letterbox effect on the monitor. If I put the monitor in Landscape, then I get a similar effect.For whatever it is worth, it works the same on our higher end projectors as well. However, I have noticed that the video behavior is different from iPad2 and iPad. I am using an iPad2, so this may not be relevant.I just ordered the Fliders, thanks!If you always keep your battery topped off, then it's almost as bad as long term storage when full. That decreases the capacity between 6 and 35% annually based on temperature (these numbers are for 0 C to 40C). Discharge cycles also wear down a battery - so it's safe in the short term, but not ideal in the long term. They are replaceable so if you prefer to have shorter life by always topping off - you can pay sooner for a replacement.Great, this is what I was looking for, thanks+1 For this great piece of software!Bluetooth mouse/keyboard can wake too.Hmm, (2) is what's not happening for me. There seems to be no way to set the monitor up in Portait mode. I mean, I can tilt it physically, but the video is still wrong. I guess it's a monitor setting I should be looking for then. Let me get back to you.Deployment software, that is unable to `chown`? Really? I think you need to find some better software, personally.Thank you so much!@GEdgar: I also get the flashing amber sometimes with the Apple supplied batteries, so I did remove and reinsert to make sure that it wasn't a fluke.read the question. The batteries that he used were **brand new**.@RobZolkos I was having the same problems as OP. Your advice that the app-specific password expires quickly after generation seems to have fixed my issues. It worked best for me when I was already in Mail Settings, ready to enter the code and had another browser open (i.e. on another machine) in which to generate the password.Well, I'm trying to work with XML in Python. StackOVerflow was more appropriate than a Mac poweruser forum.Thanks. That was close. What finally did it was this: sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxmlnoobproof link is broken"Sometimes I try to connecte to a Wifi network..." Can you elaborate. Is it always the same network having issues. Do you connect successfully one time and another time it doesn't work? Is this a public network or work/school network?It looks great and I'd love to use it but the $9.99 price tag puts me off. /cheapskateYeah, I get that. It's worth it thought after having tested it myself. It's pretty similar to NetNewsWire Lite thought (which is free, but without Google Reader Sync). Also I'm marking this as the answer now. It's not the solution I was looking for, but good enough for now.It should work. Unless Apple makes changes to their Boot Camp softwareOnly wondering why you didn't use Parallels or so. In practice, i never saw any performance penalty in normal use. (office and similiar)Thanks, it worked like a charm.thanks for this answer ^__^ but it's pretty hard.. maybe you have something more easy?yes. Install Parallels and the the launcher/wrapper will be created auto-magically... ;)I stuck here: --edit wineLocation if your wine install is not the default location<br />
        set wineLocation to "/usr/local/bin" What the means "wine install"? its at Applications, no? ohh ye and more question: can i get your skype/messenger? :)i'm not an wine user, so don't know what wine you got and where it is installed. Maybe some real wine user will give a better advice. ;)wife can't be user **B** :) /kidding/ ;)About Parallels: IF i want it, I need to download all window system and my computer will be more slower, thats right?you will need windows - yes. Windows will take some place on your HDD. When you will run parallels will consume memory a processor time. The overhead is approx. 5% (or less), in usual applications - so your windows app will run 5% slower as native.I'll take a stab at explaining / answering but the iPhone doesn't have any advanced DHCP debugging and apps that do that on the App store generally get pulled due to violations of what API they can call.  To really troubleshoot this you need with a second device or a computer or access to the router.Now.. I need windows 7 :P you know where I can download?Hahha!!!!!!! :)Not a real answer, but try restart both mac's. It is in 99% cases not needed, but now the mac probably remember some old mount-points (shared dirs) when you trying sharing somewhat before. But i'm can be fully wrong...styfle, maybe on 1/4 of routers I can connect successfully by restarting the router or my phone, the rest of them don't work, and yes these are normally public networks.Folks, Owen's answer above totally works. I had a whopping 9 GB "other" on my iPhone, and it had nothing to do with a jailbroken phone or saved content. As Owen suggested, cleaning out the music folders did the trick.bmike: if I have another device (say a laptop) are there any tools I can use to debug the connection?@XQYZ - I am tempted, there's no question... It looks the goods and I'm a heavy Google Reader user... hmmm...Indeed - on a mac the airport is usually listed as device en1 - so I would start with `sudo tcpdump -i en1` and you will see all the traffic the laptop is seeing on that network. It will be busy - so just watch and get a feel. When the iPhone joins - you'll see ARP requests and perhaps see the volume on the network. It may be overload / not helpful - but it's free and you will have the laptop to see how it gets info from the same DHCP server...+1 for Wireshark - it's still an X11 app, but easy mac download and install (plus simple uninstall instructions) make it much simpler to get going than my Zenmap suggestion.just edited my question with the system.log after a freeze. Any advice will be appreciated.There really are no restrictions on MAS build tools or embedding interpreters like the iOS store. The main rule seems to be it must be better than the alternatives already on the store from a UI polish and not require admin privileges to run. Good luck getting your ruby/alternative app in the MAS!Also - the software for windows and mac linked from this post may be very helpful in debugging the DHCP issues.  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15784/tcp-test-tool-for-mac-os-xYou local administrator (the account you created at setup) shouldn't have rights over the LDAP domain, so that part's normal.  But you should be able to use diradmin.  The delay sounds to me like a DNS issue -- try un `host $HOSTNAME` to see if your server's name is mapped to its IP address in DNS.  Also, run `sudo changeip -checkhostname` to check the reverse mapping (but if it reports a mismatch, you probably shouldn't trust its advice about fixing it).ok, so ruby is possible. Great to hear. Are there other cool ruby apps out there?Oops. Totally missed that. I'll leave the answer, anyway, just in case someone is searching and that is their problem.Good advice, thanks!What kind of feature are you missing in iMovie?If your HW test froze, here will be probably "some" HW error. The error messages above suggest only some network errors, for example: "dns errors" or some network misconfig. IMHO nothing what can cause a "froze". Any advice here will be only guessing and trying.fixed the broken link.It hasn't been put in /Applications. In fact, I've taken another look at the App Store and it's asking me if I want to install The Unarchiver. I assume this means it isn't installed already (from the App Store). I'll try nuking my current installation of The Unarchiver and I'll get back to you.So, you want make an application what when is executed will copy an folder (with name = $USER) from the **known network path** (what is already mounted - e.g. the path is exists in the "/Volumes/something" to the ~/Desktop. right?I nuked the current install and tried again. Now The Unarchiver is sitting in /Applications. Thanks for your help Ian.Makes sense. Thanks.There is a Fn key on the MacBook Pro - it's in the lower-left-hand corner. All MacBook Pros have it.Cocoa apps and other apps that use standard system text fields should accept the Ctrl-D shortcut.Recently I found a game in my shelf and the desire to play it grew in my stomach. Sadly it is a Windows-Only-Game. And because I have only a MacBook I thought of installing Windows 7 to satisfy my desire. :-)you can test the Parallels - demo download. Parallels emulating DirectX nicely, so it is possible play games too. You can try it for performance - and you will be surprised. ;) Anyway, Parallels can use the BootCamp windows - so you can give a try: 12GB for minimum (Windows7 + office + basic work place) and add space needed for other sw.Super User is not for questions about mobile devices as per the [FAQ](http://superuser.com/faq).Flag it for mod attention, and a mod will see it and move it for you.Parallels sounds interesting. But since it is not free, I think I'll go for BootCamp first. Thank you!so by `stops charging` do you mean to say its fine to leave it plugged in as long as we like? (i was thinking as long as its connected, even if its not charging, there is still a transfer of electricity or smt)you can also hold down `c` to boot from the discI looked on ifixit, even for my specific Mac, and the screws aren't included in the bundle, nor did I see them individually available :(http://www.ifixit.com/MacBook-Parts/MacBook-Pro-15-Inch-Unibody-Mid-2009-Mid-2010-Early-2011-Hard-Drive-Bracket/IF161-036?utm_source=ifixit_cart&utm_medium=cart_product_link&utm_content=product_listDo you know what tech specs are for the RAM or where I can look that up?  My 2nd question wasn't how many RAM slots there are, I know there are 2, it's whether the included 4gbytes was 2x2gbytes or 1x4gbytes.Also note you can use Spotlight to open applications. Press CMD+Space and type the name "Xcode" and it should be the first hit under the Applications heading.I can confirm that QuickTime X can play AMR files.

And also, browsing the comments the author mentions that you can't differentiate between the different command keys (in ukelele).the included ones are always two ram sticks in two slots. Using only one slot would not be beneficial for speed reasons.So, my answer was not helpful. I know no other way, sry.hmmm... aren't developers under the NDA which forbids them from releasing _this_ sort of information?Screenshot removed, but similar info is on the iCloud page on apple.com.There was only one file with that name. It turns out there were just duplicate entries in the File Sharing list for some reason.There were old entries in the File Sharing list; not sure why they weren't cleaned out. Seems to be fixed now, thanks.You're thinking of "trickle charging", which is pulling just enough energy to keep the battery topped off as well as run the phone's functions so it's not using the battery. That's perfectly okay; my iPhones have charged like that for years and are fine.I have exactly the same issue with exactly the same symptoms. Resetting the SMC & PRAM made no difference. What is interesting is than an XP CD boots into setup just fine, it's only Windows 7 boot DVDs, one of which I used a year ago to install windows 7 on the same machine with no issues whatsoever that fails.@mindless Once the computer wakes, you can open the lid back up and the display is still offI have a pre-unibody MBP 15''Thats it.

What key do you have there instead?What keyboard is physically installed? The function key is lowest and leftmost on the US keyboard. It might be moved on some international keyboards.+10 for the awesome pictures. It must be an international keyboard or have had the keycaps replaced for Fn to be missing.Thanks XQYZ. If you leave an answer I'll give you credit.@bmike Yeah, it must be missing on some international keyboards; I looked at balexandre's profile and from that checked the Danish and Portuguese MacBook Pro keyboards and they both had Fn keys, so it must be some other version.Thanks for reply... i went to iStore... and saw some white iphone4 devices... yeah issue is same... there is some edges round the corners in iphone4... but in ipods there are no as such... and 1 more reason.. that i have screen guard over my screen thats why i feel slightly more... Apple Store guys told me your iphone is pretty normal and fine.. i think i not need to worry about that ;)Aha, great answer. thanks very much.  Funny, I had heard about printopia in my various surfing for answers, but I hadn't gotten the message that it was indeed the one that worked well, as opposed to sketchily.  I realized that one reason it was lower-profile in my research is because of its existence as something that runs on your mac, not as an app on the ipad (therefore I couldn't see reviews/stars on the ipad app store)  and furthermore, it's not for sale on the MAC app store so no reviews or stars there.  but, I have the info now. Thanks!I assume you mean printopia as the $20 app you are mentioning, which will make airprint work for me?  That's the point that was made by an answerer below and both of you are totally right.  thx!I don't have an AppleTV so I'm taking a stab in the dark. What bracketing type of characters does the AppleTV have? Would the angle bracket characters not be under the parenthesis `( )`'s, or right angle brackets `[ ]`'s?

I would expect that there wouldn't be curly brackets `{ }`'s built in, but they might be in the same location.thanks, mindless.

Ie include a size? -ctime +30 AND -size +10000000cI was wondering this myself, it doesn't make sense why you can call any account except your own when you have multiple devices attached to that account.There's a *significant* difference between `ctime` and `mtime` and in most cases people mean to use `mtime` (the time the contents of the file last changed) and not `ctime` (the time the inode-related information for the file changed). Very rare to see `ctime` used this way, so I mention this as a caution to you OP.That post is simply a consumer review - question/answer.

In my experience, any group with more than three people will have someone who refuses to use Google Docs, making it useless.QuickLook can also be very confusing for inexperienced users (even experienced users): if you click off the file the QuickLook window stays open but now displays the contents of whatever you clicked on. If the Finder isn't the frontmost app then the QuickLook window vanishes, only to surprisingly reappear when you switch back to the Finder. This latter behavior is particularly annoying if you want to, say, look at the document on one side of your monitor and at an email or web page or whatever on the other side: if the Finder isn't frontmost you can't see both. Frankly, it's surprisingly bad.But they don't break =D  Ok, they do break, but I think that you actually have to use one almost full time to be able to help with it when it does break.@mindless Go into System Preferences -> Displays and click "Detect Displays"Not really -- Goog^H^H^H^HBing is my friend.

Too bad it doesn't do keyboard, though. Surely there would be keyboard focus issues with the VNC app in the background, but it could work, I suppose, to some degree.When you did the restore from backup, was the app already in "waiting" mode, or did you have to go to the App Store to initiate the download? Second, what version of iOS are you on? 4.3.3?I don't see that as a very significant factor. AppleCare covers 3 years for all the computers (and Apple Displays) and 2 years for the consumer products (iGadgets, AppleTV).Do you get any error messages in the log files?-1 for not answering the question.I'm a programmer/designer for my job, and I run specific software that doesn't have anything even remotely close that runs on tablets, I would imagine that other people might have similar issues.thanks, when i buy my new one I guess it will already be prepared.I am using latest 4.3.3 only.

Submerge and iSubtitle respectively add hard and soft-coded subtitles to a video file; but in either case they only work if I *already* have the subtitles file. Which I dont. I want an app that helps me create the subtitles file.Thanks for the recommendation. I tried, and it sort of works. But not quite. First it always crashed on start, then I managed to get it to start by disabling automatic updates. Now it works, but the interface is very strange and confusing. Anyway, probably I need to play a bit more with it. +1 for coming up with a suggestion, though.It doesn't seem to work well on my system (Snow Leopard, if it matters).

Wow! Apple didn't mess about there!I got the demo, this is good! It is precisely what I need but, indeed, the price is just crazy! I won't pay all that money just to subtitle one video for personal use! +1 for the effort.You can try to borrow the DVD from someone who owns a Mac.What exactly is your usage case scenario?If you don't have headphones plugged in, then plugging them will change volume back to default "half of the bars" :-(sounds like very reasonable observations.two **hundred** and freaking thirty euros?!

But it sure is related.This answer should come with an actual time machine.@maclema: The thing is, my computer _does_ remember its "basic" volume setting, but not the one for headphones (not across reboots, at least). Do you think that's also managed by PRAM? In other words, does your Mac behave differently? I thought it was a "by design" thing, and asked here looking for some workaround.By the way, whenever I plug in headphones **before** booting my Mac, the issue does not apply and I get the same "decent" volume I set the time before.k, editing the main post with a urlThat "hope you sprung" was from the article. I'm perfectly happy with my 14 GB iPhone 4.Unfortunately cmd+click doesn't work. Also: Radium is started manually, so well after every other menu bar occupying application has started up. Either OS X or the app seems to remember the menu bar icon's location and place it in the middle every time.The reason I think it is a duplicate is the update to the question.Agreed. AppCleaner works well for me.I guess that is the price if they expect to sell to professionals, not to hobbyists.I have had issues when the preference that stores the ordering is malformed. Have you tried moving `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist` to the desktop or the trash and logging out/in again to reset the ordering?Sorry, but I'm asking for a way to disable the "locked" state altogether. I think it's pretty clear from the wording of my question. :)Do you have any software requirements on your computer OS or command line tools? In a nutshell, iTunes on the iPod wants the file to be listed in the library as well as stored in the correct location - so tools like PhoneView might be scriptable if you are more interested in command line than just getting the songs over and bypassing iTunes.Third here. Just make sure to go to Preferences and activate "Smart Delete". Every time you then trash an app it auto-launches AppCleaner, which is awesome.This is not necessarily a good way because applications leave things around (eg in ~/Library/Application Support) which then justwaste space on your hard drive. Since it's difficult to find and delete them all manually, it's easier to use an application for it.no luck. Still shows up in the same spot on my menu bar. I talked to the dev and he said it's impossible for apps to allow menu bar icons to be moved but he thought starting it last should place the icon last. Oh well.Technically they can't, as Lion is under the standard preview NDA.I can't mark this as "Community Wiki" although I believe it should be one.Although Subs Factory has a very ugly interface, it does seem to be functional and I was able to quickly add a couple of subtitles to my video. My biggest problem with this app is that (for some bizarre reason) neither the meter nor the subtitle display work; so the only way to see if the subtitles appear at the appropriate moment is to save the subtitles file and then load both the video and subtitles in something like VLC. Not very good for a long-ish project!as i told above - never tried the app, so sorry for the wrong suggestion. I think, the hardest thing on subtitling is the right timing. Editing the .srt .sub or like files is easy and can be done in any tex-editor, so if you can manage timing in the App, you can edit the text in the TextEdit.app. What type do you use? .srt? .sub?@GEdgar, c'mon, a brand new FinalCut Express is U$200 - which means it's cheaper to create the whole video than to add subtitles to it?! Still sounds like pushing too hard on the price.@Juan it is an ugly interface indeed, but I could see the subtitles appearing last time I've tried. Wondering what could be wrong there...Yeah, apps leave thing in Application Support, Preferences and so on. But "space waste"... ;) Maybe you lose 1-2GB in a year - not a big deal, after a while you will upgrade your HDD to bigger or will buy a new notebook. So, *usually* dragging app into Trash is enough. ;)I was tried it and OK. And i have both Helvetica and Helvetica Neue too. So, have no idea, yet.hey man iv got the same problem and i didnt find any solution!

Very cheeky regarding Terminal.app as a cocoa app :p loland Avid is $2295.00 .Unfortunately, in 10.6, Finder won't let you rename something to start with a .flag this for moderator attention so they can mark it as community wiki@Nathan Terminal lets me rename files to start with a ., but you're right that Finder does not.@Natthan @jm666 @Michael, thank you guys reply, I post more information for you guys,thanks for your advice, Vimeo and youtube are great but they're banned in China, so the website I post here is my only choiceOh, I misunderstood. In that case, check out www.opensubtitles.org it's a great place to find crowdsourced subtitles.  Also, you can use Vuze (FOSS) to automatically add subtitles to movies in the HD Player. You can drag in any video file to Vuze to play it in the HD Player, then hit the little subtitle icon in the controls bar of the video window and there is an option to add subtitles from a file you already have or to try and find the subtitles automagically from opensubtitles.org.Hm, maybe that's another feature of TinkerTool or something else I've added, as I'm able to rename files in the Finder with a beginning dot. But using `mv` in Terminal is always available, as per @TroyenYou aren't running a case sensitive filesystem are you?Do you have another computer to which you connected your iPod, and synchronized with it?No idea either, I've sent an email to the developer and see if I have any luck.Thanks for the suggestion, but this is a personal video; the subtitles of my video probably wont be available anywhere unless I type them first.On a second try, I'm having some better luck with this app. First it seems that you need to have some particular version of [mplayer installer](http://jubler.org/smf/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=126&start=0), and then one has to click on preferences, wizard to have the program find the path to mplayer. If only the error message would be more informative the first time! Will update later if I have success using this app.What you suggest *might* be a good solution. Basically use Aegisub to get the timing right and then edit the file on a text editor to fix for special characters, etc. I'll play a bit with the suggestions posted here, and then give an update on which combination seemed to work the best.Crosspost: http://stackoverflow.com/q/6355667/557219How do you connect to the Internet? If via airport express, the airport icon has "levels": More the number of "waves" on it, better the strength.Ah yes, sorry I misunderstood. I don't know of a way to do that.Sure, but those Apps make it *very* easy to properly clean things up and in some circumstances it can be a lot more than "1-2 GB in a year", just think of uninstalling Steam by dragging it to the trash. Unless you know where to delete the game files manually, you'll lose 10s of GB of space for no apparent reason.All the volume levels should be remembered by the PRAM. When I reboot my macbook pro both volume settings are remembered correctly.@kiamlaluno: I don't think so, but I'm not 100% sure.I highly recommend CoRD.  It's a RDP protocol remote desktop client.  I find that it's better than the MS client.  http://cord.sourceforge.net/Oh boy - I've heard posterous worked in china - but that was a while back so I have no idea what will route correctly there. Best of luck. Posterous is the way to go here in the US but less good if you are getting blocked by the govenrment/ISP.Sorry to hear - I was afraid there was no API to replicate the behavior of official Mac OS X icons in the menu bar. Every system I have access to is amenable to the last launched app showing up on the left - but I don't use any of your apps. Skitch, Twitterrific, Take Five, BusyCal and Screens work well together. I hope you find a cause or workaround.It will be hard to guess your specific bottleneck. Have you fired up activity monitor to see if RAM or CPU is constrained? Is it disk IO? Have you tried sampling Xcode in instruments to see where it's busy? Adding CPU power if you need better storage would not help much.Trying...stand by.That solves the default folder part of the problem for the most part.  The window size problem is equally as annoying.@Owen It looks good. I'll try it later. Currently, I'm working something other :)I'm editing my answer since my system is saving the size between opens. The dialog sheet comes up centered, but the size is maintained and consistently drawn at that same size that the dialog was last left. Have you rules out a preference bug by trying in a new user?Do you have another Mac laying around that has a working DVD drive?It works! Just got back an email from the developer: there is a small bug in which neither the counter not the subtitles work if you are editing a *new* subtitles script. If you close the app, load a video and some partial script then both meter and subtitles work correctly! Despite the horrible interface, this is perhaps the most functional of the alternatives (it just does what I want to do, easily); but I'll experiment a bit with all the suggestions before accepting an answer.I ask because when I updated the iOS on a Mac, I had the same problem, and it was because I was not using the usual Mac I use to synchronize the iPod, even though it was one of the computers that was authorized.@Juan I'm glad to know both that it worked despite such an annoying bug and the developer is so responsive! Thanks for the feedback. :)I meant "control", not command. In any case, the problem was resolved with a system upgrade and reboot...Unfortunately I don't. One of them is quite old and the second was dropped by me by the accident. So I don't have any laptop that has a working DVD drive :)hmm very weird.. i guess ill have to start disabling fonts and see what fixes the problem.Fantastic, thanks!  TextWrangler has done the job! :-DI would have liked to vote up the answer but I don't have enough reputation on this site yetHa! As if Rogers would unlock it even if you *did* still have service with them.You could get a free copy of PhoneView and use it to examine the results for your particular files. I save files I don't want modified to MobileMe but you could also use DropBox or AirSharing depending on your preferences.Since Xcode 4 is a $5 Mac App store program that anyone can buy, I don't see how this doesn't relate directly to Apple software (and performance running on Apple hardware). My vote is to reopen this...Your speeds are normal for that drive. What sort of data is being written to test the write speeds? Usually test data is compressible and cacheing or zero compression effects are why some VM report faster IO. They get rid of the data and the mac still writes is using the best speed it can. The only difference could be writing to block or raw device and skipping spotlight indexing. Have you tried asking spotlight to not index that drive by listing it in the privacy preference pane under spotlight?I tried DropBox, it doesn't seem to support images of this size.I don't see any options for that: http://cl.ly/7eXd http://cl.ly/7fWcI forgot to mention, I'm on PC.  It looks like PhoneView is OSX.@Tyilo It's in the Presets menu, just under the printer selection menu.Oh my god, I'm stupid :PThe (local) network connection may remain strong (and thus, the icon) even if the connection to the internet becomes problematic.I'm fairly certain that you can't do anything to get the iPod to recognize that the cable has been disconnected except remove it from the headphone jack. I have used an adapter that I have physically severed, and much to my surprise, as long as the 1/8th" jack remained in, it did not notice a different.

It is an analog jack after all.@bmike My guess is that this was closed because of the crosspost."Undervolting does not work with the i5 / i7 MacBook Pro" (ie. it doesn't work for the early 2011 MBPs).@Thilo If you aren't getting the option to "Show Package Contents" then the pkg file was created as flat file. Apple introduced flat-style pkg's a couple years ago@username: So how do I open those?Agreed, nothing practical you can do about it. In OS X several folder extensions are reserved (other examples: .app, .dvdmedia, .pkg) A Service is a kind of application bundle (see the "Finder > Services" menu for example) so OS X will treat folders with this extension as packages.If "TCP Test Tool" can run on the Mac through Wine, you might also consider trying WineBottler to save a self-contained version of "TCP Test Tool." I use WinAmp and TextPad on my Mac like this.People's Republic of China (communist china) or Republic Of China (Taiwan)?Hm. Not a bad hack. Pair it with Grab for hands free pictures.You can use it with the wireless keyboard and mouse when it is installingA variety of other OS X apps also require Cmd-Delete instead of simply Delete, mimicking the Finder.The PhoneView FAQ has a recommendation of a Windows version since they don't plan to make one. AirSharing might be the best bet since I just did the math on the file size - be sure it supports them too.Unfortunately, most apps didn't work I tried. And you can connect to VNC server with Command+K by input something like this: `vnc://server`.where will the log file of launchdaemons be located?mac mini can be installed only with wireless mouse and keyboards?thanks for your answer. so if i get the usb bluetooth, i dont need both usb keyboard and usb mouse?not. will connect the keyboard and mouse to the mac mini via usb! ;)thank very much! now i can sell my windows pc and its mouse and keyboard.how did you make the command, delete and backspace show up as buttons?<kbd>keyname</kbd>[`pkgutil`](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pkgutil.1.html) will do that. 

You can expand it using `pkgutil --expand file.pkg path_to_expand` and it'll convert it into a directory style package.Great simple app.The Mac Mini comes with no bluetooth module installed? Really? I've got a previous version rather than the current version and that certainly came with bluetooth as part of the standard build. It seems odd they would remove something like that.[o rly](http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html)?This answer is absolutely wrongIf it is a one time thing, I would go with a bootable backup using SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner. If it is an ongoing backup policy, Time Machine rules, but a bootable backup is handy. Either way, backup and restore will take several hours.Also, is there a way to *delete* a file, instead of only moving it to the trash bin? I mean, other than "rm" at the prompt?One more point: Open Firmware passwords are easily decryptable. Never set it similar or the same as your user password.When I said "browse", I was referring to browsing the filesystem for files to handle (upload, open, insert, etc).  I use Chrome as a web browser, which is a different term.

I use Entourage for email, and the "insert" function in that program is one example of where I lose the filesystem location from one image to the next, literally within the same email; and Entourage doesn't let you select multiple images at one time for an insert, or else I would.

Other programs, such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator do maintain the last file open location, but still not the window size.I think the issue is that even with GoodReader the images are optimized by the iTunes sync, degrading the quality before they are even opened in the software. Unless I'm missing a piece of how GoodReader works? The app I have now is "Full-Res", which supposedly supports images this large, but after the sync optimization the images don't look right anymore, so I'm guessing GoodReader would be the same.On the Apple Specs page it clearly states "Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR"More discussion here: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2011061520233531+1 - Another [CCC](http://www.bombich.com/) fan here. Once you start using it it's hard to imagine how you got by without it.You can't hit the web site by IP because IIS is not configured to route a request for a given IP to a given web site. Configuring IIS to do so would be the simplest solution. This then becomes an IIS question, not an OS X related question.Buying recommendations are off-topic as per the FAQ (see the site's title bar).I'm pretty sure it is case-sensitive, because UNIX is case-sensitive. Not really sure why that should matter.Syncing GoodReader via iTunes involves dragging the image files into the File Sharing section of the Apps tab. Files transferred into the phone that way aren't processed by iTunes at all and should move to the iPhone unchanged. GoodReader (as well as many other apps) also support alternative methods of file transfer, such as via wifi or special client software.Thank you for clarifying that, I know you mentioned that many other apps do this as well, do you know of any that may cost less then the $5 for GoodReader?Dear lan, can you please upload me an example file?@Adrian: I added an example file. I better not have just done your homework for you.@dpollitt A quick search brought up Files: Document Reader (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/files-document-reader/id294150896?mt=8#) which is free, can show image files and supports transferring files by wifi, iTunes File Sharing and Dropbox.Just using the monitor in the landscape mode for now. Thanks for your help!You actually can, it's quite simple really: http://superuser.com/questions/149329/how-do-i-make-a-post-request-with-curlI'm sorry but I'd greatly appreciate it if you could tell me where is the ` key located.. (Fisical keyboard is in english but my layout is in spanish :S)+1 Nice, exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!This pops up for me once every few days.  Generally it happens when my internet cuts out for a second while iCal is trying to do a refresh.  I've never found it to be harmful.  My advice is just to ignore it.I figured you were using non-apple apps. The file open, file save, and file choose all call the same Apple Code and the apple provided functions will save size and last folder. If the programmer chooses to not use Apple's code - user confusion ensues. See http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/AppFileMgmt/Articles/ConfiguringChooseDialog.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004927-SW1 for the file chooser code. In short, every app that doesn't work like safari does needs to be corrected by the developer to work as you request.OF passwords can be bypassed if you can get to the hard drive inside the machine. Apple does support users with Open Firmware according to this great article. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1352 It's a nice tool and might be perfect for this case (two weeks of security), but once you know how it works, it's easy to break if you have access to the machine.Just calling out the wipe out - most people are so used to files always being saved, that despite the warning that all files will be erased on log out, I've had some people really curse the guest account when an airline itinerary of homework file is nuked when someone else logs them out.FileVault can be a bag of hurt - if the user doesn't have half the drive free - there may not be enough space to encrypt the files or decrypt them later when FileVault is no longer needed. I much prefer using small disk images to only encrypt the files that really need it despite the extra steps and learning needed.It could just as easily be a problem with your Mac. Do you have any other bluetooth devices? Do they experience the same problems?I'm confused - wouldn't it be more of an issue of NTFS attributes that don't save well onto HFS+? (I read your answer as focusing on the other direction) Of course, Time machine might have a horrible time trying to restore data from HFS+ to NTFS since it reads only and won't write to NTFS volumes. NTFS data can quite plainly be ensapsulated on HFS as a disk image or how VMWare and Parallels store NTFS data on the "mac side" where Time Machine will gladly back up that data.Even if you could back it up, how would you use the backup and would you expect Time Machine to restore the data? Since NTFS data doesn't have fsevents, time machine might never track the changes and make hundreds of copies of the same files.I really wonder how much space is used with this trick? Does TimeMachine see the file changes correctly (i.e. not miss files that did change and not back up files that haven't)@Harv: thanks. The frequency is definitely higher for me. More like 5-10 times a day. It does get annoying. Since Internet is stable when it happens as remote `ssh` sessions and what not aren't severed.+1 - Great answer!It happens to me too.Well, I did a test by copying 3GB of compressed movies, so the data is mainly not compressible. I did not deactivate spotlight, but the disk was blank during my test, so I suspect that spotlight is out of cause.The device is connected to the VM as a network drive, shared by the host OS (i.e I can access it as \\psf\LaCie-Rugged) ! I am copying compressed data (movies), so I think that it is safe to say that no data compression is possible during the transfer. I just did the same test again, with 3GB of movies : 52MB/s on the VM, 26MB/s on OSX !I just did the same test with spotlight deactivated, and I still have the same speedI use BusyCal, which syncs to Google Calendar.  I've never seen this problem.Bluetooth has been standard since the last of the G4 Minis in late 2005:

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_MiniBummers. mds and mdworker do process all writes so I was hoping you could eliminate them as a cause. Looks like you did and it wasn't the cause. Unless there's some weird interaction between the source disk for your 3GB files, I can't think of anything you can tune at this point.@Daryl I'm not ready to give up Fantastical which, right now, only works with iCal as a bridge to my Google calendars.Any foreign extended attributes can be encapsulated and stored into HFS+ extended attributes, so the main problem is where Time Machine stores its own metadata.Time Machine attaches metadata to every file that it backs up, not merely in its backup volume but to the original file as well.Really glad you asked this question. Happening with me too. Can't figure it out for the life of me. Are you also getting `Mail.app` opening unexpectedly associated with this? (I don't use `Mail.app` and have yet to configure it - very odd.)Your point (and screenshot) is excellent ... but in fact I have that checkbox off in my preferences!  and it's not lower-right clicking. however, thanks, that was a good idea.@boehj I don't use Mail.app but iCal was opening it on occasion when I had a "send email" notification set in a calendar entry. I had to purge email notifications from my Google Calendar entries to stop both Google and iCal from sending email alerts to me.Ahh... gotcha. I reckon that's what's happening here. I'll do some experimenting here tonight. Top shelf stuff once again @Ian. I'll report back if that's the problem.Have you tried resetting the pram? http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379Yeah I agree they can be bypassed or decrypted, but he said two days, and while he was there, so he would have to be quite a ninja :)By default hfs+ is not case sensitive but you can install it that way. Adobe products will not install on a case sensitive filesystem. - that is why I asked.Was it shipped from apple?Questions about lion are currently off-topic@Drew So the difference between an installer and a dmg with an app in it is simply copying the app to the /Applications directory. This answer (by XQYZ) states why apps are distributed as dmg format, so to answer the question, why do you expect you to drag/drop it? Because it's convention but not required. So they give you the option but you could put it wherever you want. An installer doesn't make sense because the developer doesn't know where you want to place the app. Installers are used when you need to write more files than just an app.Normally i connect via WiFi that is broadcasted by 3G-WiFi router. WiFi is always good, the 3G internet connection quality is in question.Ping window is good, but normally i have lots of windows open like web browser, a number of IDE, documentation, consoles etc - so there is no space i can place console so it will be always visible :(As i can see, geektool normally displays information on th desktops. And i have lots of open windows - so i can't see how desktop can be of any use :(.He just cannot use journaling (which sucks for large drives): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus#LinuxDid you read the question or did you stop at the title? I'm not being ironic, I need to know if I really did explain so bad to earn such an answer, or it was just you.Was it damaged caused by the delivery? http://www.ifixit.com/ should have screens if you're set on doing it yourself.Very interesting, I have iStat too, I will remove it - I never look at it anyway to be honest - thanks.Continue using the cracked app, and then update through the app store when there is an updateHm. As you told, the Wifi MAC can be easily changed. So, you cannot use it for the identify. When you don't want `logon` too, how you want identify the client? IMHO, you will need logon.Thanks a lot . Really loved their Brenthaven ProStyle Slim Pack. Will order that one and try it out.gah, the generic answer@bckbck - Specific answer, just not what you were hoping for.the last part is the generic partIt can display an icon and you can position it in the corner of the menu bar, or use always-on-top mode.@Chealion, @longda: can't get the keyboard shortcut to work either (OS X 10.6.7) :/ Oh well, the menu bar icon is better than nothing.I thought of that; and while it does have curly braces, I can't find angle brackets under any of them.  It wasn't under any brackets at all that I saw.So is that code I can deploy per application if I can figure out which file that app calls for the open or choose dialog?  DefaultFolderX seems to handle this very thing quite well, but like I said, not the dialog sizing.I think of something I want to remember while working out, I send myself a note on the iPhone and then move it to the relevant application when I get home on my Mac.

I see a link I want to read on my iPhone, I send it from my Mac to my iPhone.

I find a link I want to read on the larger screen of my Mac, I send it from my iPhone to my Mac.

Right now I use email for this and it is needlessly circuitous and leaves a mess of emails where I don't want or need permanent records.It only syncs if I connect the device and wait for all manner of other things to sync. I want this done quickly, wirelessly, and all from the same app. Also, I don't want bookmarks. I want to just quickly look at a link. I don't want to have to create a bookmark and delete it later when I am finished with it. I'm sorry, but this is a bad solution and nothing close to what I am asking for.Have you tried [ReadItLater](http://readitlaterlist.com/)?"I can't see why you need this". Wow. I thought I made it pretty clear in the question why I need this: to quickly send links, pictures, and notes. Syncopy is closer to what I need than most, but still not what I am looking for.@Chris "quickly" is too vague, that's why I asked the scenario and then it made little more sense. Thing is, often we **think** we need something while we really don't, because there's a better way to do it. I can say that for myself and a lot of things apple do work with this in mind. - And I thought I made it pretty clear I'm shooting in the dark here, because I don't identify with your needs and I hardly know those tools such as iMessage or Droplr. :)Yes - you could theoretically patch each program individually just like some people provide cracks to avoid licensing checks. It would be a serious lot of work finding the routines and re-doing the work each time the application gets updated. Are you sure the sizing difference you see isn't related to different document window sizes and not some default? My sizes stay larger for most apps once I change it.Got it - I wasn't reading your answer correctly to match my view that "without fseventsd tracking the NTFS data, TimeMachine may not work as you expect" Luckily, by nature the NTFS data should be static whenever Mac is running so TimeMachine won't stomp all over race conditions as the NTFS data is being written at the same time as a back up event.@geekosaur - do tell more on how Time Machine actually writes metadata to each file it backs up. Does it write that metadata to TimeMachine volume only, or does it modify metadata on the original file each pass. I'm not up to speed on the intimate details of fseventsd but I assumed that process logged things and Time Machine just read from it's store and didn't do any local writing to the source files other than to copy them...It's not at all clear what you're asking for. I don't see what any of this has to do with iMessage or what exactly you're trying to do. If syncing isn't the answer just text or email yourself the link/note/picture.Your question might get more precise answers if you edit it to clarify 1) Do you want these tools without waiting or upgrading to iOS 5? 2) If you are not going to iOS5 or are going to upgrade but they still don't meet your needs this information might help get the best answer for you and others.I tried to tap and enter but it's not workingThis sounds good (and it's been voted twice) but how do we know these are the only ways?  If you have to know to search out the "enterprise documentation" (wherever that is), could it be that there are other specific Apple documents which mention that they can wipe the device, too, only we didn't think to look at them?Document reader worked.  It has a maximum file size of 5000x5000px which is kind of limiting, but it is still better then the built in Photo application, thanks!Sorry, typo - not lion at all, I meant 10.**6**.7 not 10.7Reopened the question.Seriously? Curly brackets but no Angle Brackets? Scary...is localhost up, is a server running ? That should be the first step.Okay, sorry, but how to I check that?+ you need to add *ad infinitum* more things to the list. Probably by the time I'd had all conditions calibrated I would need to replace the current iMac :-D Maybe just some external basic W & kWh meters would do the trick, if there are no meters onboard.@Jon The same way you checked for the script, type it into Safari `http://localhost/`Oh, ya, I've tried that before. NO same error.Do this in a terminal: "ps -eaf | grep httpd"; if you get anything more than the "grep" line, things are running (but may need restarted). Otherwise Apache isn't running at all. (I've had occasions on other platforms where Apache will be running with httpd processes, but not respond to requests, so it is worth a check to see if there are processes running.)`501 15383 15378   0   0:00.00 ttys003    0:00.00 grep httpd` appeared when I ran the grep line... so I guess it's not running?Unfortunately, I've restarted the Web Sharing many times but it still doesn't work. I've run them before (after changing the permissions) but still nothing... Thanks though. Seems like the problem is deeper than I thoughtUndoing some injustice :PNope seems not.If I double-click /usr/sbin/httpd I get the following:

`httpd: Could not open configuration file /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf: No such file or directory
logout`

Does this mean I need to put apache2 into the etc folder? Why wasn't it there to begin with?THANKS! That solved my problem! The folder wasn't there (Should I post this in the Answer section?)... more checks: `apachectl configtest` and @Kerri Shotts worked this time too.I'd like to avoid the logon for ease of use...if I have 5 laptops that always connect, having them logon each time can be a hassle.  If there's no other way, however, I'll go with logons - do you know of a method using logons ?I'm not sure what you mean by "handle them sooner manually"...iCal is automatically deleting these old calendar entries without my intervention after 30 days.  Can you elaborate more on your answer?The bug shows itself when I'm using either my Logitech M500 or Razer Death Adder.No luck with this solution. It sounded so right too, darn. Thanks for the suggestion.@Jon what does it say in your logs? Check `/var/log/apache2/error_log` after you try and view the web page.@ghoppe see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16116/safari-cant-connect-to-the-server-localhost#comment-17634Odd - then your phone has issues with the touch or the software. You might need to restore or troubleshoot things. I tested on three other devices after seeing that my experience was different than yours. I've never seen what you describe and have helped many people with VoiceOver so it's not a common fault. I hope someone else has an idea - it's certainly not working as advertised for you.If you let email add appointments, you have to notice them and take action before they auto-delete. You would have to accept or decline or otherwise clean each one up.:-) Glad you got the humor. My experience is that the macs draw 20 to 25% less than the specifications published by Apple even under rigorous tests to get ***everything*** drawing at max power.Macs are very eco friendly and the testing of a unit is done by Apple as well as labs with calibrated test rigs. Luckily we can use the settings to maximize the macs we have while they come up with more efficient models tomorrow.I could be wrong, but I doubt it. I've regularly gone through all publicly available documentation with a fine tooth comb. For a third party app to erase the phone, it would have to be a live jailbreak. Those are pretty well published and I didn't mention them as I don't follow that side of things close enough to speak with any confidence.As long as you don't run the app from any user that has admin privileges, your trust will be upheld. Don't forget that even a user level app can make requests from admin level processes so it's a lot of work to run apps you don't actually trust.Note that while I ended up finding a solution and answering my own question, I'm open to easier or more versatile solutions. Also the process of discovering this is not clear. For example where do you find key codes and action names if I wanted to remap more keys? Feel free to add answers if you have relevant knowledge!Thanks @Lri, the extra links and existing bindings were exactly what I was looking for. Also, LibreOffice seems to respond just fine to the remapped keys.At least wait for few more betas.This question has already been addressed here, check out http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14579/why-does-the-ipad-use-nearest-neighbour-scaling-rather-than-retina-scaling-for-ipThanks although you closed my topic! :) The link helped answering my question, I didn't find it before posting my duplicate.System Preferences -> Accounts -> specific account -> Login works but how to disable a process?Thanks.  So, it's **required** for the iPhone to be on WiFi?If you are the user then just delete from this preferences pane - if for another user then can't if they can run it at another time - if they can run they can choose to run on loginI'll add a picture to show the command for deleting an item if it's found in the Login Items preference pane.I am asking how to install Windows on mac mini server not MBA.The drive was initially released and named for the Air - which was the first mac without an optical drive. The Mini Server is the second and also uses that drive to let bootcamp work.iOS4 only allows FaceTime on iPhone when WiFi is on. iOS5 (not yet released) has been announced to let each carrier decide to allow or deny non-WiFi FaceTime. The hardware is ready, the software is expected sometime this Fall. I'm sure they are polishing the UI, but the big part is making it work with only the carriers that want to allow or bill for 3G FaceTime.Does it support ID3v2?Phone Amego looks perfect. Thanks!Do you use Last.FM for scrobbling? I've noticed quite a few instances of losing position and scrobbles. Might be related?You could install windows under virtual box.lion questions are currently off-topic.+1 for mentioning ZFS :)ZFS would've been great from a technical perspective, but became a non-option the moment it was announced that Oracle might buy Sun.  AIUI there's just no way Apple was going to give Oracle that sort of licensing leverage.Can you set your email accounts so that the password must be given in order to access them from the iPod?  Maybe in Preferences, insert dummy passwords.  Then after you get the phone back, insert the real passwords.Just browsed a bit and for now im sure than versioning will need support from developer, so the application must be built with some API to support versioning. It is **not** OS level.turn off your iphone when you're driving :PHmm the trick doesn't quite work for me. When you say "Switching to any album other than the current one", it just means to click the album, right?I believe this only works if you're using the column browser.Just a heads-up, you'll need Rosetta to run the compiled version of this that downloads (so it won't work on Lion). The solution is to open the download in AppleScript Editor and Save As. This will recompile it for Intel.My guess: If migration assistant assigns a new UUID when you migrate a user to a new machine, I don't think you should mess with that. And regarding your final question: I don't know if OS X ever does determine that two users on two different machines are the same. It would be scary if any file sharing protocol ever made that decision based on uid, for example.horizontal is also not so bad if you use a cooling stand that has a fan in the base to blow cold air onto the bottom of the laptopIf I have two wifi's with the same settings (ssid, encryption-method & pw, channels and such..) won't the two interfere in one way or another?Apple doesn't use the term Release Candidate, or at least I haven't seen it the one time I was involved (iOS 4). It was: Beta 1 -> Beta 2 -> Beta 3 -> Beta 4 -> GM Seed less than a week before iOS 4 rolled out to the masses.@Nathan - correct, will modify my answer.How do I observe the flags for an interface?The utility can be downloaded from: http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/@Harald NFS does work exactly that way by default. File ownership is determined by UID. There are options to change that, like mapping root to nobody.  This works fine when users are centrally managed and don't have admin access to their machines, or are trusted at some level.You can see a detailed status in the terminal using `ifconfig`. I have updated the answer accordingly.Horizontal-but-upside-down. Most heat diffuses through the base not the top (especially if the lid is closed, adding an additional insulating layer). Heat rises. Mounting it upside down will allow the heat to escape most efficiently. Add a fan to improve.Thank you for the clarification. Pardon my ignorance, but what exactly are IPv6 services?IPv6 is the next generation of the internet protocol (IP) that is designed to succeed the version that is currently in use. To allow smooth migration and enable early adoption, there are a few services and protocols that allow to encapsulate IPv6 in IPv4 Packets (and vice versa). Those usually operate using aforementioned stf/gif interfaces. For detailed information regarding IPv6 see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)But better to sudo the one command rather than run under a shell as rootafter hours of research, it seems that OS X 10.6 needs the scanner to be TWAIN compliant in order for scanning to work 'natively' within the OS.  I had decided to go with HP simply because I've always thought of them as being the leaders in the business, you know, what with having developed some of the first/best printer drivers - I hear the HP LaserJet 4 driver is the basis for most other manufacturers drivers.  Anyway, I found a similarly priced printer with cheaper toner and maintenance costs, and TWAIN compliance from Brother, and I'm going to replace my printer with one. ThanksAh smart, I didn't think of that.@romeovs: Windows, even under VirtualBox, requires a licence (which I stated I do not have) and system updates each and every time I start the virtual machine. I am looking for an application, not an operating system.A number of factors, including age, heat, driver crash. Since you cannot reproduce the problem, it could be random and will never happen again.I've seen some people do this actually.From Google's docs on how to set up a CalDAV-based link to your calendars in iCal: http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358#ical -- that's the URL they give you to connect iCal to your Google calendar. Also note: failures aren't reproducible. One refresh it will fail, the next it will not.@Jason Ah, indeed you're right. I think of it as a release candidate because it really isn't a "golden master" since there are commonly one or two revisions of said master before it goes live. "Golden master" is supposed to mean the final version, the one from which all distributed copies are made, while release candidates allow for changes. Alas.This is a nice suggestion but doesn't quit discriminate between successful attempts and failed attempts.

Take a look at my update above.Although I realize now you want something more conspicuous than leaving either the terminal or Console utility open...Out of curiosity - do you have Smart Traveler or just experienced a similar issue in another context?GM Seed stands for Gold Master Seed.i've setup 2 extremes in the same office block with all same settings and its worked perfectly to date, clients automatically select the strongest signal of the 2upside down will place extra pressure on the screen that its not neccesarily designed to take and may damage your screen - i've seen this happen with the odd MBP being too tightly squeezed in bagsThis is aimed at others viewing the question, not you senseful: if you arent please don't install it even if it was stable enough. The betas care for developers to get a headstart on app compatibility and to test and report bugs. Not for non developers to show it off to their friends and clog the developer forums by asking how to install or yell that something isn't working and demand it to be fixed.@KeithB: Sure, but NFS is sort of an oddity in the MacOS world. Which doesn't stop me from using it at home (my fileserver runs FreeBSD). Point taken, though.since running `code` cp -u /private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/*.* /private/var/backup `code` directly in shell has no problem copying the files, so I believe the problem isn't about the argument of cpIt would be great if you could pull Console and tell us what you see there in the moments before these events. We can go from there. Have you installed anything new lately that you can remember? Any particular program that you have running that may be the culprit?GM either stands for "Golden Master" or for "Gold Master", Apple uses it both ways: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_master -- either way, it means the final version to be sent off for reproduction as CDs or DVDs. That means the final version. I am noting that practically that's not was Apple does, however: Xcode 4, for example, had two different GM Seeds.Oops, I read over that. I just proposed this because it's the easy way out...Duplicates we can live with; we can weed afterwards. She's back from vacation this week - I'll give it a try...thanks!hmmm. [saw this on superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/299613/100-finder-cpu-usage-a-call-for-help-i-have-just-about-given-up). must have been cross-postedWe've already had lots of window management questions. See [What Window Management Options Exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) and [Can I get Windows 7-like resizing on Mac OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/557/can-i-get-windows-7-like-window-resizing-on-mac-os-x).Yeah, that is not what I am speaking off though. I guess my question is: Is there a more reliable app like "Stay" that I could get?I know, which is why I didn't close this question.Turn off your microwave owen. ;) (Just kidding) IMHO Macbook has a bit lower sensitivity as iPhone - at least mine has.I rarely (and not currently) work with exchange. Sadly I've never used smart traveler so only have an educated research. I have seen hundreds of phones with corrupt contacts databases where enabling or disabling an account produces surprising results. So lots of similar issues and generally clearing the database helps. Often it fixes the issue, but if not it also squarely points the blame to a systematic software conflict.I would add to this good list, sample finder when it is running poorly using activity monitor. What processes are also getting CPU when this happens? Does this happen when all networks are disconnected? what are the disk activity and network levels when this happens? All of these will help narrow down the cause. Once it's narrow, the cure is easily evident.Yeah, you're right! I'm forgot the sampling. Great comment :)I don't think that's true to the extent you're saying it is: http://www.macrumors.com/2011/02/03/apple-seeds-golden-master-of-xcode-4-to-developers/

Yes, it was up, disappeared, then went back. But I don't think there was a functional change of content. If it was, surely it was an installer change, one not requiring OS 10.7+, and not a change to Xcode itself.+1: I'd call to the Adobe support first. And only to inform about the alternatives: VMware Fusion is a viable alternative to Parallels; just don't ask anyone which is better.Ian, I'm told that Fastastical works just fine with BusyCal.  (I haven't got around to trying it yet.)thanks so much for the suggestions!  i cant wait to get home from work to try them out!  will keep everyone posted -- much thanks.I'm pretty sure it's not a UI oversight as it was done deliberately.Are you aware that you can create a PDF file from any document you can print in OS X? If that's not sufficient, what additional features do you need in your PDF files?Having used all 3 GM seeds of Xcode 4 (the last one of which was the same as the final release), I can tell you that there were in fact significant bug fixes in each one (and even a couple of functionality changes). Were you downloading them and using them every day? I ask because you seem very certain of something that I have repeatedly experienced differently.I have one pdf file I want to edit it and save it back in pdf.While this will create basic PDFs, you can't employ advanced PDF features like layers (to name but one) if you do it this way, hence my comment on the original question.Hmm, okay... I'm not aware of any free software for OS X that will allow you to directly edit PDFs. http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/ is probably the cheapest/best-known option, but that costs $60. If you don't need to maintain the resolution independence of the original document, you could edit it in a free graphics application like GIMP and save it back out as a PDF bitmap, but I guess that's not what you want...@Umesh Kacha I recognize English may not be your first language, but this is not "creating" pdfs. This is editing pdfs. You may want to edit your question.+1 for PDFpen. Besides that, there's only Acrobat Pro.What do you mean? Convert another file into pdf or actually build a pdf file? The first one is built-in into mac os (`print>PDF>Save as PDF...`), for the latter I'd use Latex (pdflatex). It's a bit hard to learn but it's a very powerful tool!Best option when she installs iTunes the first time and connects the iPhone is to disable the automatic Syncing (like I told you) and then select Backup in iTunes. That way, all the data in the iPhone will get backed up into iTunes, instead of iTunes erasing the iPhone...@anthony not an issue if you don't put stuff on it. The weight of the case doesn't compare to a squeezing.I did not use Xcode 4 prior to it's general availability, as our account was no longer a paid account at that time. I'll defer to your personal experience in Xcode 4 specifically. I simply don't remember hearing the news of repeat Xcode 4 GM Seed releases, outside of the one I linked.@MatthewFrederick let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/581/discussion-between-vxjasonxv-and-matthew-frederick)What exactly do you want to send? iPod music from iPhone A to iPhone B? Since Airport Express doesn't have speakers, it's hard to map how an iPhone B will replace that item. I use a belkin bluetooth reciever to get sound from iPhone A to a mini jack which is more like the Airport Express functionality.I was really looking for a native solution, but I guess this or Neil's answer are the closest one.I also have it broken (OS-X Lion Preview4) but I don't have any "set -o vi" settings. Ctrl-A does not have any effect! WTF? I cannot use screen to switch or create new screen sessions.no, it does not work.Transmit Rate = 2. Is that good?

The problem is, if I am outside the range where the Macbook Pro can use wi-fi, I get a "Connection Timeout" response when I try to connect to the network. Once I come back close to the router, I would have to turn airport off and back on, re-enter the password a couple times before it connects again.RSSI = -55 in the good spotsAny word on Thunderbolt --> FireWire adapters? I'm looking to replace my ageing MacBook with one of the upcoming 13 inch Airs. I have a FireWire sound card though and I'd need an adapter to hook it up.For those interested, someone pointed me here --> http://www.sonnettech.com/news/nab2011/index.html.Ok, so it was deliberate. Then the inability to **change** the setting is a UI oversight. In either case, it's idiotic.Three things that caused similar 100% CPU usage for me in the past: 1. Time Machine backup (after a long time. May happen if you backup to n external drive that is no always connected), 2. QuickSilver (I had it once when I upgraded and one other time) and 3. Firefox. (Of these TimeMachine and QuickSilver may be running in the background)You can turn off the Fraud warning in Settings->Safari. That might help vYou should update to 4.latest-for-your-iPhone. Yoour version of iOS is tracking your gps. Perhaps you travel a lot? Upgrade to the latest iOS and turn off location for a day. See if that helps the growth.Do these clean Firefox cookies which are not in ~/Library/Cookies ?I guess this answers my question partially. The StartOnMount option specifies the script to run when a disk is mounted. What I really want is my script to launch when a server is available on the network. I will look into launchd's man pages see if there is anything I can use.Are you sure then none of the systems go to sleep? Perhaps you have checked this already but this is one of the "classic" symptoms in such situations.[Cross-posted to SU.](http://superuser.com/questions/299970/is-there-a-way-to-execute-on-applescript-when-a-server-becomes-available)I'll try it when I get home and keep you posted :)Based on WWDC keynote as well as beta preview, no home screen rotation for iPhones on iOS5 that I can see. SBRotator still the only option, albeit not ideal.I disagree. Not *everyone* expects or wants enter to open folders in the finder. Renaming folders is convenient with enter; using command + arrows for navigation makes sense and is easy. In list view, what's the "opposite" of enter? How do I get out of the folder? With command-up: open parent, command-down: open folder, it makes sense and is symmetrical. People who insist that it is "wrong" or "idiotic" are simply used to another OS.@Fake Name Using just the delete key to move an item to the trash is a bad idea. I'm editing a file name, I hit delete to delete characters. Oops, there it goes. Ah, you say, but the Finder checks what mode you're in. What if I forgot what mode I was in? Shortcuts need to be consistent. How hard is it to hold down command + delete?Sorry if I wasn't clear. With an Airport Express, I can hit the AirPlay button in any app in iOS4 and choose said AirPort Express as my output target. With speakers hooked into the AirPort Express's headphones jack, I then have wireless, remote audio that'll work without special software on the sending device.

I'd like to be able to target an old iPhone, running a theoretical "AirTunes receiver" app that would be hooked up to speakers via it's headphone jack. I'm just wondering if that "AirTunes receiver" app exists. Open Source or Jailbreak would be fine...Transmit rates less than 10 are really slow - generally there is a problem with interference or hardware if that's the best you can get on several channels and sitting 10 to 15 feet away from the base station with no walls in the way.WDS and internet sharing need a wifi link - not an ethernet link so that's not an option unless the OP substitutes a third base station for the PLC link. Devices generally only hop if the link is lost even if you get in range of the same SSID with a better strength. The rest of your points are solid!I don't agree that the event isn't mine...It's on my Calendar, so it's mine nowI meant that since it wasn't created from your calendar on your phone, you don't have the privileges to edit it. These types of events are generally used for meetings and such where one person is in charge and can edit the event as needed, but all the attendees don't have the privilege to edit the event because they aren't running it, hence "not theirs" in big air quotes.Got it. iPhone + software + speakers = JamBox over WiFi instead of Bluetooth. If no-one has any software, you could go with Belkin over bluetooth and connect it to your speakers, but that's an alternative, not an answer...Do be aware that I had a friend add an external hard drive to their mac. It was 1TB and Time machine was told to back it up. My friend ended up with Time Machine deleting everything except for the backup from the day before so only having one copy on the Time Machine means a software bug or change in the system can make them get automatically deleted with no warning or chance for you to save them.@Mark I cannot confirm that at the moment, but I'll test (I have Cocktail).i know that but i don't know what to put in!Take a look at the different alternatives we've found so far in AskDifferent: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/9659/115No, the Mac Pro (1,1) and Mac Pro (2,1) don't support the same video card hardware.Do you mean that time machine was told to back up to this harddrive or he told it to back up the actual harddrive onto another. There is a setting in time machine preferences to warn when it is deleting old backups, so that can be helpful in this case as wellI believe external drives default to be excluded from Time Machine. My friend absolutely clicked the button to include those drive over a period of months. Just that they were not all present and loaded with data until later when the surprise delete event happened. It was user error to be totally clear. It's just understandable how it happened in hindsight. It was too easy to delete all the backups - I feel Time Machine should delete one or two backups and then warn/stop - not erase 15 months of backups due to a sudden increase of disks attached.related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7997/how-do-i-replace-the-hard-drive-in-my-circa-2008-imacThanks! It gives me some more to think about :)(Now that firefox is moving to a quicker release cycle, they will need a new extension model. Making me upgrade and check compatibility with each release can be brutal.)Here's how to see what an SSD will do for you. Turn off wifi, reboot your mac and launch only Xcode and quit it. Then launch marsedit and quit it. Then mail + things and quit. Then launch things a second time with most of the files cached in ram. Running lots of apps concurrently is the perfect case for SSD. You won't believe how much better programs with many files open behave. (Mail, iCal, Xcode, etc...)Lyken wins the prize with this answer. What an amazing piece of software. Command line tool, menu bar, and full app. Unless the power supply itself is monitored in new macs, it won't give a total power rating, but this sure does a great job accessing all the data that is available.The new iMacs have two slots for storage and the cable locations are substantially different.An SSD in my old MBPro was a a great move. But here's a caution: SSDs are not conventional hard drives and they aren't nearly as reliable. They can fail unexpectedly and when they do failure is pretty spectacularly bad. Make 100% certain you're running Time Machine at regular intervals. The speed boost is worth the risk and the new life it'll breath in to old hardware IMO. But understand that it comes with some risk.Ian C - well said - SSD are like experimental race cars and motorcycles and when they crash it is spectacular. I speculate the cost of apple SSD is buying reliability past what the open market is selling as they often are on the hook for 3 years of service.No my idea was to swap the SSD for a 500GB hard drive install OS X, Debian and windows on to that then configure the 2TB drive to run as the document storage to so when loaded in any OS can access all the data. I asked the question to see if I had to order the 2 hard drive option to get the space in the chassis.A lot of judgement goes into making a recommendation - I've had bad and good even at the Apple stores. Some photoshop users feel the CPU on the air is inadequate, but I know many people that are bowled over how capable the air is. If he's happy with Photoshop on his 2007 MacBook, then no need for a larger mac. It will be interesting to see how fast a ThunderBolt bump happens on the air line. They are still listed as NEW on the product page.That will be a sweet lineup! Do read the take apart - with care and some prior experience, many people that have good physical motor skills and patience can DIY. It's just a whole lot harder than a PC tower or a Mac Pro / portable install. Those are easy to swap a HD - not so with the current iMacs. Do use care to make sure a temp sensor is present - I'm going to edit my answer to call that out.Yeah I understand that I'm good with apple repairs having repaired several iMacs before. So should be easy. It just takes time.anything what will say, is pure guessing. Check my answer for updates.Phew - I'd hate to encourage someone that was getting in over their head. It would take me maybe 15 minutes to do that repair - so it's easy when you are familiar with the hardware. The 27 are rocket ships - enjoy!@dassouki: Interested to see how you go with this. I want to do something similar.I have an Apple wireless trackpad.Perhaps my sarcasm filter is off this early in the morning, but: "The Apple SSD is expensive because due to buying the best drives in bulk (way cheaper than we consumers can buy them) and the labor for them is almost nil as they are installed at the most economical time - at assembly." ???@ghoppe - Christ, did you read my comment? I additionally specified that the **inability to change the setting** is the really stupid thing. Also, the inverse of enter is backspace, as it has been since long ago. Apple is the one who decided we needed two delete keys, which still doesn't make much sense to me.@ghoppe - That's because OS X has that nutty "Two Delete keys" thing. The button above backslash is the backspace button. The button in near "Home" and "End" is the delete key. It's a hell of a lot harder to accidentally press when typing.@ghoppe - At best, the button above backspace should be "Backwards Delete". Apple decided to change key names on their own. As it is, they have "Delete", which is a backwards operation, and "Forward Delete", which is just delete everywhere else (And the key I am referring to).is the trackpad surface clean, and there is nothing metallic/conductive that could be brushing it's surface?Are you on Thunderbird 3? I have 12 accounts with ~7000 e-mail between them in Thunderbird 3, and it's still really fast. Mozilla completely rewrote the mail-database system in the switch between 2 and 3 (Went from giant MBOX files to a SQL DB).@massimogentilini "Basically the only way," unless you've heard of the Internet. Also, the eject key on a regular system has no effect on non-removable media volumes.Not quite correct - the MacBook Air's keyboard is the only one that contains the power button in place of the usual location of the eject key. All other MacBooks' power buttons are located at the top right of the bezel.Just to clarify, are you literally trying to find a folder named `user's library`?XD no.. `~/Library/Application\ Support/iCal` doesn't exist.I figured that was what you meant, but I just wanted to be sure. I actually don't have that folder either. It looks like that discussion was about Tiger, not Snow Leopard.I have also just tried to close iCal, moved `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist` and `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.helper.plist` to the Desktop and still no luck.Luckily, I didn't have any data stored locally so I just removed all contents in that folder. Thanks!Yes, I use a newer Logitech mouse and no matter what I do I can't replicate the same motion/acceleration/speed I'm used to in Windows. I do think this is a function of the driver/utility from Logitech though.Doesn't work, and still the same errorWe'll need a lot more info to help you. What happens when you connect the mouse? Does it need drivers? What mouse is it?@Nathan no drivers required, Apple mighty mouse A1152. Actually, nothing happened when the mouse connected.I will give this a go. I was concerned because when the problem first started occurring I was in a position to clear and recreate my contacts and the duplication always came back... but I will try this. Thanks.Do you have MacOS X Server and are you part of that server's Open Directory?What do you do to your computer that requires daily use of *two* disk repair tools on a daily basis?I use IMAP and Thunderbird and it is one of the best email clients I have ever used. Mail and Entourage are both bad with IMAP. I have heard good things about MailMate, but I have not tried it yet.wtf 48GB of RAM?? Can you actually use that much? (This question is not to be rude to you, I just genuinly want to know what application uses that much RAM).Do you know if the Linux Volume(s) were set up using LVM some non-standard partition schema? Can you show how Disk Utility displays that disk?I'd say buy an SSD. The speed gain is quite a lot. In computing, I believe that delaying what to buy is the best strategy. If you'd want to buy a Macbook Air now, you'll be drooling over a new Macbook Air in 2012, 2013, and so on...Up vote for magic trackpad or Microsoft mouse options. The only ways to go IMHO.It was added *to* a calendarMan - I really botched that sentence. no sarcasm intended - I'll edit the answer - you're totally right it makes no sense and is very wrong.Do you have some more information on how "a simple sticky notes on top and always." would look? Are you looking for a jailbreak solution where the stick note overlays the normal iOS springboard interface. Or is on top referring to how the app looks only when it's running?The implications of "each app is a sandbox with separate data" security measures is causing your pain. Once you look at the system that way - you see you are asking to bypass security for arbitrary apps. This isn't going to be easy. Basically, you need apps like safari to offer to store a video to the film roll just like they add/copy still pictures. It's really up to Apple to provide this so developers can use it.I have an installation of OSX Server with an OD that is for the machines, there is also a separate AD which the machines point to as well. The Server itself is in the AD. Our AD can't handle the OD Mac extensions... too old.Thanks, Just connecting directly was the step I was missing, the AirDisk doesn't show up in Disk Utility normally.@brmike, I don't think this is even a consistent application of the walled garden/sandbox/whatever, though.   Apple lets its own mail as well as other 3rd party apps save photos to the Photos app, but not videos.I manage an Apple Authorized Service Provider location. We work on different machines daily that are in and out of warranty and these tools plus others are great.Unless you're using an IDE that is not available for OS X and you don't want to use anything else, there shouldn't be any issues in these fields. OS X is the platform of choice for many Java and Ruby programmers.Hi hotpaw2, so have you done this migration before? So I think in general I'll have no problems.HFS+ is case insensitive, but it is also case preserving.It's important to note that in OS X you will have to access the "console" (called Terminal in OSX) less often, and when you do, things like /usr /etc will still be there.@Senseful even Floppy Drives used to work like that on System 9! :)@NReilingh You're correct, but the keyboard is the *same*, except for the power button. The Eject button is still there, and will not perform any action unless you have a DVD drive to eject. ;)None of what you are describing is normal at all. I'd start again from scratch trying to investigate what's the culprit.You can configure your OS X account(s) to start up Terminal on login giving you a command-line console right from the start.@Fake Name Sorry, I guess you have a non-standard usage of the phrase **in either case** which I am unfamiliar with.  Mac conventions (in the Finder) are that command *shortcuts* use the command key. This is in my view a good thing, it allows you to edit names without modal worries. Not allowing non-command key shortcuts seems to me to be a pretty minor shortcoming. Having multiple options to use other OS conventions is a big can of worms to open. I'm fine with third-party utilities for this.@Fake Name As for the two delete key thing, I'm not sure why Apple decided to go against ISO standards on that. Maybe because the backspace key on typewriters only moves the carriage and doesn't delete things and they wanted to be explicit? Regardless, it's a trivial difference.Actually, there IS a root account, it's just not enabled by default.I also use iTerm, which supports tabs.  :D  http://iterm.sourceforge.net/@Harv Correct -- you have to deliberately enable "root", and it's also probably a good idea *not* to do it. However, it's typically a good idea when you first come to a fresh OSX install to log in "very first" as "Administrator" with a different password, *then* afterwards create another account for your daily use. When you need to do "administration-type stuff" like installing applications, doing updates, and the like, you can then switch your login to logging in as the Administrator user.@Harv, as of recent OSX releases, Terminal.app also supports tabs. This lets you start several shells, all attached to separate pseudo terminals. However, again, pseudo terminals are, technically, not completely equatable to "consoles", depending on how one wants to use that term (one might say that a pseudo terminal device, like Terminal.app attaches to, is a *kind* of console, and a particularly *limited* kind of one).Viktor, this is exactly what I had in mind. Linux supports switching to a different virtual console with ALT-F1 to F6, plus F7 for the X Window System, if I recall correctly. Many Linux users incorporate this feature into their workflow.This is exactly what I was looking for. AirDisplay solves the problem. CocoPad lacks some features like easier color swap, but in the end it will do. Thanks!What about software to create animations and such? See my question: http://superuser.com/questions/300457Let's not forget about X11. By default when lunched it opens xterm and there you can do all of your Linux-centric things. Once working under Tiger I managed to install and switch into Enlightenment Window Manager - just for fun. Possibilities are there but then the question remains do we need it?thanks for the feedback. I think you've got the point I needed. In general for development purposes ain't no changes, besides you can get practically everything from Linux and a bit more. I'm really considering to achieve my iMac 21.5". By now I'll keep my Linux notebook to fulfill my needs and my hacker spirit (since Mac OS X does not allow us a lot of that). I came here to ask something else, because I haven't found anything good about this issue. Thanks again :DTried that one. It's no good without the ability to set curves.That website seems to recommend the Arc mouse. Is it possible to use another Microsoft mouse with that same Intellipoint software?Some more questions: Are there good apps for free to work with: graphics, sound and image edition? If you have an iMac 21.5", is it good for running HD videos?I *think* the intellipoint drivers work with any (or most) microsoft mice.+1 Sparrow is the best Mail app on the Mac, bar none. That may change with Apple Mail on Lion, but for now I have permanently switched to Sparrow.They will say no. That is all.My instinct says Apple would not respond to my questions as they have no option for graphic cards other than 2 AMD models. Guess I should stick to stock cards. Thanks anyway Mosche.what do you mean for the life of my itunes account? isn't my itunes account forever?that's way cool, btw where did you got that info from?Till the end of time? Probably not. But you can safely assume that your iTunes account will be around for as long as you actually need it. Stuff like this eventually be replaced by something else.Sounds great - I'll give it a try this weekend. Thanks!OK, cool, I worried for my sanity a little there. :)You are right, I could understand Asphalt 1, 2, etc., it's a game and everything inside it changes, graphics, interface and gameplay, so if you like V2 you play it instead of V3 because we are talking about different experiences, but for an app is unfair, because it isn't an experience, different in every game, first of all it's a service, and if you've paid for it you should still get the most up to date in exchange of support and feedback. Pay the app every time is a Microsoft/Adobe money eater politics.Thank you very much for this explanation! Only one question: where to perform the first step?@Pacerier I only put it that way in an effort to make it clear that they're tied to your account; no, they don't expire. If you didn't have access to your account for some reason -- forgot your password and were unable to recover it, lost it in a divorce, whatever -- then you'd no longer have access to the apps.I'm also curious where you learned that: I don't remember having ever heard it from Apple.When you set up your virtual machine (or after it is created in the preferences)Ok, I updated my question...You need to reboot the virtual machine (or refresh your dhcp-lease).AW-SOME :-) Thank youMy 13" MBP runs HD video just fine, same as WoW or SC2 with decent framerate and its equipped with only Intel HD3k Card. iMac will have high end Radeon and i5, so no problem there. As for apps - Gimp works, althrough it doesn't have the right look and feel. I am sure there are apps which will be sufficent for you.@Juan - just wondering about your final solutionHave you looked in the Archived Items folder? I think that's where stuff is on the Mac version, so it may be worth a shot.Also, I don't believe the Kindle app supports ePub documents.was this a problem before updating to 10.6.7?@Nathan Looked under the archived items in hope that the books might appear there. But it's empty. And I don't really mind if the ePub format doesn't work or is not supported; most of my books are in PDF anyway. I was just trying another file format to see if it helped. Thanks for looking into this.You're also missing Printer Sharing, Web Sharing, Xgrid Sharing, and Internet Sharing.Is this a corporate or school-owned computer? If so, my guess would be that someone has disabled these functions for security purposes.@Matthew @Pacerier I thought it was common knowledge. http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/11/jobs-60-million-iphone-apps-downloaded-confirms-kill-switch/ Google has one, too, and they've had to use it.The archived items menu contains books you have purchased (or got for free) from Amazon, but that you have deleted from your device. This is where you go to redownload them to your device.Thanks for the suggestion. I'm gonna use iBooks to avoid converting.How did you know this? I went through the help document and did not find any mention of supported formats. There's one about only *.azw, *.txt, *.mobi and *.prc are the only supported formats for the 1st generation kindle. Is it the same for Kindle iOS app? Have you seen any documentation mentioning this? Just asking ....I tried to find some kind of definite proof that I could link to, but could not. I've tried it and it hasn't worked, and a couple months ago I researched this and I found some message boards that said it wasn't possible. Unfortunately, I couldn't find them again today. Also, PDF support is hard for an iPhone app from a user interface point of view, so if Kindle had built it into the app, I assume they would have at least mentioned it somewhere.Thanks Nathan. Good question. The answer is I don't know when the problem started because I didn't notice that it was no longer automatically changing until a few days ago. I don't really know when it stopped working.thanks anyway ... I was gonna use the Kindle app as a reader for my files but seeems it'll be useful only if my Amazon account has a lot of books. Simply adding books via the file transfer method is not primary way of using the app (unless all the books are converted to the correct format, which would be a pain)LastPass does the same thing for a lot less money, and it's available cross-platform (including Linux) so you can keep your passwords synced regardless of where you are and what system you're on.Chrome has also had a lot of trouble with caching (specifically clearing cache) in the recent releases. As a web developer, it's a huge problem. I'm on the verge of moving back to FF.ok i'll take it that i will have it forever thenI'd heard rumors but not confirmation (definitely saw Google use it several times). Thanks for the link.I'm going to vote to close this question. It's not really about automator. How to make a worklow is't a great question since it depends on your skill - but it's a better question than a) what services are not blocked in china b) are they amenable to scripting c) what are your video needs d) how does that interact with a working upload automator script - I'm not saying you don't have a problem or are looking for help, just that it's better to ask five answerable questions instead of one broad one.Go flash free and your memory usage will plummet. From there, you can see which plug ins allocate memory, but in practice - it's flash that really hogs RAM.How much RAM do you have? You will want to keep at least 4X the total RAM free on the hard drive to handle the system needs. It needs to make a sleep image as large as RAM and virtual memory will take space on disk as swap if you open more programs than can fit in RAM.  Look in /private/var/vm to see how much space is used now and reboot to clean out the swap files so you have room to delete things that are needed less urgently than a working system.I agree that 200MB doesn't seem like a lot. Right now mine is hovering just under 1GB. Mind you, I keep a lot of windows open. :)I use iBooks for pdfs, but I convert epubs and use the Kindle app because it is more responsive and less ugly.I picked 6 at random and it worked for 4 out of the six. The other 2 were already grouped for some reason. This is a great start! :Dwhat type is your account? Admin? Regular user? Restricted one? /btw, welcome here :)/glad I could help :-) If so, accept my answer ;-) Thank you!Those two already had an "Album Artist." When I cleared that, all six went into a single group. :) And I'll accept when the time limit has passed.Ah ok, I've forgotten the the limit ^^ sorryAre you logged in on a non-administrator account?Not a real answer, but a great workaround.I have a mid 2007 MacBook (2.16GHZ) with 2GB of RAM and routinely run 15 applications simultaneously, so I need as much RAM as I can get and even when I'm not using it Safari just seems to keep grabbing more kicking on fans and stuff. I've already done the gruber trick with Flash, but it still seems to be the most greedy app I run. That's why I have a desire to write this hack.Awesome, thanks!You're clearly no developer, otherwise you would know how much work a decent iOS or Mac app is. You don't really want to tell me that paying - for a good app, that you use a lot - $2-$5 every year is too much, do you?I was looking arround for answers and found your post in Creative Cow. hahaha Yeah, it seems to me you wont be able to do this keeping your video in 1080p. Sorry, and but good luck!
http://forums.creativecow.net/thread/155/881011Don't worry about downloading Lion itself; [Apple's got you covered](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217786/Apple_Use_our_stores_Wi_Fi_to_download_Lion).Thanks for your informative answer - its exactly what I was looking for. Looks like a mixed network is not a great idea. I think I'll just get an AirPort Extreme/Express combo at some later time after the next update.I've had a long string of successes with Apple to apple networks, extending the network up to 5 base stations. They just work well together.According to the current terms of sale, you get 10 devices up to 5 of which can be computers per store account. http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#SERVICEThere is currently a limit of 5 computers for running licensed software per store account.I'd use this solution over applescript as it's far more efficient with RAM and CPU. Once you find your preferred mymax, you can use launchd to start/quit this script anytime Safari stops/quits. Also `growlnotify --sticky` leaves the alert up until you dismiss it.Do I start this process and leave it running? Then wait for .Trash to show up?We don't have Apple Stores here in New Zealand, so while that looks like a great initiative by Apple, it's not much use to me.That looks interesting, but not if we'll be pinged the NZD $39 for each copy of Lion. If that is the case, I'll have to take the (large) hit on my download allowance, and upgrade each machine separately from the AppStore. I get charged NZD $2 per GB once my data cap has been exceeded, so that will be the cheaper option.You could detach it from the Safari window. It seems that Safari remembers this choice, although it doesn't remember the position of the detached window. Then you can close it with CMD-W.@nathang ... will give this a try as well ....what do you mean by device in airplane mode? do you mean i should set my iphone to airplane mode?Thanks. There were a few leftovers (sym-links) after that. A little bit more left after uninstalling /Developer-old but since the uninstaller completed its job I removed those manually.@VxJasonxV thanks for the edit, but the title was correct to begin with: the Xcode beta I'm using is 4.2, not 4.0.2 per your correction.@vittorio It is interesting that you use the term "service" when you expect to only pay once.  There are two types of things that people pay for, "goods" and "services".  Goods are generally material things that you pay for once and then own forever, like a car.  A service is something that someone does for you once or on an ongoing basis and you pay as you go, like a maid service.  So if an app is a service, then continuing to pay periodically should be expected, no?Yes, you need to keep this running.The problem is that the .ipa file is one that I have made myself with Xcode. My app is not yet in the app store.@Bas I coudn't see any difference even if I logged in as an admin user.I just noticed that `Command` + `H` doesn't work if the current application is the only application that has visible windows. :-/Sadly F.lux is totally automatic and it really doesn't even change the display brightness.Did you sign it with an Ad-hoc distribution profile?If I choose to go for two different SSID, how to configure that the bedroom's one connect to the internet through the PLC and the time capsule? Is this something done in the Airport configuration? Then, would I be able, from the bedroom to connect to my NAS which is in the living room?@bmike & @FallenNicolae I've checked WDS (I'm quite an ignorant in networking) and wander if it would then be better (and in which aspects) to replace my PLC for a third base station I would put in the corridor to keep a continuous signal. Having only one in the corridor and not in the bedroom would be OK on range side but I will then lose the ability to play music from my NAS on my bedroom's hifi system. What would be the benefits then of a 1 capsule and 2 base stations over the PLC solution depicted above?Thanks alot, i was looking for an app that did this kind of thingSpecial keys (like brightnes, volume and playing controls) are not configurable via the Keyboard prefpanefn f8 is available there on my laptop (spaces). I unchecked the use all f1,f2,f3 keys as standard functions under keyboard in system preferences, maybe that's the cause.Actually I'm not at my friends place, but I'm at my work computer and I use Xcode4 both home and at work. Only my iTunes at home is synced with my iPhone. I can get my apps perfectly on my iPhone both at home and at work when using Xcode. I'm experimenting using Adobe FlashBuilder and it generates .ipa files which I would like to get on my iPhone, but since I'm at my job my iTunes is not synced with my device. I was hoping that there is some way to upload .ipa files via iTunes without erasing everything. I use my developer profile as I usually deploy with onto my own device.The .ipa file is something I have made myself using my own provisioning profile and the device is my own iPhone. The iPhone is already set up for "use for developement". I have successfully deployed for my own iPhone many times before using Xcode. I wouldn't normally deploy apps for my own iPhone this way, but with Adobe tools then it's seems to be the way to do it.I'd argue that it's more than cosmetics at play here. There's a function that's purported to be automated, that isn't (for me). I wonder if it works for everyone else?It's not a SandForce-based SSD by any chance is it?ok i've restart my phone and reconnected it to itunes and sync and it says "Sync Complete" but its still stuck at "waiting.." with 0 progress..OK - Did you go to the apps section of iTunes. Is that app downloaded to your PC/Mac? Make sure to download it there. Then turn off syncing for that one app. Then turn on syncing for that app to de-install / re-install it over USB. Hopefully that works. Sorry for the brevity before - I'll edit the answer to try to address your comments here.The Apple retail stores are inviting customers in since there's always free WiFi. Perhaps a local NZ store might offer the same, but that can be awkward with a desktop and a longer drive. Sadly, your internet might make the cost of Lion higher than just the purchase price.I can no longer write about female donkeys, but now my co-worker's name will no longer be misspelled. Thanks.+1 - Very clear explanation bmike. Much appreciated. Yes, it is a home network. A rather weird heirachy here too. Total chaos in fact. When I get the mind to do it, I'll take the MacBook to a public network to see if it can do a better job.By connecting your mac closer to the ISP (directly to a cable or satellite modem rather than through one or more routers) may help things. I don't know how many hops up the routing the software considers, but it's worth a shot.For sure. There's far more NATing going on here than is healthy. I'll check it out tomorrow.That's not exactly what I meant. If you look at the screenshot, there _is_ a location marked, so the feature itself appears to be working.Sorry I wasn't very cleat. I put that location in and the OS claimed the credit!After some test drive of all the available options, I'm staying with this. The interface is decent, and it is easy not only to add subtitles, but also move them around and shift them a bit. Looking at the audio wave is also very useful to correctly put the subtitles in place. Not perfect, but definitely the most usable. Thanks!Sorry, I did give it a second try, but the apparent lack of support of the player for utf8 and accented characters was a mayor hurdle for me.thanks. I can change the desktop background to a specific picture if i click on it.

I've not seen any way to get into the springboard database once it's corrupt. It's really rare as the steps outlined fix many of the instances, but certainly not all.Wow - I'm at a loss. I don't have a list of all the plist files, but if you isolate your mac from a network, and reboot it and only run this one pref pane - fs_usage might show you all the preference files this pane touches. My guess is there are two or three plist in preferences as well as several in a ByHost folder. Rather than muck sometimes I set all my apple plists aside except for mail and test. It's going to be hunting for a needle in the pref file haystack to figure out which ones are corrupt. Have you verified a new account works to be sure it's just a file issue?ah, great to learn that there is a clean solution to this. Thank you Jasarien.@Phillip I have a Bronze plan and it's very reliable, not much Xp with the "deployment" thing (which they happily use a "the" selling point).FYI, this device says that it doesn't support Mac OS X. See the Connecting to Computer section of [the manual.](http://www.voxxsupport.com/images/manuals/VR5220/media/VR5220_DOC_OM.pdf)This sure would be a great thing to bribe the Finder team for a hidden plist to turn this on. It would be so, so handy to economize bandwidth and maintain responsiveness.All you need now is a script that gets triggered to toggle this when you join/leave 3G connections. ;-)[Here is a similar idea at Mac OS X Hints](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100712085231232), using a python script.Ugh - scripting this to crawl a shares worth of folders over a slow network might be a bad idea in the short term as well as restoring the preference once better connected since this flag writes to .DS_Store on the share and not locally.Thanks for the comment. The manual is a bit confusing -- the device itself isn't incompatible with OS X, only the RCA proprietary audio software (which I don't want to use anyway).+1 for Day One. Very niceGreat for annotating PDFs. Notes, highlights, underlines, even freehand drawings.I'm pretty sure this has happened to me too, but has stoped lateley. Anyone? Im on an iMac 2010 with 10.6.7 too.I know that. But in the case of Lion thats 4GB x 2, and because I have a data cap I'm looking to minimize the amount I have to download.Iiiiiiinteresting! I'll totally give that a shot...This is all true for bash functions in general, but I can't get it to work, I don't have a bcat program... edit. I see, bcat is an program by Ryan Tomayko -> http://rtomayko.github.com/bcat/no it still doesn't work. a pile of squres and ?? still..I checked with iTap, they don't support it and have no immediate plans to add support.I don't see any mention of TS RemoteApp in WinAdmin's iTunes description. Could you point me to where you saw it?thanks much -- yep, opt-command-H is the closest I have come.  I would love it if the key command would have the same effect as "switching to finder and then opt-command-H."  in other words -- wherever you were, you are now at finder with the decks cleared.huh! I hadn't done mouse mapping. I have to say, that is one hell of a mouse you are using. I have sort of converted to a touchpadder for now, but who knows. if I switch and want the mouse that can invade fort knox, I know where to find it!    HMM, of course, part of its value is that mapping software.  I wonder if the new OS X will really bowl one over with its gestures, which could maybe invoke a string like "switch to finder and then opt-cmd-H. anyway thanks!IIRC some iMacs have problems after replacing the hard driveWhat hardware are you assigning to the virtual machine? (How much RAM & CPU cores)
Is it only the shutting down that's slow/hangs? Or is working with the VM slow as well?@Sam Brightman No, I don't use Last.FM.Thanks for the explanation. I was able to locate the file using your URL method on my Android device, but there's just no such file on the Mac. Apparently it must be some different version, using some sort of packaged database file or something.. ? Hm.Wait, I must correct myself. Found it. It was in ~/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content Thank you!It was on a blog post that I had saved in instapaper - the article now seems to have been edited. It looks like my information was bad. :-(Mid 2009 iMac models and later have temperature sensors and/or firmware on drives. Putting in a drive that isn't exact can cause iMac blowers to run faster than if the temp sensor was present. This shouldn't be a problem with a three year old iMac.This is all covered in the VirtualBox help file, FWIW... relevant section in the online version: http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sf_mount_manual@glenstorey, I will try again now that 10.6.8 is out.This looks to be a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/6405/5472 - it's likely that a number of reviews are needed to kick an app into the status where reviews become published. Have you tried asking developers on the apple developer forums - they might be more likely to answer there.The built in utility cannot handle 7-Zip amongst other formats.I don't know how it will work with the Lion upgrade, but right now, you don't have to download apps on every machine you want to install them on. You may or may not be asked for your Apple ID when you try to install your already-downloaded app onto another machine, but as I understand it, that is somewhat up to the app author -- I've installed iPhoto '11 on all my Macs this way without being asked for my password.And in the general case, you don't have to download App Store purchases on every computer you want to install them on anyway. You can just download them once and copy them across. See the "Use applications multiple Macs" topic of the App Store help for details.I'm using a Synology DS411j NAS product with Time Machine for network backup out-of-the-box using the regular UI on System Preferences.  I did _not_ have to do the "UnsupportedNetworkVolumes" workaround that you mentioned above.It may depend on your firewall settings. I know from experience that Skype will bind to port 80 if that is the only path through the firewall -- it can't do this on two separate user accounts. Presumably it will work on two separate accounts if it can bind to different ports.@scrrr That's very strange. It's in ~/Documents OMM. Maybe that changes based on the version of the Kindle app...I'll second the old Mac post as that's what I use too. In my case I have an old Mac Mini (1.4GHz G4) with 2 x 1TB 2.5" external USB drives. It runs iTunes as the data source for my AppleTV in the living room and NFSd for dishing out ISO files for my ESX server in my home lab.Actually, there is :-)bmike is right; this is a duplicate. Also, in the future, please keep the rant out of your question. The words "I don't know what's wrong with..." are unnecessary. Thanks for your cooperation.Thank you :), is Snow Leopard the next one up from Leopard? Still a little uneasy about upgrading from Tiger as I'm wondering if it may effect any of my other programs that all run fine in Tiger. Is it something to be concerned about? Can you always go back to Tiger if Leopard has issues? Thank you for reading :)Thanks! I couldn't tell whether it was an either/or trade-off: "You have two radios, and you can either use them both for one net, or use one for the private net and the other for the Guest net."That adds very little protection and is not very convenient.I have 8GB of total RAM in my MacBookPro and I'm assigned 4GB of RAM to Virtual Machine. The processor is configured to use 2 processor cores. Under this settings, I don't see a possible that RAM or CPU is slowing it down..what else?Hey Jordan. This may get closed, as questions about publicly unreleased Apple software are outside of this site's scope.Fair enough. It's good enough for basic zips and tars but if you need more Stuffit handles it and it's free on the app store or as a stand alone. The option to set it as default is right there in it's settings as well which is niceGenerally speaking you use Xcode to update, what went wrong?Isn't that what @Patrick is referring to in his first sentence?@Dori It is.Full size keyboards do have a delete button.I see it is the command-line interface for the `System Profiler.app`. Sadly, on desktops, it just shows the settings from `EnergySaver.prefpane` and if an UPS is installed.Actually operating the MacBook with closed lid ("closed clamshell mode") is not a problem and supported by Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3131I think you'll need to split the file into different parts - MKV is just a container formatOh, I didn't see your spaces line! That's what I'm missing. See, I thought you were just suggesting hiding everything and switching to Finder, which seemed like a step backwards to me... My bad, I see your point now.Joining the tracks in GarageBand or Audacity would work, but isn't a convenient option to be sure.You should be able to configure VB to share USB devices. Is that not working?If "Now everything is fine", what are you asking? Do you want to know why this happened? A way to fix this without restarting?

I tried adding it to every calendar (On My Phone, Gmail, MobileMe, and iCalserver) and could delete it from them all. Is there anything special about the event? Are there attendees or attachments?There are Attendees (just me) but no attachmentsI was able to reproduce the same circumstance with an event with an attendee.  Unfortunately, I think the actual answer is: **"You don't.  Wait for a bug fix"**@andersmoldin Valid, though I believe my point stands: No Mac ships with an extended keyboard by default, MacBooks all have the standard keyboard, and if you go to the Apple site and click on Mac accessories, then keyboard, they refer exclusively to the standard keyboard. You have to actually click on the little ad-like link at the bottom to see the extended version.Hi Nathan, I installed some updates today and now its working. But still I do not know where it is mounted under Mac (in Ubuntu I can look under /dev/input to see, if its mounted).Not at all - I'm showing you manual exists in all of my Light Tables. Perhaps you need to rerrange at least one thumbnail for manual to exist. (perhaps there isn't a manual ordering until you make one by reordering one of the others)this is *exactly* the answer I needed. Albums were my missing bit of tech in iPhoto -- I wasn't using them.

Thanks for your cooperation.Are you looking to move the OSX installer to a drive or just have a second bootable device. If the latter, simply format the USB drive and install OSX onto the drive. Update the software periodically and you are done. Moving the installer to the USB takes a little more effort.Alex - If you look, I'm trying to show a recipe for making "cake" instead of downloading one that's already baked. If you feel that's shady (or by inference, me), you are welcome to that opinion. I do hope you stick around and participate since you obviously have some deep knowledge based on all of your answers here so far, and you might even be really nice in person. My skin is thick, so call me any names you want if you feel it helps you or the site. Editing away the meat of your answer wasn't something I would do, so I posted. I respect your voice even if I disagree with some of it.No - the DVD and USB are equivalent read only devices. To "bake in" updates to the installer packages, you have to be able to parse/edit installer packages and read/edit/correct the pre-install and post-install scripts. It's much faster (& safer) to just store the combo updater on the device and run that later or use DeployStudio to snap a version of the installed software for distribution. It's a great idea, just more work than you might guess in general. 10.7 all bets are off since it will use the app store to validate a purchase and wants to install over SL only as it's currently describedno offense intended. I'll delete my comment about the words that Nathan edited.

I wonder if there are some others that would like to contribute to this debate. Cheers for providing a testimonial on 1Password. I've heard many good things and I'll look into it now.It works. I'm now at work and I can now install the .ipa files generated with FlashBuilder on my iPhone and it runs.

How do I convert multiple files in batch? And since changing the container is so simple why can't final cut do it :SMany thanks, I think this is (sadly!) the only way forward. I actually ended up using Magic Launch, a slightly less complex alternative to RCDefaultApp. Since you created your answer as a community wiki I've gone ahead and appended details of Magic Launch to it for the benefit of others. Enjoy your 50 reputation points! :)Unfortunately, I'm using a background colour for the heading and increasing the spacing before the paragraph will only increase the size of that background, it won't create a space between it and the previous paragraph like I'm showing in the screenshot.`asr` is a bit smarter about blessing a bootable volume and HFS than `dd` or `cp` and more likely to work with metadata, hfs compression and other nice things to have on limited storage space...Personally I just don't buy an app twice, but of course I send back the best feedback if it's good and I suggest it to friends. That's what a big piece of users do in App Store. Rovio team has sold Angry Birds [6.5 millions of times](http://tinyurl.com/37g3rzj) (if 0.99$ for every sale they have now 6.43 millions of $), and couting. We aren't talking of games like Crysis 2 (22 millions of develop costs). It's hard for me to believe it isn't good for an App developer, now iPhone users are [100 milions](http://tinyurl.com/2d3twjz) (and counting) so there is a big margin on an app like this.Sorry, that makes my answer not helpful to you. One work-around I can think of now is to make a copy the "body" style and call it "Last paragraph style". Then add space "After Paragraph" of the new style. Then apply this style to the last paragraph of each section. But this is hack-y and a little annoying to keep up. You would get consistency, however.@Lee sorry for the bad explanation, an App do a service for you, like view a pdf, optimize the battery of your device during charge process, or apply a color filter to an image from your device library. I understand a developer would like to sell an app every time he upgrade it, but the market speaks better than me, people just don't like to buy an app twice. But of course people buy apps in excess if they will have them for their class devices forever. Basically this is the reason why I've wrote this question and probably why iPhone has sold so much. Lower price == more buyersCorrect. This is exactly the thing I'd suggest.trust me, I wish i was less abrasive, it would serve me well in life. but like big glossy screens, we are dealt the hand we've got... and have to just try to get  through the game ;-)  redundant:_yes_ :: when in Rome:_I'm here aren't I?_   re: glossiness; But why did apple change their "lustre" after all these years?

If some units doesn't meet the requirements, doesn't that mean you couldn't really support them anyway?Btw 300+ readers: There seem to be a reasonable handful of questions around here that could benefit from an active-directory tag.How do people usually do ? I mean it's obvious that it needs spacing and I'm not the only one using Pages.Yes, of course. However, there are some very nice new development tools that are iOS 5-specific (I'm looking at you, Storyboarding). I'd like to use them, but I need to determine if it's feasible to support only iOS 5. (I'm guessing not, but I'd like to be surprised.)Both Nathan and mipadi provide answers, but I think they're only partial answers, so I added one. I'm not sure if it would have been better to combine their responses somehow, and if so, how to have done that.Notice that I'm not sure that the convention of passing the file name argument directly to the application's name on the command line may not work for all applications. Only applications that are built to accept filenames on the command line as valid arguments for opening will work this way. I *think* that the more general `open` command uses a more thorough method to get an application to "open" the file argument passed to the open command (i.e. it depends on the same functionality by which the Finder's "double click to open" action works).Having a space before a header happens all the time in book publishing, including back ground colors, but different applications handle that styling differently. Without getting into too deep of details, in Adobe InDesign the background color of a header wouldn't be an issue because of the way a background would need to be generated (hint: InDesign does not have a background color property for paragraph or character styles so under- or over-lines are used). You are just going to have to get crafty working around Pages' current behavior.@Viktor Haag: Both of those will work with TextEdit.I believe there is (and certainly was at one point) a mechanism to kick start things when the drive is gone for some days time, but can't pin it down in code or using google at the moment. Also, how the drive is connected and whether a user is logged in also seems to matter.I am fairly new as an iOS developer (yeah, right, I fired up Xcode yesterday and suddenly I'm an iOS developer) but does those features produce iOS 5.0 code, or are they only available in the new Xcode version? I ask because I was under the impression that when iOS 5.0 is released as final, you'll have to build with the latest Xcode anyway. But, I might be talking out of my $!% now, I have no idea really :)Do you notice this when switching between headphones in and out? There are at least three distinct volume settings on the device: no headphones (internal speaker), regular headphones, and headphones with remote and mic. Are you noticing settings changes that this is affecting?Connected, as in the type of interface used (e.g. USB/FireWire)?TimeCapsule or Connected to OS X Server as a network share and using sparse disk bundle versus a physical disk over USB/FireWire/ThunderBolt/whatever where the backup is stored as a folder.The Time Capsule is the only router on the network.  I have no idea how to set it all up for IPv6 and I am not really happy with it because I use one Mac as a server that I VNC to and the Ubuntu VM as a test web server.  I can't even connect to the Ubuntu VM from the machine running it because of the different IP ranges.  
Also, ALL machines on the network are set to use DHCP automatically, there is NOTHING defined specifically on ANY machine.Go for it on the rewrite.  I am beginning to think the problem may be my ISP.  It's a local "wireless" (cell phone technology) ISP, but I never had this problem with them before (before, meaning on my other Routers)@Viktor it generally isn't good to re-post things that people have already said, and exact duplicates are removed. Since you had something to add, good ways to go would be an answer saying "In addition to Nathan and mipadi's techniques...", or comments on those answers with your addendums. What you've done here is okay, but not exactly a 'best practice'. Thanks for asking; now you know for the future :-).Well, manually assigning the IP, Subnet Mask and Default Gateway as the Router fixed the issue for now.  Here's hoping it stays this way after reboot.If your VPN software prevents this (some are set up to only work if ALL traffic goes over the VPN) you will have a hard time of this. If is doesn't restrict, then you simply make the latter connection's router as the default route and set up network routing for each network you want to go through the VPN.@Pselus let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/641/discussion-between-bmike-and-pselus)@bmike: Can you explain a little more how to do what you propose?

I don't know how much detail you want on networking... http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/643/discussion-with-bmikeOut of luck = I lost my work in the AD session (pretty sure I saved most stuff, tho) and it was a bit annoying to have to go through all the same config on the local account that I had already done on the AD account, but it worked. Thanks!I will response with screenshots when I get a chanceMay I ask why I got downvoted?Why do you say "built-in"?@GEdgar because iMovie comes with Mac OS X. It's 'built-in' to the system. You're right, it probably isn't the best choice of words, but it is true.I belive I have installed it...I CAN go to the terminal and say 
brightness 0
and have the screen go dark... but it won't work in the script...but I will try this other way and let you knowIf you can list a subset of the data you want to combine, that might be more workable than the general "combine everything" which isn't feasable.also when I use either of those scripts I JUST see the sun that shows how bright the screen is...without it changing at all... =( I think I am doing something wrong...@bmike - applications, documents and settingsYou can re-run the assistant to move applications as they exist in /Applications. Any documents and settings can be moved to the new desktop. Settings are harder since you can choose one finder setting - the old or the new, not just merge them. Apps from ~/Applications can be copied easily. Settings are from ~/Library/Preferences mostly. Some like sync Dara are stored elsewhere in ~/LibraryI generally don't recommend cross-over for general use, but in MS Publisher case, if you have a copy of the app, it runs fairly well in crossover emulation.

I mean the best integrated sound system (imac had harman kardon and were fanless: really surprising quality)If you open console app - is there anything useful or worth posting from /private/var/log/system.log - I would try to launch one 3PP app several times, and maybe repeat with a second app that is a bit different (don't run two Office apps or two adobe apps - make them from different vendors)I added a crashdump. What do you mean by '3pp'?Actually it sounds rather hard to bend AppleScript to this task. Why not just use folder actions to kick off your already done upload script and save your snaps in the folder? Also skitch is what I use, but you might want to learn script and not just solve this one issue.Love HyperDock!  It also adds an Aero Peek affect (window preview by hovering over the dock icon.)@mjrider Can you take a screenshot of just the Run Shell Script action for me? That's weird with the scripts; they now do that on mine too. I wonder why they aren't working...Sorry - third party product. 3PP is software not made by apple. Would you also consider looking at four or five crashes - the individual report that lives in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter - the three lines that mention " Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Codes: 0x000000000000000d, 0x0000000000000000

Disregard previous answer.it is installed there as stated in above tutorial http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090901021817717Now that's a great answer! Awesome find - I'm really curious to see the crashes in this case.@mjrider: I don't see a specific place mentioned in the main text, but I do see `/usr/local/bin` and `/Library` (not a good idea) mentioned. But *neither of these places is in `PATH` by default*, so you must use the full path to *where you actually installed it*.@kevin reid http://www.screencast.com/t/Od4RTdNt5NRY I did place it in /user/local/bin. I can run this command from terminal right off the bat without any other command. and it works find http://www.screencast.com/t/Bkyv91LPySNThat's because you have `/usr/local/bin` configured in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`. Programs not running from a Terminal will not have these settings. **Use the full path to the command in your Automator configuration.**OOOHHHH so insted of "brightness 1" use "/usr/local/bin/brightness 1" IN THE SCRIPT in automator? (wasn't quite clear in your answer thats what you ment)beautiful that works...I still would edit your answer to make it more clear thats what you ment. thanksSorry, I couldn't hyperlink everything, new user.Until you delete the message, IMAP has to keep a copy on the server in the folders wherein that attachment and message reside.Very unconventional, but nice. Solves the problem, especially if I use a name that doesn't exist (so it doesn't send any unnecessary mails).This would be for a few hundred machines. :)Then you're golden. You'll already know to run updates only on a few and test so you'll catch things and be able to rsync / deploy / patch files. This will just be one more thing on your long list of things you customize on deploy. (You are using automator and Remote Desktop Admin to manage these macs centrally, no ?!!?)+1 Wow, I have learned something! Good trick!OK. Is there a way to completely sync the 2 accounts ? (gmail and apple one ?). What I mean.. to store sent messages, inbox.. everything 1-1 copy ?@Patrick Not that I know of, sorry.Thanks for the response. It is almost correct. iMovie cannot handle M4Vs. So you have to go back to HandBrake and output the movies in MP4 format. At that point, you can use iMovie to stitch them togetherOk, thanks. They didn't put it in Macbook Air's page. I'm using the battery from just the one generation before they made this 1000 cycles, and it wouldn't hold any longer than 2 hours now... Here's hoping that my new laptop will last 7 hours for 5 years...Then I must ask: why is it labelled Delete ?I actually don't know; maybe ask it as a question here. ;)I can see that it wouldn't be labelled Backspace because thanks to the modifier key it can erase both ways. But I don't see why the label is different on AZERTY when the behaviour is the same.@Julien iMovie can handle anything that QuickTime can, including M4V videos. Unless you're using some strange codec, you should be able to use them...Man... XCode is not actually installed, that's the problem (thus Xcode binary is not in my system). Yes, some time ago, Apple published XCode on iTunes ($4 dollars, which is good for someone like me who don't want to get into the Apple Developer program which cost $99 yearly). So... the problem here is that iTunes *thinks* XCode is installed, but it's not... so how can I tell iTunes that XCode is not installed at all?I appreciate the suggestion, but it's not a disk problem I'm trying to isolate.Actually, @Cristian, you can download it for free from http://developer.apple.comMan, I was not able... some months ago I installed Xcode 3.X (on other mac) for free from apple's web site. But now I can't find a link to download the .dmg (and that's why I tried to download it from **App Store**, not iTunes... it was a typo, sorry, I'm kind of tired XD).XCode 3.6 *is* free. XCode 4.0 os **not** free. You do need a free developer account to download 3.6 (not the paid account).I've stumbled across a firewall app before that can graph network usage per app and per user... but I can't seem to find it anymore. :/Thanks man !...It is indeed: drwx------  3 root  staff  102 Jun 27 08:52 /Users/aneuryzma/.Trash@geekosaur Should I change the permissions to 777 ?And this is far better than the MS Paint optionMake sure to keep the lid open while the computer is turned on.

I still want messages showing (and notifying) in the inbox as unread, because that's what I monitor, but I don't want to stop the message from going to "all mail" in imap, since I use that as a safety net for messages I've archived or deleted from my inbox that I later want to see from the mail app.did you clear your cache?what is the model of your MacBook Air?@bckbck: I tried that now, but it didn't work.try going to many many sites and try typing it again. does autocomplete work?it says model number is A1237HandsOff shows per-app usage@bot47 Own answers can be accepted only after two days after the question was asked.Oh, OK 9 more to go...`sudo chown $USER ~/.Trash ~/.Trash/.DS_Store` is all you should need to do.I tried downloading and installing.
